Embarking on a solo journey to a new international city after nearly three years, I found myself captivated by the charm of Lisbon. Drawn by the bustling Christmas markets, beautiful Portuguese landscapes, and the promise of hospitable weather, I set out to navigate the streets of Lisbon for seven unforgettable days.
So, join me on this solo travel diary as I share the highs, lows, and the incredible experiences that made Lisbon a city to remember.
Day 1: Arrival and First Impressions
After a lengthy 16-hour Etihad flight, I touched down in Lisbon on the 18th of December. Checking into the Room007 Lisbon (BlueSock Hostels) at 8 am, I dropped off my luggage and set out for a walking tour to shake off the travel weariness. Despite exhaustion, the enchanting city beckoned, leading me to explore its streets and indulge in a delightful lunch. Day one in Lisbon ended with a well-deserved rest, setting the tone for the days to come.
Sharing a few pictures from my walking tour
Day 2: Sintra, Cascais, and Conversations
On day 2, I embarked on a day trip that promised to reveal the wonders beyond the city limits. My first destination for the day was Sintra, a charming town known for its fairy-tale-like Pena Palace and captivating landscapes.
The tour was booked through GetYourGuide (tour company LaneTours). As we set out on our journey, I found myself among a diverse group of fellow explorers — two Serbians living in Germany, a Cuban traveler, and, of course, our Angolian-Portuguese guide, Antonio. The camaraderie within the group instantly set a positive tone for the day.
Our first stop was the awe-inspiring Pena Palace, perched on a hill overlooking Sintra. The entry fee of 14 euros was well worth it, especially since I had booked online to avoid queues and enjoy a discount. The palace, with its vibrant colors and intricate architecture, transported us into a realm of fantasy.
Next on the itinerary was Quinta da Regaleira, another palace adorned with mysticism and symbolism. Although we could only admire it from the outside, the sheer grandeur of the structure left a lasting impression. The tour continued through the quaint village of Sintra, where I couldn’t resist indulging in some window shopping and, of course, savoring the famous pastéis de nata.
We stopped for lunch at Taverna dos Trovadores. Conversations >> Lunch.
Our journey then took us to the westernmost point in Europe, Cabo da Roca. The windswept cliffs and the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean created a mesmerizing scene, offering a perfect backdrop for group photos despite the struggle with cold winds.
From there, we ventured to Cascais, a charming coastal town where the President of Portugal resides. As we explored the city, a delightful surprise unfolded within our group — a heartwarming marriage proposal, adding an extra touch of romance to the day.
The tour concluded with a leisurely walk around Cascais, saw President’s house (no doubt, he loves to stay in these serene town away from Lisbon), immersing ourselves in its picturesque streets and absorbing the coastal charm.
I requested a drop off at the Rossio Christmas Market, where I spent some time soaking in the festive atmosphere before heading back to my hostel.
Apart from the beautiful landscapes I saw today, the conversations with fellow travellers, especially knowing there is a language barrier, was simply amazing.
Btw, another shop for Ginja recommended by locals is this —
Day 3: Belem
Opting for a more relaxed day, I decided to forego the structured day tours and instead immerse myself in the rich historical tapestry of Belem. This historic district, located to the west of Lisbon, promised a deep dive into Portugal’s colonial past and presented a unique opportunity to explore on foot at a leisurely pace.
The day began with Delta Coffee House, a must-try spot near my hostel. Fueled by a cup of robust coffee, I embarked on a walking tour through Belem.
The walk started from the Praça Afonso de Albuquerque, a square that radiates historical significance. As my guide delved into the history of colonialism, I couldn’t help but notice the nuanced acknowledgment of its complexities of colonialism and ‘exploration’.
Our journey continued to the Pavilhão Sala Thai, an architectural gem, and then to the iconic Jerónimos Monastery. The intricate details of the monastery, adorned with Manueline-style architecture, left me in awe.
The tour progressed to the Discovery Monument, a tribute to Portugal’s Age of Discovery, symbolizing the nation’s maritime achievements (and colonial past).
Belem Tower, a fortress turned into a prison, at the mouth of the Tagus River, stood as a sentinel to Portugal’s maritime history.
The walking tour provided not only a visual feast but also a contextual understanding of the glorification of colonialism that permeates throughout Europe.
If you are in Belem, the visit to the renowned Pasteis de Belem is a no-brainer. I indulged in the most authentic pastel de nata, savoring the flavors that have become synonymous with Portuguese pastry.
The day ended on a slightly challenging note as a persistent throbbing headache forced me back to my hostel, where after a hot cup of ginger tea and medicine, and a very heavy dinner at Antikuario Café, I decided to call it a day.
Day 4: Journey through Batalha, Nazare, Fatima, and Obidos
The day’s itinerary promised a journey through historical landmarks, picturesque landscapes, and charming villages. I had booked a guided tour with LaneTours (GetYourGuide), opting for the same knowledgeable guide, Antonio, who had enriched my Sintra experience earlier in the week.
Our group, a delightful mix of fellow travelers including a friendly family from Colorado, set out from Lisbon with our first destination being Batalha. The town’s name, hinting at a historical battle, immediately piqued my interest. Our visit centered around the Batalha Monastery, a masterpiece of Portuguese Gothic architecture. As Antonio shared fascinating stories and insights, the intricate details of the monastery came to life, revealing its significance in Portuguese history.
From Batalha, our journey led us to the coastal gem of Nazare. Famed for having the tallest waves in the world, Nazare is a surfer’s paradise. Despite being unable to get close to the waves due to their height, we hiked down the mountain and the panoramic views of the coastline were nothing short of breathtaking.
A short drive took us to the fishing village of Nazare, where we enjoyed lunch at Taberna do Pouca Roupa, a distinctly Portuguese restaurant.
Our next stop was the highlight of the day — the Queen’s village of Obidos. This romantic and colorful village, with its narrow streets and medieval charm, was hosting a Harry Potter-themed Christmas market, adding an extra layer of magic to the experience.
Obidos is not only a visual delight but also renowned for its Ginjinha, a sour cherry liquor. I made sure to pick up a bottle as a souvenir, a taste of Portugal’s natural treasure. My guide told me this is one of oldest Ginja shops in Obidos so if you can just blindly trust their quality.
Dropped off near the Winter Wonderland Christmas Market, I took some time to wander through the festive stalls, sampling local treats like vegan empanadas, farturas, hot chocolate, some roasted CASTANHS, and enjoying the vibrant atmosphere before heading back to the hostel. I become a 5 year old kid in a Christmas market.
Day 5: Sesimbra and Arrabida National Park
I woke up with a mild chill and fever. Determined not to miss out on one of the experiences I had been eagerly anticipating, I reached for the medication, hoping to alleviate the symptoms that threatened to dampen the excitement I had for the day.
I booked this tour through GetYourGuide (Lisbon Riders). Caroline’s, our spirited Portuguese guide, infectious energy and passion for sharing the beauty of her homeland became a source of inspiration. The initial lethargy and malaise began to dissipate as the tour unfolded.
The tour group, by a stroke of luck, comprised an all-female ensemble. Led by Carolina, the group dynamic immediately set a tone of camaraderie and shared excitement. Despite feeling under the weather, the prospect of exploring the coastal gems kept my spirits high.
Our first stop, Canó Espichel, introduced us to an old chapel surrounded by legends and myths. The quiet and peaceful atmosphere, devoid of the usual tourist crowds, allowed for a serene exploration of the historic site.
Moving on, we arrived at Castelo de Sesimbra, a unique church showcasing typical Portuguese-Moorish style blue tile work. The lack of heavy tourist footfall added to the charm, allowing us to appreciate the beauty of the church without distractions.
The fishing village of Sesimbra, with its picturesque Praia de Sesimbra (Beach of Sesimbra), became the next chapter of our exploration. A warm bowl of soup at Aloha cafe (VEGAN) not only provided comfort but also allowed me to soak in the sun, which suddenly made me feel so much better.
The journey continued to Arrabida National Park where, Carolina’s engaging narration, coupled with the breathtaking scenery, made this stop a memorable one.
Next on the itinerary was Quinta de Alcube Vinhos for a wine tasting experience. The private vineyard provided a delightful setting to sample Portuguese wines. Though not a wine connoisseur, I appreciated the freshness and quality of the wines, complemented by the farm’s exotic animals, and the sight of Portugal’s natural treasure — the Cork Trees.
Our final surprise stop was Christ the King (Cristo Rei).While not on the trips itinerary, Carolina decided to show us around since we had some extra time (so sweet of her!). The panoramic views of Lisbon and the Tagus River added a touch of grandeur to our coastal excursion.
Returning to my room, I couldn’t help but appreciate the resilience that travel brings. Despite feeling under the weather, Carolina’s energy and the stunning landscapes of Sesimbra and Arrabida had turned the day into a therapeutic retreat by the sea.
Day 6: Exploring Lisbon on foot
After a good night’s sleep and recovering from. Determined to make the most of my time in this enchanting city, I decided to dedicate the day to personal exploration, taking a break from guided tours and allowing spontaneity to be my guide.
Beginning the day a bit later than usual, I embarked on a practical task — laundry. A laundry place near my hostel for washing and drying in 7 euros.
I set off to explore some items on my Lisbon bucket list. First on the agenda was the famous flea market, aptly referred to as the “Thieves Market,” situated behind the Pantheon. This bustling marketplace, open only on Saturdays and Tuesdays, turned out to be a treasure trove for antique enthusiasts. The prices were surprisingly reasonable, making it a must-visit for collectors and curious wanderers alike.
Adjacent to the flea market, the Pantheon and its neighboring church stood as stoic witnesses to centuries of history.
While I admired their grandeur from the outside, my curiosity led me to my next destination — Pink Street. Unfortunately, this hyped-up location failed to live up to expectations, serving as a reminder that not every tourist hotspot lives up to the buzz.
A stroke of luck led me to the discovery of Kong, an amazing vegan eatery that reimagines local Portuguese cuisines into plant-based delights. A true find for a vegetarian like myself, Kong offered a delicious and ethical culinary experience.
Determined to catch a mesmerizing sunset, I referred to the list shared by our Belem guide and made my way to Mirador (viewpoint) de Santa Catalina. While the view was slightly marred by construction work, I managed to capture some captivating moments nonetheless. Also, I got to take a ride in the famou Tram 22 (unknowingly!)
Not entirely satisfied, I decided to explore further and stumbled upon Miradouro de São Pedro de Alcântara. This hidden gem, complete with a cute Christmas market, proved to be the perfect spot to watch the sun bid farewell to another day in Lisbon.
As evening descended, I concluded my day with an early dinner at a small café behind my hostel, indulging in a falafel wrap. A quick grocery run to Aldi for some fruits and a warm cup of ginger tea marked the end of a day filled with personal discoveries and a leisurely exploration of Lisbon.
Day 7: Christmas Eve
As I woke up this day, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of accomplishment and gratitude for the incredible experiences this city had bestowed upon me in the last one week.
The day commenced with a craving for pancakes, and a quick search led me to the renowned breakfast place, Zenith, conveniently located behind my hostel.
In need of some fresh air and sunshine, I decided to take a leisurely stroll in Torell Jardim (garden). The peaceful ambience, coupled with a panoramic view of the city, proved to be a serene retreat. Every step felt like a reward for the hustle and bustle of daily life, a luxury often elusive in the bustling cityscape of my hometown in India.
I changed my accomodation from hostel to a hotel for a more sophisticated and luxurious Christmas Eve (:P). After the check-in and afternoon siesta, at around 3 pm, I set out for a walk in the city, capturing the essence of Lisbon’s vibrant squares and landmarks as they adorned themselves in festive lights.
Praca de Commercio, with its iconic yellow buildings, served as a picturesque starting point.
The promenade in front of the Commerce Square offered a breathtaking view of the sun setting over the Golden Gate Bridge of Lisbon, creating a moment of pure magic.
After the spectacular sunset, I continued walking to witness Christmas illuminations at various squares, starting with the 1) Rossoio Christmas market, which, although closed on Christmas Eve, emanated a festive charm few days back. The famous hotel 2) Apmazens do Chiado treated me to a mesmerizing Christmas light show.
3) Praça Luís de Camões, with its festive adornments, became a beacon of Christmas spirit, and the lively atmosphere of the square added a musical touch to the celebrations. As I meandered through the city, reveling in the twinkling lights and festive decorations, the charm of Christmas Eve in Lisbon unfolded before me.
The experience of witnessing the city aglow with holiday spirit, coupled with the joyous energy of fellow revelers, made Christmas Eve in Lisbon a memory to cherish. It’s difficult to capture the vibe through still photos so if you want to see more, you can visit the Portugal highlight on my Instagram page.
As the night deepened, I returned to my hotel, waiting for Christmas and my Santa to arrive.
Reflecting on the week’s solo travel through the captivating landscapes and rich history of Lisbon, I felt a sense of fulfillment and boost of self-confidence. Lisbon had not only been a destination but a catalyst for the re-beginning of my solo adventures in the years to come.
The enchantment of the Portuguese capital had sparked a renewed sense of wanderlust, and as I awaited the next chapter of my holiday with my husband, I knew that Lisbon had become a timeless chapter in my solo travel journey.
PS — Another interesting activity I did in Lisbon (not solo though) was the boat tour in Tagus river. Booked through Airbnb (with Sailing4U), it was a breathtaking experience along with river learning about Lisbon’s past and present, very different from the exploration I did so far in Lisbon on foot.
Tips/Codes/Itinerary
2. Metro card — Navigante is very popular in Lisbon
3. Room007 hostel is quite decent. Good location. Clean. However, you won’t get a lot of amenities like kitchen, laundry, etc. but the cost is very affordable.
4. Book walking tours on the first few days to understand the city’s culture and history before you start exploring it yourself — I use Guruwalk to book my free walking tours
5. Finally, I really found the guided tours with GetYourGuide for long trips like Sintra, Nazare, etc., very useful and comfortable. Also, you meet new people so you don’t get bored alone. If you want to book directly, you can consider LaneTours (Antonio) and Lisbon Riders (Caroline).
If you are travelling to Portugal, in particular to Lisbon, Lagos, and Porto, you can reach out to me LinkedIn or Instagram for more local tips and places to eat/visit/viewpoints. I can share on email places to visit, restaurants, local eateries, and view points.

Lisbon can only be truly felt when you make your way through its historic neighbourhoods, with centuries worth of stories to disclose. You’ll find narrow, labyrinth-like streets, yellow trams taking locals and tourist up and down the steep hills, stunning views overlooking the river, colourful architecture, unique cobblestone pavements, balconies with hanging laundry drying in the wind, and so much more.
So take our advise. Put on your best walking shoes, and stroll along this five iconic streets of the city of the seven hills.
Quite possibly the most famous street of the capital. Also the most touristy one. You’ll find a number of shops, restaurants, and outdoor cafes (look out for the tourist traps though 😬). Rua Augusta connects two important squares — Praça do Comércio and Rossio — and it was built after the 1755 earthquake which destroyed Lisbon’s Downtown.
The top of Rua Augusta Arch is actually a viewpoint where you’ll get a birds’ eye view not only of the street, but all of downtown and the Tagus river.
Champs-Elysées, in Paris, served as inspiration for the “Liberty Avenue”. It’s known for its many luxury stores and hotels.
This spacious boulevard is almost 1,1 kms long and makes a pleasant walk while touring the city. Stroll under the shady trees, and remember to look down as you walk to admire the beautiful Portuguese cobblestone.
Certainly one of the local’s favourites, particularly during Christmas time, with it’s Christmas decorations and several international brands stores where to buy presents.
Here you’ll find one of the most famous Lisbon’s cafes — A Brasileira — dating back to 1905 and a meeting place for artists, writers and intellectuals. Permanently sitting outside is one of those writers — Fernando Pessoa — who’s depicted in a bronze statue, seated at a table. Also in this street you’ll find the oldest bookshop in the world — Bertrand.
With its picturesque yellow funicular going up and down the steep hill, and the stunning view over the Tagus, Rua da Bica is certainly a highlight of any tour around the city.
If you’re looking for the liveliest, most entertaining street head straight to Pink Street, in Cais do Sodré. It’s name comes, of course, from the pink tar carpet. You’ll find several bars and cafes where you can enjoy a drink.
Have you strolled around any of these streets? Would you add any others? Let us know. 👇

I Won’t lie to you, Lisbon isn’t comfortable.
I mean,Yes, there is a flat area that you can walk around and it’s easy to move,
But, generally speaking, you’ll either be going up or down some part of a mountain made up of old cobblestones.
It is the “city of seven hills” you know?, Same as Rome.
So, whatever you’re planning on doing around here,

Picture a twinkling skyline, intricate statues, and a vibrant lifestyle.
Lisbon provides a genuine European feel with its shingled roofs and eccentric cathedrals. You’ll stroll through shaded cobblestone streets and a variety of outdoor restaurants.
But enough of the summary, let me walk you through our adventure in this sensational capitol:
We touched down in Lisbon late at night due to some intrusive travel delays which you can read more about here:
medium.com
Even at night, Lisbon is spectacular. The Portuguese eat late so there were still people out, but most of the businesses were closed at about midnight. We ended up going to- guess where- yeah that’s right- McDonald’s!
Our itinerary was in place so we would be ready to go the next day.

Lisbon has become an impossible city. It is not new, though; I think it always has been.
It is a city without nature, where satellite cities were built in desert wastelands, and four trees are enough for ten thousand people in some square suddenly built to make people feel less apprehensive.
Entire neighborhoods were built on this principle.
Buildings one behind the other, looking like pieces of dominoes, housing thousands of souls in their mini apartments where not even a balcony exists.
Around them, in what was eventually called a city, you soon realize that there is no economic life. Those who live there only use them as a place to sleep, spending their lives working in Lisbon and spending the rest between three to four hours of hellish traffic commuting.
The car becomes the second home in a place in Portugal where public transportation works poorly or is non-existent.
But of course, I am…

When I left Paris — after visiting a few cities in France, I headed to Lisbon, Portugal. After all, I was already in Europe. So, why not explore more than just France — thus killing two or three birds with one stone? (No birds were harmed during this trip).
As my Uber driver approached where my hotel was located, I saw a bridge. A long one! And as we got closer, I was taken aback by its resemblance to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
I was like, wait a minute, where am I?
The Ponte 25 de Abril (the 25th of April Bridge in English), connects the city of Lisbon to the municipality of Almada. I later learned that it was built by an American Bridge Company, and one can see where the inspiration for the design came from. The bridge’s upper section accommodates cars and the section under is for trains. However, unlike the Golden Gate Bridge, Ponte 25 de Abril doesn’t allow pedestrians or biking on the bridge.
As I gazed into the distance, I saw a statue. I later read that it was called Christ The King — a Catholic monument and shrine overlooking the city of Lisbon and was inspired by the…

This historic city has delicious seafood, unique local music, and stunning views
The gates of old Lisbon can be seen through the colorful houses and streets. (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
I’ve just got back from exploring one of the warmest, most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited: Lisbon
After a week of exploring Portugal’s capital, I’ve come up with some must-dos for making the most out of your visit.
The beautiful gates of old Lisbon (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
The internal transportation system in Lisbon is easy to use: you go to any metro station and from the machines there buy a Viva Viagem card for 50 cents. You then charge the card as much as you want, in increments of 3, 5, and 10 euros.
Once you’ve charged your card, you can select what kind of ticket you want to use it for. You can “zap” in and out of the metro and some buses by touching the card over a scanner at the beginning and end of each journey. This will automatically deduct the cost of your trip from your card’s total.
Alternatively, before you begin your day’s travel you can choose to buy a day pass the ticket on the card for 6 euros, which may work out cheaper.
Pro tip: Get two cards — one for zapping, and one to use if you needed a day pass.
Lisbon is famous for its seafood and for its pastries. There is a lot to try, but if I had to recommend just two must-eats, they would be Bacalhau (salted cod) and Pastel de nata (custard tartlets).
Pastel de nata (amazing Portuguese pastry made from custard), is something you can’t miss when visiting Lisbon
Pastel de nata is one of the most common and well-known Portuguese pastries, and every visitor to Lisbon should try them. Pasteis de Belem makes a great version, by far the best I tried. They were so delicious I managed 12 in one day!
The Bacalhau meanwhile is a very popular ingredient in Portuguese cooking. It’s delicious and quite different from anything you will have tried elsewhere. And don’t skimp on the other kinds of seafood, which is such a key part of Portuguese cuisine — try the grilled salmon, for example.
Pro tip: Go to Casa Portuguesa do Pastel de Bacalhau in the famous Rua Augusta and try a special twist on Bacalhau. This place mixes the traditional flavors in a cod cake filled with Serra da Estrela cheese — a match made in heaven!
Lisbon has its own genre of music, Fado, which is like blues with a touch of folk, and more sadness. If you look online you will find a lot of “Fado houses” recommended by various travel guides to Lisbon, but these are all quite pricey, touristy places.
If you want an authentic experience, just go to Alfama district around 9 to 10 pm, wander through the streets, and check out the small local bars. You will often find places that host non-famous but beautiful Fado singers. Get a drink or a light dinner and enjoy an authentic Portuguese night — one of the best experiences I had in Lisbon.
If you open any Lisbon travel guide, you’ll always find this tip: ride tram №28. The reason is that this tram’s route passes through very interesting, scenic districts of Lisbon, including Baixa, Graça, Alfama, and Estrela.
And the tram itself is old and historical and looks beautiful to ride. But this has become a very touristic attraction and it’s literally full of pickpockets.
Tram 12 because the famous Tram 28 is a tourist trap. (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
So be smart and instead ride tram №12, just beside it. It goes to most of the same places and will provide you with a better experience.
Pro tip: Don’t take the full trip; ride the tram until you arrive at Se Cathedral and hop off. You are now on the top of the hill in the Alfama district. The cathedral is worth seeing and a couple of steps beside it is Santa Luiza Miradouro, a perfect place to watch the sunset, after which you can head to the city center on foot — a beautiful and easy walk.
The view from Santa Luiza Miradouro, one of many beautiful viewpoints on top of the hills in Lisbon (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Lisbon is spread over seven hills. The tops of these hills provide a wonderful opportunity to view the city. These panoramic viewpoints are called miradoras in Portuguese and there are many of them. It’s a free way to view the city’s beauty. Watch a sunset or a sunrise from a miradouro and I promise you it will be something you will never forget.
Above I mentioned the Santa Luiza Miradouro (a personal favorite). But you can also try the Praça Alegria Miradouro (reached from Praça dos Restauradores by the traditional Funicular Gloria), which provides views over Baixa, leading towards the Rio Tejo.
Castelo de Sao Jorge Miradouro is also nice, although don’t bother with the Castle Sao Jorge next door — it’s a waste of time. But this miradouro is on top of the highest hill in Lisbon, so the view is beautiful.
Shopping is a real pleasure here at Centro Colombo, the most famous shopping mall in Lisbon (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Lisbon is a very good clothes shopping destination in Europe, with seriously good prices!
The best place for a shopping spree is Columbus mall; I got a beautiful coat and a pair of jeans for 33 euros this December (650 EGP!).
Pro tip: One word: PRIMARK
There are a lot of amazing day trips that you can do from Lisbon, taking a train from Rossio train station (which is a beautiful thing to see even if you are not traveling!). But if you will do just one, then without a doubt it should be the beautiful city of Sintra.
The beautiful Sintra, a close-by city and a recommended day trip from Lisbon (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Sintra is a historic city over the hills, full of old beautiful palaces and a grand Moorish castle that is worth seeing. The city’s central streets are made of cobblestones and the whole architectural style is colorful and beautiful.
Pro tip: when you arrive by train, exit on the right and wait for the tourist public bus 434 (5 euros); it will take you on a one-way circular ride around the three most important landmarks of Sintra (the town, the Moorish castle on the hill, and the Pena Palace). You can ride and hop on/off any bus until you make a full circle back to the train station. The castle is highly recommended!

It’s easy to make it seem like everything in Lisbon is perfect, but like anywhere else on earth, Portugal has its ups and downs. On the eve of my first full calendar year here, I wanted to share some negatives about life in Lisbon that don’t often get brought up by freshly-minted immigrants.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment for me was learning that it’s very difficult to reach the rest of Europe’s rail network from Portugal. It’s not impossible, but it involves switching trains several times and the entire journey takes almost twice as long as it would take by car. Within Portugal, most of the line is on slow-rolling commuter trains, and you only hit high-speed rail once you reach the Spanish city of Badajoz. As an American, I sort of took for granted that everywhere in Europe was well-connected by train, so I did very little research in this area only to be disappointed by Portugal’s lack of integration into the rest of the continent’s high speed rail networks.
Even getting to Spain’s capital, Madrid, is no easy feat. It used to be possible to go to sleep in Lisbon and wake up refreshed in Madrid on a sleeper train. Prior to the pandemic there was an overnight sleeper train that regularly ran between Lisbon and Madrid but it hasn’t been in operation since 2021. Thankfully, there is now talk of bringing it back. There is also talk of increasing the speed of the lines between Lisbon and Madrid by refurbishing a section of the line on the Portuguese side that’s not currently suited to high speed travel. But it’s hard to imagine a rejuvenation and refurbishment of train lines being very quick, so it’s anyone’s guess as to when we might expect it.
Once you reach a major Spanish city you can fairly easily get to Paris and from Paris on to the rest of Europe, but getting to Madrid or Barcelona as a primary objective is the difficult part. Hopefully within the next few years we will have both faster, and overnight, routes between the peninsula’s major cities.
Lisbon is famous for its white and black cobblestone pathways. In the tourist areas of the city — like Chiado-Baixo — these pathways are wide and pedestrian traffic is prioritized. Elsewhere in the city, though, sidewalks can be very narrow and impossible for two people to walk abreast. This is expected in a city as old as Lisbon where it would take moving entire city blocks to widen sidewalks.
The center of my neighborhood has plenty of wide sidewalks for walking, but in the area where I live the sidewalks are narrow. Couple this with a 7-year old and cars that are frequently driving way too fast and it’s a recipe for anxiety. Even where the sidewalks are wide, it’s not unusual to see people pull their vehicles completely up on the sidewalk. While I can normally walk around them, it is almost certainly a huge challenge for the elderly and disabled.
I’ve even seen people park perpendicular to a street corner, with the ass-end of their car out in an intersection while they run into a store. This seems pretty common with the over 60 crowd, but it’s usually disregarded and nobody says anything. This seems to just be normal life in Lisbon.
And if you do own a car here, you can expect to pay out the ass for parking. People in large American cities will be familiar with this, but those of us from the burbs are accustomed to free parking everywhere. Street parking does exist, but it seems to require a lot of effort to find a spot. Personally, I’m a fan of Lisbon’s attempts to reclaim streets for pedestrians and reduce the amount of cars on its congested streets.
And here’s one final thing you should know — the highways throughout Portugal are full of toll roads and automated speed traps. We rented a car for a recent trip to Fundão and I racked up about €60 in speeding fines while going about 8km over the posted speed limit. I knew we should have taken the train!
When I was told that winters in Lisbon were wet and cold I sort of glossed over that detail. How cold could it really be?
The answer is that it gets pretty fucking cold and wet in Lisbon. The rain begins in October and doesn’t stop until late November. After a brief pause for the holidays, it begins again in the spring. Of course, climate change is creating some variations in this pattern based on what I hear from folks who have spent their entire lives here, but this winter has certainly met expectations. This is not the kind of cold like, say, Toronto or Cleveland or even Atlanta. Temperatures this winter haven't dipped below 37F so far, and most days are much more mild coming in somewhere between 45F-55F. But the combination of cold and wet creates this ongoing chilliness in the house that we use central heating systems to eliminate in the United States.
I’ve only lived in a single apartment since we moved here, so my experience with housing is pretty limited. I think we managed to lease a pretty nice apartment with modern amenities. But it seems that most buildings’ walls are concrete, which doesn’t provide very good insulation. And of course central heating is unheard of outside of newly-constructed homes in suburban developments. If you get good sun, as our apartment does, things warm up during the day in exterior rooms, but nights and mornings can be downright chilly.
You also need to open windows periodically to air the house out, otherwise it becomes stuffy and stale. In winter this is challenging because of the cold and rain. Cross-breezes are great in the summer but bone-chilling in winter and the dampness permeates your house, keeping clothes from drying and creating excellent conditions for mold. So you wind up with this twofold problem in the fall and winter: you need to open the windows, but it lets the cold and dampness in.
Last year due to the problem with drying clothes, we bought a dryer. This year, due to the presence of mold in our bathroom, we bought a dehumidifier. Take people at their word when they say Lisbon gets cold.
Speaking of airing out the house, the air quality outside is not always great and is worsened by passing cars. Occasionally, it’s even worse off when there is a wildfire near Lisbon, which happens a lot now during the dry summers.
We’re among other US families and friends that have noticed an uptick in respiratory infections and I was told by a friend from the US that has lived in Lisbon a few years longer than us that respiratory illnesses are common in Lisbon, especially among kids. Lisbon is a port city, a major tourist destination, and as a very old city, suffers from lots of dust and mold which find their way into the air when disturbed.
We're on the first floor (which is what we'd refer to as the 2nd floor in the US) and with our windows open we get kind of dirty air from outside passing through the house if we don't have the cross-breeze going in the opposite direction. A good breeze can help keep the combination of dust, mold, and car exhaust moving, but if the air is still it wafts into the house. Cigarette smoke is common too, and definitely factors into the equation if you spend any amount of time at quiosques or patios.
We have a 7 year old and so we're not always sure what's normal during cold season for kids her age. Not to mention that she came of age during the peak of the pandemic where masking was common and we have now largely abandoned that practice unless we ourselves are sick and going out in public. My grandmother would have said ""she's got the crud,"" and I think that's mostly it. But during our first year in Lisbon we had ""the crud"" frequently, though so far this year it has been noticeably better.
We are also regularly among crowds of other people: on the metro, the bus, or just walking through the mercado. These situations obviously present opportunities to transmit airborne illnesses, whereas in the United States prior to the pandemic it was very rare that we were in crowded spaces with other people. This doesn't really seem like a coincidence.
There's a lot going on here, including the fact that I have had asthma since I was about my daughter's age. Unfortunately, maybe that's going to be true of her as well. If there is a positive spin I can put on this issue, it's that Ventolin inhalers can be acquired here without a prescription (I read this somewhere online, tried it for myself, and found it to be true!) and the cost of my daily asthma medication is something like €30 a month (compared to closer to $120 a month back home).
We’re still happy here, and we think the drawbacks of living in Lisbon are outweighed by the benefits to our life, which I talk about in other articles. There are other minor challenges and things we don’t like, which would be true of anywhere we lived. Things like:
These things don’t amount to a hill of beans, however, when we think about how happy we are to be here and about all the other things we love about being in Lisbon. And if we’d known about these things before moving here, we still would have come. A big part of our relocation to Portugal was to consciously become more adaptable and make changes in our lives in order to thrive in a new community. And while we knew things like climate control would be challenging, we have already started to acclimate to the changes. We have dealt with both heat and cold better than we did during our first year, and we anticipate that this will only improve the longer we’re here.
I know we’ll find more things that rub us the wrong way the longer we stay here, but our first year and a half here has also taught us that we are adaptable — that we can still change and reinvent ourselves, and that there are also new and exciting things to love spread out around this small-but-beautiful country.

This story is about how a one encounter can change everything and how Lisbon can tell you everything if you can listen
Recently we were walking around the city with my friend and he asked me,
— Does the city respond to you? It got me thinking.
If you think of a city as a separate civilization, any city responds to me. Perhaps because I am a historian and I love life, comfortable shoes, walking at least 10 thousand steps a day and have endless curiosity. For me, a city is about life. Some look at a city as a geographical object, others as an investment, a source of income, beauty, history or just a backdrop. I look at the city as a separate civilization. On the other hand, there is a city and there is a village. In the village, life is organized differently. In the village, in my opinion, not much happens. All life is concentrated in the city — championships, concerts, forums, summits, museums, galleries, meetings, marches, etc. Open any news and all the news is about city life. The city is about life. And who is interested in other people’s life? A person is either not interested in it, or he looks at it from the outside, half-heartedly. He’s busy with his own life. For example, can you describe the street where you go to work every day and tell another person about it in such a way that he wants to live on this street? Can you convey your interest in life to another person? Apparently, when we say that this city responds or doesn’t respond to me, we don’t mean the facades of the houses. We’re talking about how the life of the city coincides with our own idea of life. Or it doesn’t. And then it seems like a foreign city.
Cities like people.
First encounter with Lisbon
It wasn’t love at first sight. But it was love. For Lisbon or for Bruno or for Lisbon through love for Bruno. It doesn’t matter anymore. It’s love. I think of Bruno so often that I sometimes think I made him up. Maybe I did. No there really is a guy named Bruno, who showed up at a moment when I felt like there was no way we matched up with Lisbon. He showed up and opened my eyes to this city. No, he wasn’t my city guide, but he looked and kissed me in a way that made me want to live in this city. No, Bruno and I aren’t a couple, he’s still in my memories, and what’s more, I don’t think he even realizes the Important role he played in my life. But my story with Lisbon will always begin with that encounter.
Lisbon responded to me
The day after meeting Bruno, I went for a walk with a completely different mood and found myself in Rossio Square. I took a 360 degree look around and realized that from this point I could see all of Portugal’s history.
Did you know that you can see the history of the country by standing in this very square and you don’t even have to move anywhere? Don’t believe me? Now you will 😊
Medieval Ages
Look up the hill to the east to see St. George’s Castle, one of the oldest buildings in Lisbon. This is where Portugal’s history as a kingdom begins. Having survived the Romans and Visigoths, the Iberian Peninsula was subjected to a new invasion. In 711 Muslims came to its territory — they were called Moors. The beginning of Portugal’s own independent history is associated with the name of Afonso I Henriques, nicknamed the Conqueror. Personality has significance in history. Thanks to Afonso I the territory of the country increased many times. But the most valuable trophy of Afonso I was undoubtedly Lisbon, which after cruel battles in 1147 became part of Portugal and turned into one of the largest centers of the country, and in 1255 the capital from Coimbra was moved to Lisbon.
Not far from Rossio Square there is Martin Muniz Square, who fought bravely during the siege of Lisbon, he alone attacked the gates of the fortress and defended them without letting them close, sacrificing his life. Thanks to Martin Muniz’s feat, the attacking Christian soldiers were able to approach the open gate and capture the fortress.
It is on this square that the famous 28th tram stops, which will take you to St. George’s Castle. Of course, you can also climb the hill on foot and get confused in the maze of streets of Alfama. It is from here that the city began to grow, descending down the hill to the banks of the Tagus River.
If you turn to the west, you will see the Gothic arches of the ruins of the Karmu Monastery. It was once one of the largest churches in the city. The history of the monastery began in 1385, when before the decisive battle of Aljubarrota, King João I of Avis and his magnificent commander-in-chief of the Portuguese army, 25-year-old Nuno Alvares Pereira, made a vow: in the event of victory over the Castilians, each would build a monastery in honor of Our Lady. To commemorate the victory and in fulfillment of the vow made before the battle, João I founded the monastery of Batalha, and Nuno Alvares Pereira in 1389 founded a monastery of the Carmelite order in Lisbon, known as the “Church of Carmo”. Where he later donated all his considerable fortune, and then took monastic tonsure. Pious Nuno lived in the monastery until the end of his days. The hero of the battle Nuno Alvares Pereira deservedly got his place on the arch in the main square Praça do Comércio.
The Carmelite Monastery was to become one of the most beautiful monuments of the National Gothic, but a tragic fate awaited it. On November 1, 1755, the vaults of the church could not withstand the strong earth tremors and collapsed, burying the townspeople who came to mass under them and losing forever the tomb of Connetabile Nuno, whom the Vatican canonized recently in 2009. The Battle of Aljubarrota, in which Portuguese troops defeated the Castilian army, laid the foundations for the Age of Discovery.
The Age of the Great Discovery was a golden age for Portugal, the XV-XVI centuries
Take a look at the square beneath your feet: the wave-shaped mosaic is no accident. It is a symbol of the ocean, of the sea voyages that made Portugal a great empire. Portugal opened the world to the world and discovered itself. The age of the Great Discovery was a golden age for Portugal, the XV-XVI centuries were a time of unprecedented Portuguese greatness, it was a wonderful time of selfless and courageous navigators heroes.
Breathe in the air. Can you smell it?
The most incredible smell I’ve ever smelled is the smell of jacaranda. Lisbon’s lilac tree, Jacaranda mimosifolia, is truly worthy of the royal court. Jacaranda came from Brazil, bringing with it the scent of honey, grapes and the Atlantic Ocean. Brazil was a colony of Portugal, and Rio de Janeiro even served as the capital of the empire for 13 years, because of the invasion of Napoleon’s army under the command of General Junot the royal house had to move to Brazil in 1807. It is a unique fact in history that the capital of an empire becomes its overseas colony.
In fact, the official name of the square is Pedro IV Square. In the center of the square you can see a monument to the King of Portugal and the first emperor of Brazil.
Rossio Square now looks smart and peaceful. And once the fires of the Inquisition were burning here, heretics and witches were burned on the place of today’s national theater of Queen Mary stood the palace of the Inquisition and people always gathered to watch this spectacle. The first autodafa took place here in 1540.
Slowly, the former greatness of the Portuguese Empire fades away and in 1580. Portgugal fell under Spanish rule for 60 years. In 1640 there is a rebellion in Lisbon, as a result of which the independence of Portugal was restored. And if we walk a little from Rossio Square past the magnificent train station, we will see the Monumento dos Restauradores.
In 1755 Lisbon was destroyed by a terrible earthquake.
Take a look around — this is Lisbon Pombal. Lisbon rebuilt after the earthquake. a great city reborn after a great catastrophe. At least, that was the original intention of Marquis Sebastião José Pombalho, who was appointed by King José I to lead the rebuilding of Lisbon after the devastating earthquake of 1755 and who created the so-called Pombaline style. One of the most characteristic features of the Pombalino style is its desire for order and will to live, which can be traced back to people’s desire to protect themselves from the destructive elements. If in Alfama it is very easy to get lost in its chaotic winding streets, then in the lower new Lisbon it is impossible to do so — the city is built on a plan, clearly on a line. The task before the architects was difficult — it was necessary not only to rebuild a part of the country, but also to make the buildings stronger and more resistant to seismic activity. Pombalino style is very visible on the streets of the city — strict rectangular shapes of buildings, the exterior of buildings is simple, standard and laconic.
Breathe in again. What do you smell this time?
It’s the smell of coffee and the roaring 1920s. I was sitting in Café Nicola, where the bohemians of Lisbon drank coffee. Did you know that Portugal is a coffee fanatic country. According to the Potrugal Coffee Association (Associação Industrial e Comercial do Café https://aicc.pt/) 80% of Portuguese people can’t imagine their lives without coffee, while the rest don’t drink it. Remember the phrase: “Um café e um pastel de nata, por favor” and you won’t be lost. A vida só começa depois de um café — life begins only after coffee. I don’t know who this phrase belongs to, but I’m sure he was Portuguese. By the way, definitely those 20% are lying.
The 20th century is a turbulent time.
As I stood in Rossio Square I remembered that it was here in 1974 that thousands of people gathered to celebrate the fall of the dictatorship. On April 25, 1974, a bloodless military revolution took place in Portugal. Soldiers, tired of colonial wars and censorship, overthrew the authoritarian regime. In the streets, women and children came up to them, put carnations in the barrels of their rifles — and they did not shoot. Red carnations became a symbol of freedom and in Portugal you look at them in a special way. This event has become a symbol of hope for all of Europe.
Here in Lisbon, in Rossio Square, on Avenida da Liberdade, at the walls of Carmo, the dreams of freedom have become a reality. And I want to remember that revolutions are not always accompanied by weapons. Sometimes it’s just flowers and music. And that’s the lesson of Lisbon.
And that’s not all that Rossio Square has to tell us.
The city responded to me. It was in this city that I first experienced how deeply a place can speak if you know how to listen to it. Here, in Rossio Square, another Portugal opened up before me.
If you have walked around Rossio Square too, tell what you felt. Maybe this place opened up an unexpected side of Portugal for you?
I want to work in Lisbon as a tour guide. I want to tell the guests of the city about the history of the country, which has given the world so many wonderful discoveries and not only geographical discoveries and many lessons.
That’s my dream.And dreams are supposed to come true.

Posted: 6/26/2003 | June 23rd, 2023
Lisbon is one of my favorite cities in the world. It’s home to impressive museums, historic buildings, picturesque plazas, chilled-out cafes, and a lively mix of clubs and candlelit music venues where people go to listen to traditional fado music. I fell in love with the city as soon as I arrived — and it was even better the second time!
Today, Lisbon is one of the most popular cities on the continent. From cruisers to digital nomads, everyone loves this sunny city. I’ve visited a few times over the years and always look forward to going back. The warm weather, inviting colors, and laid-back vibe really make people feel welcome.
The best way to see the city, though (especially if it’s your first time) is to take a walking tour. It’s the first thing I do when I visit a new city as it’s the best way to connect with a local guide, get insider info, and see the main sights.
These days, there are a ton of walking tours available to ensure you make the most of your visit. Here’s a list of my favorites — from free tours to food tours to pub crawls — to help you sort through it all so you just end up with the best!
Best Overall Tour
Learn More
I’ve taken Walks tours all over Europe and it is, by far, my favorite tour company. They always manage to go above and beyond with tours that are both fun and educational.
In Lisbon, they offer a few tours (including food tours) but for a good primer on the city I recommend their Lisbon in a Day tour. It includes a river cruise, early access to Jeronimos Monastery, and lunch. It lasts a full day too!
Best Free Tour
Learn More
This informative three-hour free tour takes you through five of Lisbon’s most popular neighborhoods — Graça, Alfama, Baixa, Chiado, and Bairro Alto — offering up an entertaining and enlightening dose of history and culture along the way.
The tours also focus on a more local side of Lisbon. If you’re on a budget and want an introduction to the city, this is the tour for you. Just remember to tip the guide!
Here are a few more walking tour options to help you make the most of your time in Lisbon:
Devour started in Spain and quickly began doing tours in Lisbon. They offer a food and fado tour, mixing two cultural highlights of Lisbon on one tour. I personally like the Tastes & Traditions food tour they do: you stop at seven small businesses in Lisbon, eating up to nine samples and sipping three different types of beverages. Devour is one of the best food tour companies in Europe and their Lisbon tours are no exception.
Tours start at 95 EUR.
Book here!
This tour company offers a whole range of tours but their Best of Lisbon introductory tour is perfect for both first-time Lisbon visitors and budget travelers. The three-hour tour starts at 9:30am and takes you through some of the city’s main neighborhoods, making a stop for wine and a bite of the famous pastry, pastel de nata (an egg custard tart). The group tours max out at 14 people.
Tours start at 18 EUR.
Book here!
Street art has taken over the world’s big cities, including Lisbon. On this three-hour tour, you’ll see some of the best works in the city and learn about the social and political motives behind them. Tours are led by a local street artist too, so you’ll really get an insider’s look at the scene and visit murals most other tours skip.
Tours start at 35 EUR.
Book here!
Pancho does tours all over the Iberian Peninsula, using local guides and crafting itineraries that focus on street art, tapas and wine, and day trips to places like Sintra. Personally, I like their fado music tour. During the 2.5-hour tour, you’ll learn everything there is about this melancholic music that’s endemic to Portugal. You’ll get a front-row seat at a fado show in the center of Lisbon at the end.
Tours start at around 40 EUR.
Book here!
Overtourism is a problem in many cities, particularly in Europe, with crowds of people ping-ponging from one attraction to the next. Hence, the idea behind We Hate Tourism Tours: the 3.5-hour walking tour takes you to some way off-the-radar neighborhoods to show you how the people of Lisbon really live. There are only about six people per tour, which keeps things intimate. It also means you should book in advance as tours sell out fast. I love how they are getting people out of the main touristy areas and showing you a real look at Lisbon life. I can’t recommend this tour enough.
Tours start at 40 EUR.
Book here!
Lisbon has a very lively nightlife these days and, if you’re looking for a way to see it while also meeting other travelers, the classic pub crawl is a good way to go. This tour takes you to three spots, with a free shot at the first and the third stop. Plus, there’s a one-hour period of all-you-can-drink cider or sangria. It’s a great option for solo travelers looking to meet other people. It’s not a real “local” thing but it’s fun!
Tours start at 20 EUR.
Book here!
***
Lisbon has walking tours for just about every interest and budget, which is one of the many reasons I love the city. Whenever I visit, I always take a tour or two because the city just has so much to see and do, and the local guides always add a ton of value to my trip. These tours allow you to get an inside perspective on life here and ask locals questions on where to go, what to do, and how to act. Be sure to take at least one of these tours while you are in the city.
My detailed, 200+ page guidebook is made for budget travelers like you! It gets straight to the practical information you need to save money while backpacking around Europe. You’ll find suggested itineraries, budgets, ways to save money, on and off the beaten path things to see and do, non-touristy restaurants, markets, and bars, and more! Click here to learn more and get started!
Book Your Flight Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. They are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. Two of my favorite places to stay are:
If you’re looking for more places to stay, here is a complete list of my favorite hostels in Lisbon.
Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:

Stories from Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking lands and cultures

Recently I received a call from an Asian friend, who also happens to be a former colleague. He was embarking on a maiden trip to Lisbon, and wanted me to help him formulate a list of things to do.
I’ve been to Portugal’s capital city so many times that I have got bored with it. In fact, these days when I plan a trip to the Iberian nation, I prefer to skip the capital altogether.
Having said that, even though a typically touristy exercise, it was nonetheless my friend’s first trip to Lisbon. As such, I wanted to help him in every way I could, hoping to contribute as much information as was possible. In any case, his list of questions was palpably a long one.
Frankly speaking, Portugal’s capital has quite a few iconic monuments and tourist attractions. On the contrary, a lot of options mean someone who is visiting the city for the first time would struggle to make decisions.
It was a matter of time before his itinerary became increasingly elaborate. Based on suggestions, including that of yours truly, he had included Arco da Rua Augusta (Rua Augusta Arch), Avenida da Liberdade (Avenue of Liberty), Baixa Pombalina (Downtown), Mosteiro dos Jerónimos (the Jerónimos Monastery or…

Lisbon,https://medium.com/explore-everyday/tagged/lisbon,"So much to say about these past days in Lisbon, Portugal. I can’t really claim to have discovered this city properly or put enough effort into understanding the Portuguese culture and for this I am placing the blame squarely on the city’s ability to party.
Dear You:
Home is such a faraway place now — across the ocean and 13 hours back, with your body strapped in place and the monitor throwing light onto your lap. You cannot sleep. Blue butterflies trail down Cinderella’s ball gown, and Taylor Swift…
We spent two nights in Lisbon as part of our 5 night trip to Portugal for the March Easter weekend. Getting from Sintra to Lisbon was pretty easy although we did have some confusion when getting a ticket from the machine — it’s probably better to head into the main train station and buy a ticket from there.
When people talk about Chapitô, the first image that usually comes to their mind is the stunning view of Lisbon they get from the terrasse of the restaurant, Chapitô à Mesa. But the project of Chapitô goes beyond the simple borders of its restaurant: Chapitô reunites…

I love the bustle of Lisbon: the up-and-down streets, the beauty of the multicolored azulejos façades on the buildings, the decorated cobblestone streets and sidewalks, and even the grittiness of the poorer neighbourhoods. But sometimes you want a break, a place without busy-ness, without touristy-ness. A place where you can feel calm and reflective for few hours. I discovered such a place in Estrela Park, a few blocks from the gleaming and grand Portuguese Parliament Buildings, and just opposite the Basilica da Estrela.
In contrast to these grand and gleaming buildings, Estrela Park feels intimate and a bit wild. Its main features are the exotic plants and trees from around the world that grow tall and lush within its gates. The park was designed in 1842 as a place for the working classes of Lisbon to relax and forget the toil and the stress of city living. Ironically, funding for construction dried up due to political instability, and the park was not completed until thirty years later. This was a tumultuous time for Portugal, as the nation veered precariously and at times violently between monarchists and republicans.
The tranquil green spaces are punctuated by several beautiful stone statues. It occurred to me that this juxtaposition between art and nature, white and green, would be worth a photo essay, showing the statues at a distance, half-hidden by the foliage, and then up close, where the depth of their expressiveness is unconcealed. But then, as I learned the stories behind these statues they revealed themselves to be much more than decorative. I’m presenting them in the order I came across them as I explored the park (and with gratitude to this Wordpress article, which helped me fill in the blanks about their origins):
The King’s Daughter, Guardian of the Ducks
She stands amid the rushes in the center of a pond, carrying a bundle of straw or something; a gaggle of stone ducks flocks around her feet. Up close, the naturalistic Art Nouveau style of the sculpture shows her in motion, walking along, yet looking down with care and affection at the ducks she guards. But wait: why would anyone guard ducks?
I discovered online that the statue was inspired by the Norwegian fairy tale of the same name, which I had never before heard of. The ducks, it turns out, are actually the 12 brothers of the princess. They had been enchanted by an evil witch. The princess risked her own life to break the spell, which could only be done by weaving each brother a shirt from thistledown (that’s what she carries in her arms). The down had to be harvested by moonlight in the moor of the trolls. It’s a harrowing tale of courage and deception, well worth reading.
Statue of João de Deus
João de Deus was a famous Portuguese poet, educator and politician of the 19th century, known for his personal rigor and political independence — he never joined a political party. I first spied him behind the wrought-iron fence of the bandstand, beneath a flowering jacaranda tree. I was struck by the upright posture of this diminutive man, whose large head makes his body seem quite short. He seems both humble and strangely dignified. The school just next to the park bears his name.
Wikipedia says this about him: Next to Camões and perhaps Almeida Garrett, no Portuguese poet has been more widely read, more profoundly admired than João de Deus; yet no poet in any country has been more indifferent to public opinion and more deliberately careless of personal fame…
Oh my! He sounds like a man with the heart of a flanêur!
The Digger
This statue of a farmer tilling the soil with a hoe was erected in 1913 — the first statue added to the garden after the monarchy was abolished and Portugal became a republic in 1910. Framed behind a spreading banyan tree, the sculpture seems a fitting public expression to mark the political transition. Notice how clearly the man’s rough clothing and strong arms are depicted.
But that look in his eyes — it’s not that of a victorious peasant embracing his nation’s freedom, is it? To me, he is looking up anxiously, almost fearfully. Perhaps he symbolizes the entire nation, still working hard just to survive, gazing towards an uncertain future of the 20th Century. Would the eyes of a similar statue created in Portugal in 2022 look much different?
The Awakening, or Laziness
This 1915 statue of a naked young woman arising in the morning is said to be the most popular in the park. It’s easy to see why. From a distance, under an umbrella tree, her white figure is eye-catchingly sensuous.
Up close, though, it is the expression on her face that makes her so utterly beguiling — that satisfied, languorous smile, those half-opened eyes! Though one of her arms is missing, the other is clearly in the middle of a stretch. I love the two very different words the woman supposedly embodies: Awakening and Laziness. Is she rising to meet the day, awakening to the possibilities and hopes of her future — much as the young republic was awakening? Or has she already risen too late to do anything productive with her youthful energy? It’s hard not to think about her fellow statue, the Digger, not 50 meters away, who has been toiling away, probably since dawn.
Statue of Antero de Quental
Antero de Quental was a 19th Century realist poet and political philosopher, but his statue is the last edition to the park. It was installed in this private grove of ivy-covered trees in 1951. It makes me laugh to see a “realist” poet dressed in the robes of an ancient Roman! I hope he has a good sense of humor in whatever immortal realm of the poets he resides.
As a young poet, de Quental declared the role of poets, in an era of great transformation, was to be messengers of the day’s great ideological questions. He emerged as a socialist, advocate of the proletariat, and eventually an anarchist. To me it’s surprising his defiant-seeming statue was installed in the midst of Portugal’s repressive Salazar dictatorship.
Wikipedia has this to say about the great poet, and the sad ending of his life: Throughout his life, de Quental oscillated between pessimism and depression; afflicted with what might have been bipolar disorder…he committed suicide by two gunshots to the stomach while seated on a bench in a local garden park. He died approximately an hour later. “Of all things, the worst is having been born,” he wrote in a poem.
Allegory (Man with a Dog)
This final statue I encountered reclines at the edge of another little lake in the park, and has an “unknown provenance.” Seen below, shrouded behind palm trees, it features a man in a robe with wild curly hair and a long beard that appears blown back as he leans slightly into an invisible strong wind. His large, powerful hands hold protectively onto his little dog. Its lips form a wide “O” because its mouth is also the spout of a fountain.
There is something loveable about this sculpture. I suppose it is the forcefulness of the man juxtaposed with the gentle way he holds his companion. It made me smile and think of all the old men and women I’ve seen in Lisbon, even in Estrela Park, out walking their little dogs.
The future might be wild and uncertain, but we can do the best we can to take care of the ones we love, whether dogs or ducks or a whole nation, even a continent, once again in the midst of turbulent times and perhaps a great transformation.

Ah, Lisbon. The “it” destination of every travel influencer who’s already exhausted Paris, Rome, and Barcelona. You know, that hidden gem where everyone and their grandmother is flocking to for its authentic charm? Yeah, that place.
Let me paint you a picture: sun-drenched streets, vibrant azulejos, and Fado music echoing from every corner. It all sounds like a dream, right? Until you’re elbow-to-elbow with a herd of selfie-stick-wielding tourists, paying €15 for a pastel de nata while being told it’s a steal. Lisbon is that friend who showed up late to the party, acts like they invented the party, and then charges you an entry fee to stay.
Remember when people said Lisbon was Europe’s best-kept secret, a cheap alternative to all those other overpriced cities? Ah yes, those were the days… like three years ago. Fast forward to today, and you’re casually dropping €200 a night for an Airbnb with a rustic view of the neighbor’s laundry hanging out to dry. Authentic, right? At least the Tuk-Tuksare cheap. Oh wait, no they’re not — get ready to sell a kidney for a 10-minute ride that smells like exhaust fumes and regret.
Oh, and about those locals everyone raves about meeting — good luck finding any. Lisbon is now a foreigner’s paradise, with expats and digital nomads who’ve all set up camp. You won’t meet many born-and-bred Lisboetas because they’ve been priced out of their own city and forced to the suburbs. It’s basically Lisbon: The International Edition. But sure, tell your friends you really connected with the local culture while chatting with other tourists over overpriced sangria.
What could make this urban utopia even better? How about a healthy dose of soul-crushing traffic. Lisbon has turned into a slow-moving parking lot. It’s ironic because for a city with hills so steep they should come with a life insurance policy, you’d think driving would be a breeze. Nope. It’s gridlock central, with honking horns, frustrated drivers, and narrow streets that could fit maybe one-and-a-half cars from the 1980s. So be prepared to sit back, relax, and enjoy the sounds of motorbikes revving while you take in the sights and smells of the city.
Speaking of smells…
If you’re looking for that special olfactory experience, Lisbon’s got you covered. Nothing says European sophisticationquite like walking down a street and being hit with the sweet perfume of sewage mixed with leftover sardines and an occasional whiff of diesel fumes. Add in the occasional garbage strike, and you’ve got a delightful sensory overload that really enhances the ambiance. Ah, the authenticity.
“Lisbon has the best seafood in the world!” they say, and sure, it’s great. If by “great” you mean paying €30 for a plate of sardines served with a side of Instagrammable lighting. Maybe you can hunt for one of those hidden, local tasquinhas, but here’s the reality: the moment you find one, congratulations! So has the rest of the internet. Prepare to pay tourist prices for what used to be a grandma’s Sunday lunch.
And speaking of pastel de nata (because everyone has to mention it, right?), after you’ve waited 45 minutes in line for the world’s best custard tart at Pastéis de Belém, you’ll realize something groundbreaking: it’s a tart. A good tart, but in the end, it’s 3 bites of egg custard. Revolutionary.
Love walking? Great, because you’ll be doing a lot of it. Lisbon is famous for its seven hills, which should really come with a fitness warning. Your calves will either be rock solid after day one or you’ll be crawling up to the nearest overpriced cafe to gasp for air and reconsider your life choices. Who needs a gym when you’ve got uneven cobblestone streets and inclines that rival the Tour de France?
Oh, and don’t think about wearing anything stylish. Those charming stone sidewalks will have you slipping and sliding into oblivion. Practical shoes or death — your call.
Lisbon is the land of boutique hotels and chic rooftop bars now. Need a cocktail with a view? You’re in luck — if you’ve got €15 to spare for something served in a mason jar with an edible flower garnish. Nothing screams “authentic Portuguese culture” quite like a trendy rooftop overlooking the real Lisbon down below, where locals used to afford rent.
Speaking of rent, just try talking to someone who’s lived in Lisbon for more than five years. They’ll tell you about the days when you could get a two-bedroom apartment for the price of a plate of Bacalhau à Brás. Now? Good luck finding anything that’s not being Airbnb-ed by some guy named Chad who’s “living his best life” while making a killing off your holiday budget.
Fado music is the soul of Lisbon, a haunting, melancholic soundtrack to the city’s history. That is, until you realize you’re paying €50 for a dinner-and-Fado experience where the servers sing in between handing you a glass of overpriced house wine. It’s like dinner theater but with extra saudade and a hefty bill.
If you love being part of a crowd of people who are all convinced they’ve discovered something new and edgy, Lisbon is for you. Sure, it’s beautiful, but so is that postcard of the Eiffel Tower you could’ve bought instead of spending €500 on a long weekend here. Between the hills, the prices, the awful traffic, the expat invasion, and the stench, Lisbon is Europe’s most over-hyped, over-exposed city. But hey, at least you’ll get a great Instagram post out of it. #LisbonGoals #LivingTheDream #SendHelp

Tried & tested recommendations from a diehard Lisbon lover.
Ah, Lisbon. With 4.5 million visitors per year, it’s one of the world’s leading tourist destinations—and a city that, for the past winter, I’ve been lucky to call home. Given that there are too many attractions worth seeing in this historic seaside capital, it was tough to pick favorites. But if you ever get a chance to explore, here are a few places you definitely shouldn’t miss.

If you look on Instagram, living abroad seems to be such an exciting, colourful, perfect experience. But more often than not, being an “immigrant” is much harder than it seems.
[Clarification, to me, you are not an “expat” until your company sends you to work abroad. If you choose to move in another country, you are an “immigrant”. Using the word “expat” only for temporary, rich and privileged (often Western) countries seems like a post-colonial term to me. We are all immigrants if we decide to live abroad.]
At the beginning everything is exciting and overwhelming at the same time. Then, you start feeling alone. You don’t speak the language. You’ve lost all the things that used to make you “you” before. Your little habits. It’s super hard to integrate.
There’s this saying that goes something like “the grass is greener in the neighbours’ garden”. Well, until you haven’t experienced it, I don’t think you can understand what it actually means.
After having lived in 5 different countries (France, Belgium, Hungary, Romania, Portugal), in 8 different cities, I can confidently say that there’s no such thing as one, perfect place that has it all. In the end it comes down to what you are looking for at a certain point in your life.
For example, some on the internet will have you believe that living in sunny Lisbon, Portugal is wonderful. It is, but few talk about the (very) low salaries locals have here and the struggle it is to make a living. How high the taxes are. The horror of bureaucracy. Or how expensive housing has become (same prices as in Paris!). How uncomfortable winters can be here, without central heating, proper isolation and as a result, mold infestation in the walls. How hard it is to make friends if you don’t speak the language. The list goes on.
I used to think that people in my home country (France) were all very negative. But then I met people who challenged my conception and I realised that you find negative people or even jerks, everywhere. Human beings tend to do this very funny thing called “projection” which is when someone projects his or her own perception onto something or someone else.
Generalising an experience is a dangerous exercise because in the end all experiences are very subjective and personal. Some will like living in “X” place, some will hate it. Don’t take everything you see or hear for the absolute truth. Challenge it. Ask yourself, would it make sense to me?
Also, the place you might hate could be paradise for someone else. Let’s keep an open mind about the reality of what life is actually like. Not in those “expats” bubbles or what “Instagram lifestyle gurus” preach.
Living abroad is fantastic, it’s also very hard. You grow a lot. You have to reinvent yourself, leave your comfort zone. It can also be very rewarding. You learn about yourself, about life, about letting go and adapting, about surviving. You might even start to appreciate some things you had “at home”.
Everyone should experience living abroad once in their life, if they have the opportunity to do so. Maybe if we did, we would be more tolerant and understanding of each other, more open, warm, welcoming… Maybe communities would actually flourish again. And the world would be a better place.

Hello readers!
I’ve always dreamt of being the traveler who writes her blog from a cozy coffee shop in the visiting town. That dream comes true as I bring you this post live from Lisbon, Portugal.
Sid and I couldn’t be happier since we touched down in Portugal. Visiting this vibrant country has been a long-standing wish, and we’re thrilled to be here finally. We are spending ten days exploring two incredible destinations: the vibrant capital city of Lisbon and the stunning volcanic island of Sao Miguel in the Azores.
In this blog post, I will share my experience in Lisbon.
I had doubts when Sid insisted on coming to Lisbon instead of Porto or Faro, as in my research, most travel blogs raved about these two as more popular and cultural cities to visit. But oh boy, how Lisbon grew on me.
I mean it is difficult not to fall in love with Lisbon. In addition to its energy, charm, and laid-back vibe, the city has so much to offer:
What more can a girl want? Well, Lisbon had a secret surprise for me.
By lucky happenstance, we visited Lisbon in the week of St Anthony’s Day, the biggest festival of the year for the city. This catapulted our experience 10x. Not only did we get to enjoy the festivities of June 12, but also we got to see the city in its full charm, bustling with street parties, food stalls, on-the-go cocktails, & colorful decorations throughout the five days.
The festival was undoubtedly a highlight, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have experienced such cultural immersion. Here are some special moments from our time joining the local festivities:
If you can, I will highly recommend planning your trip to the capital city of Portugal in June. But no sweat if you are unable to. Lisbon is a family-friendly and an all-year destination, so visit whenever you visit, you will have a great time.
Let me share more about what else made our Lisbon experience unforgettable.
Belem was our first stop in Lisbon. It’s full of attractions, so we purchased a 24-hour Lisboa card to avoid having to buy individual tickets at each site. This also helped us avoid queues which is a life savior as this location is frequented by many tourists. Almost everywhere there was a 30–45-minute queue to get tickets, so I will highly recommend buying yours in advance!
We started with the Belem Tower. It had beautiful stone architecture and was very picturesque thanks to being right by the water.
Besides that though, there wasn't much to do inside despite the hype. So if you are pressed for time, instead of waiting in line to go up the tower, I will recommend walking along the water to the Monument of the Discoveries, I enjoyed this walk much more than exploring Belem Tower from inside.
The Monument of Discoveries was a captivating work of art. It showcases 33 significant figures who played pivotal roles in Portugal’s overseas expansion. On this trip, I was fascinated to discover how much the Portuguese pride their international conquests in South America and Asia.
What truly captivated me about this monument were the intricate carvings of these figures. As someone who dabbles in pottery and finds it challenging to carve even in the forgiving medium of clay, I can only imagine the skill and precision required to achieve such detailed work in stone.
Speaking of carving, the real treasure was the Jerónimos Monastery — our next stop! While I was standing in the line to go in, I had many moments when I wanted to ditch it and move on to the next site as even Lisboa card didn't allow us to skip-the-queue here. But THANK GOD I did not.
The architecture inside the Monastery is breathtaking. I was constantly reaching for my phone, and even though the lighting was challenging, we managed a few great clicks.
There was also a church adjacent to the monastery, which was equally beautiful. I had a little deja vu of history class when I crossed Vasco Dd Gamma’s tomb, remembering reading about him as the man who found the sea route from Europe to India, ultimately leading to the Portuguese colonizing the Indian state of Goa.
Belem also has the iconic Pastéis de Belém, a popular bakery where the iconic custard tarts of Portugal are believed to have originated. It was so conveniently located next to the monastery, that we weren't even surprised that there was a long wait to get a table. It didn't matter as the weather was pleasant, we just grabbed our bites and enjoyed them in the nearby park — in true London fashion! 😉
After Belem, we returned to the city center. We decided to hike up to the Castle Sao Jorge via Alfama.
Alfama is Lisbon’s oldest and most enchanting neighborhood. And wandering through its narrow, winding streets here is one of my favorite memories from the trip. 😍
Second favorite memory is the pitstop at Portas do Sol. This viewpoint offers a much-needed breather after climbing the steep steps of Alfama. And the panoramic view is breathtaking! Another spot where I couldn't stop reaching for my phone and managed to get a few good clicks despite challenging lighting.
I came back to this multiple times during the trip and it was never enough time to soak in the beauty.
As we made our way to the castle, the views were even more spectacular from up there. The castle’s interior doesn’t hold much as most of it was destroyed in an earthquake, which was never reinstated. Fun fact: under the dictator's rule, this castle’s walls were restored to create a postcard-perfect image of Lisbon, leaving the insides in complete ruins.
I, however, thoroughly enjoyed exploring the interiors too. The battlements, the scenic staircase, peacocks strutting the castle grounds, and remains of the pottery used many years ago, made for a charming evening.
We also watched the sunset from the cozy little restaurant they had inside the castle walls. It was the perfect place to end the day and savor some summer drinks after a long fulfilling day.
Lisbon provides easy accessibility to the neighboring towns such as Sintra and Cascais. Both of which are less than an hour's train ride and cost under 10 euros back and forth.
For Sintra, we took the train from Rossio Station. Trains also run from Oriente station at a higher frequency but we opted for Rossio as that was within walking distance from our apartment and we wanted to get there as soon as possible to beat the crowd (which we couldn’t because yours truly likes her sleep😛).
The town was quite hilly, so while I was taking my time to hike around in my flowy dress, Sid, who grew up in the foothills of the Himalayas aka pahadi ladka, was feeling right at home and leading the way enthusiastically.
And for once, instead of Sid, I was remembering my childhood vacations in the hills — to Shimla and Mussoorie — the famous hill stations in India.
Our first stop was Quinta da Regaleira. This site is a mysterious estate with Gothic architecture, hidden tunnels, and lush gardens. Everything was so beautiful and well-maintained, that one can easily spend hours in this place.
The highlight was undoubtedly the famous Initiation Well, a spiral staircase that descends into the earth.
We enjoyed the experience of going down the stairs and it was also fun to explore the network of underground passages and caves it led to.
Our day was jam-packed as there were two more sites we wanted to see in Sintra. So we decided to have a quick lunch at the café within the estate. The soup at the cafe was one of the best soups I have had — 100% recommended.
We decided to make our way to Moors Cattle — our next destination — via a hike through Villa Sassetti. Now, here are some learnings:
It took us about 45 minutes to the Moorish Castle. Even though I was feeling tired, this site took my breath away. It was an ancient fortress that extended on two sides with long stone-walled towers on each. It was a complete contrast to Quinta da Regaleira but no less breathtaking. I had never seen anything like this before, so I was in awe. And despite my fear of heights, I climbed to the highest point of the castle and was rewarded with stunning views.
Can you tell from my photo that I was getting tired? Well, by the time we reached the iconic Pena Palace — I was in a mood 🥱
Sintra is often referred to as the magical town owing to this palace because it allegedly inspired Walt Disney to create the castle in Disney stories. Sadly, I wasn’t as impressed by the palace as I had hoped. Maybe it was the mix of exhaustion and crowds that turned me off. Because goes without saying that the palace was stunning. The intricate tile work and the rich contrast of deep red and yellow with the green-manicured gardens were truly impressive.
And roaming around the rooms gave an insight into how living in the bygone era of royalty and romance must have felt.
Kudos to Sid for keeping me going and capturing beautiful memories of lifetime despite my exhaustion.
After two days of intense exploring, Sid decided to catch up on work for the remaining days. It was a perfect excuse for me to start the morning slow.
The shot above is from our apartment in Lisbon. We stayed at the Sao Nicolau Townhouse by Ando Living. Ando Living is a collection of lifestyle-serviced apartments in Lisbon, Porto, and Istanbul. The apartment was spacious and beautifully decorated and we were welcomed with complimentary snacks and wine, which was a pleasant surprise and fun to relish on this balcony after a tiring day of city exploring.
We liked staying in the Baixa-Chidao area, it was a little touristy but the vibes and connectivity were excellent.
With easier access to Europe, Sid and I are embracing the concept of slow travel. This means staying longer at places we are visiting to truly soak in the local culture. Sid is splitting his time between exploring and working remotely. I am using the extra days to engage in local activities that otherwise I wouldn’t have the time for.
I was fortunate to try a few of these in Lisbon, and I will recommend these three:
After that, I decided to take a baking class for Pastéis de Nata. I am not a big chef, but I like to learn new skills, and cooking delicacies from different cuisines has always fascinated me. When we decided to move to London, I remember thinking this would be a good opportunity to build this skill. After all:
There are multiple baking classes available, but I decided to do the one with Homecooking Lisbon. It was highly rated and better priced. I think that’s because it was a little out of the touristy areas, but not too far, as I walked to LX Factory from there. I also saw a tram right outside so its pretty well connected.
The baking class turned out to be an incredible experience. Having never baked pastries before, I was nervous. But our instructor was so skilled and walked us through each step patiently. Honestly, I thought the tarts are pretty easy to bake at home, and I will definitely try.
I made a new friend in the class— a sweet girl from Australia with whom I was teamed up. I had a blast baking together and we couldnt stop giggling after she pointed to me that she found our instructor rather charming 🥰
I also met a lovely couple from New Zealand who had been saving for years to make this trip happen and were midway in their three-month-long Europe exploration, having covered South France and Spain before Portugal, and were headed to Greece and Italy after.
There was also this fun family from California. Both parents were proud chemical engineers, much to the embarrassment of their daughter, who had to keep reminding them that “This is a cooking class, not a science class!” 😄
And the best part was that we not only had a plate full of warm custards to try as a group, but was enough for everyone to take home — I was so excited for Sid to try!
2. Free Walking tour
Last but not least, I can’t not talk about the free walking tout I took on my last day in Lisbon. It was a fantastic way to meet a local guide and learn fun facts about the city that I had so thoroughly enjoyed.
Our tour guide was fantastic — she was fun, laid-back, and full of captivating stories about Portugal — good, bad or ugly — she narrated her anecdotes in an endearing way.
Did you know that Lisbon is older than Rome? Yep, it is the second oldest capital city in Europe, right after Athens. Despite being so ancient, it was ruled by numerous powers, including the Romans, Germans, Spanish, Greeks, and even the Moors. The Moors, in particular, left a lasting legacy with their beautiful tiles that adorn the city today.
Did you know the Portuguese are very proud of the overseas expansion? I mean, they did put up the Monument of Discoveries in Belem to celebrate that. I knew the Portuguese had invaded India and Brazil, but I didn’t know they had invaded China as well. In fact, I learned an interesting fun fact that oranges in the Mediterranean used to be bitter and green until the Portuguese found the sweet and reddish oranges in China, which they brought back to Europe for trade. They were such a hit that countries started naming the fruit after Portugal — Romania’s ‘portocale,’ Bulgaria and Turkey’s ‘portakal,’ and Greece’s ‘portokali’ all mean orange.
Our tour guide also shared about the time when Portugal crowned a bastard son as king of Portugal instead of making the daughter queen because she was married to the King of Spain. I mean, that makes sense, given the history of colonization. Interestingly though, the story has a Game of Thrones twist. The city’s bishop was against this coronation and in protest, he didn’t ring the bells of the famous Lisbon cathedral. Fatal mistake, as soon after he was thrown out of the top window (yes, the window you see in this picture) in front of the entire city and it was still considered an honest “battle mistake.”
“Well, that's a Portuguese sense of humor and easy-going vibe for all of you” — concluded our tour guide.
Well, she didn't just leave us there. She also took us to this special street called Rua De Saudade to familiarise us with “Saudade”, a unique Portuguese term that doesn’t translate into any other language, and encompasses a feeling of longing, melancholy, and nostalgia.
This is the other layer to the Portuguese soul she said — an undercurrent of melancholy.
3. Fado Live Music Show
This is also what their traditional Fado music beautifully encapsulates. We were fortunate to find a nice show to enoy this music. We had such a great time experiencing this despite the language barrier, it was a perfect way to end our stay in Lisbon.
On day 4, the sky cleared. Until now we had decent weather too, but it was slightly chilly for me, especially in the evening. Staying indoors would have been a shame on a perfect sunny day like that, so since Sid was busy , I hopped on a quick 40-minute train ride to explore the beach town of Cascais by myself.
It turned out to be the best decision! As soon as the train left the Lisbon station, I was welcomed by the sparkling blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean. I wasn’t expecting the entire train ride to be this coastal. And when I reached, right off the bat I could feel the beach air. The city was bustling with people, but in a relaxing and rejuvenating way. And the vibe was lively and infectious.
Before I retired to the beach, I did a short walk around the town to check out some places I read about in the self-guided walking tour I found online. You see, Cascais is that kind of town where there are beaches plus a lot of other things to see as well.
Cascais was also great for retail therapy. I mean, leave me alone and I don’t come back with shopping bags — ask Sid if that has ever happened 😛
No, but seriously, I found both quality and price better here in Cascais than in Lisbon. And if those beautiful colorful cork products don’t attract you — nothing will. I was so excited to taking these beautiful pieces home and remember my sweet trip by.
==============================================================
I’ll come back to Portugal for more history in Porto, more culture in Algrave, and more commerce in Alentejo. But for now — it is island time and up next is Sao Miguel, Azores. Stay tuned, the next post coming soon!

This blog post is the 4th article in the series. The collaboration between Dark Matter Labs and the Institute of Human Rights and Business (IHRB) has previously resulted in mapping of Copenhagen and Prague, and aims to continue its investigation further in Athens.
Through findings in this blog, we aim to flag the role of the state and city councils as active agents — alongside many others — shaping neoliberal development as opposed to the prevailing belief that solely the market forces may jeopardize spatial justice. The example of Lisbon shows that whereas transparent and accessible land ownership information is an important enabler for public oversight and policy, it is not the only key factor shaping a city’s ability to safeguard local livelihoods and affordability. This blog post expands on the thesis that land ownership patterns are foundational to spatial (in)justice, broadening the definition by encompassing the state- and city council-led regulatory mechanisms that govern property markets.
Lisbon is currently the 3rd most expensive city in Europe for rental accommodation. Given Portugal’s lower salary levels compared to other European member states, the recent penetration of vast amounts of foreign capital into the housing market has made everyday life increasingly unmanageable for its citizens.
Lisbon can be considered as a flagship example of the dynamics where the public debt of the European “semi-periphery” to the financial European and global market “core” (see: Lima, 2023) creditors turns the city into space for capital accumulation and its repayment. The public assets, municipal land, cultural heritage, housing, service sector and public space all become tools for economic growth often measured solely by abstract metrics such as real estate value appreciation.
Financialization means that even greater amounts of capital decoupled from the real economy and local realities (livelihoods, salaries etc.) flow into the city’s square meters turning them into financial assets that demand continuous returns on investments. In a context where finance is linked to space, new waves of capital need to continue finding physical room to act, with major impacts on people’s lives. The true debtors of this logic are not only the state or the municipality balance sheets, but the displaced citizens whose apartments needed to be freed for urban rehabilitation, struggling middle-class families facing soaring housing costs, the 22,812 families on the waiting list for social housing, and the young; future generations who might never afford a home, forced to live with their parents.
In Lisbon, state-aided deregulation of the rental market, commodification of the existing housing stock, land and new housing developments speculation are the forces that have shaped this condition. Based on existing research, this blog aims to explain these forces.
Due to a lack of data transparency, it is difficult to precisely assess and depict who owns land and properties in the city, as well as what are the historical transactions which could bring actors in power into the public eye. What is known, however, through qualitative interviews with leading housing justice researchers, is that the main factors that have been shaping the catastrophic housing affordability crisis in Lisbon are those known to many other cities in Europe.
The structure of the blog aims to guide the reader through the dynamics which led Lisbon to its current condition.
1. Role of the state — making ground for new capital
2. Large institutional investors & land ownership patterns
3. Data transparency review
4. Conclusion and recent developments
Neoliberalism involves preference for the extension of spontaneous (freed from state interference) competitiveness, market powers, and the belief in their ability to regulate economies efficiently. As it aims for a world where the state’s role is diminished, it paints a false picture of its passive role in the neoliberalisation of the economies. However, it’s precisely the state which, through a deliberate set of policies and regulations, provides the means through which the free market forces can spread their wings.
The case of Lisbon is exemplary, demonstrating that, in the context of property markets, instead of merely conforming to the free market doctrine, the state, and the municipal government chose to regulate in favour of the private sector to stimulate economic growth.
Against the backdrop of the 2008 financial crisis, the EU, Portuguese state, and Lisbon city government implemented, on the one hand, austerity measures resulting in the lowest public investment in housing in Europe, and on the other, multiple incentive mechanisms to attract foreign investment capital, aiming to repay the “Troika” loan, and re-stabilise the economy.
Neoliberalist logic moved Portugal away from its previous, more welfare-oriented system, creating a new state-craft infrastructure for market-oriented economic growth. Rather than being passive agents, the governing institutions actively retreated, creating room for the private market to rule.
To understand the reasons why Lisbon became so unaffordable, one needs to understand the set of historical events that turned the city, from being from a “high-risk” location, to a top investment destination in 2018 (the Emerging Trends in Real Estate European ranking, PwC & Urban Land Institute, 2018).
The developments which took place over two decades can be summarised as major trends of:
2. 1. Further financialisation of the housing stock through engagement of large- scale institutional investors
The first trend can be broken down further into three state-led and deliberate shaping mechanisms including:
Financing — Urban rehabilitation funding programmes that provided efficient financing infrastructure for renovations of the historical core
Deregulation — Simplification of urban rehabilitation rules
Liberalisation — Special tax incentives based on a desired economic turn towards commercial and tourist functions
Low taxation for EU citizens willing to relocate and invest
Incentives for wealthy transnationals willing to invest in the property market
o Liberalisation of the rental market through, among others,
The set of events shows that multiple incentives and deregulation rather than demand and supply issues led to the current unaffordability (see: Untaxed, Investigate Europe 2022).
The measures that led to the commodification of the historical core proved to be successful in terms of real estate investment returns. Following this first wave of investments, the perceived oversupply of luxury housing and scarcity of land for new large-scale investments in the central areas led institutional investors to bet on the peripheral plots of Lisbon’s metropolitan area.
A significant surge of almost 90% in building permits between 2017 and 2018 indicates this surge in large-scale investments, where substantial capital could be deployed. The adoption of a build-to-sell strategy ensured a secure exit option for institutional investors, who then facilitated the acquisition of ostensibly “affordable” housing from non-premium segments by smaller investors keen on subletting.
As highlighted by Lima, 2013, the narratives of the large investors shifted towards “long-term” investments targeting “the middle class”. Further narrative tools which the author points towards are:
Against the backdrop of liberalised rental laws, institutional investors drove the creation of a “new supply” of speculative rental apartment units extending beyond the historical core. This perpetuates the financialisation of housing, allowing the trend to proliferate and persist beyond the city centre.
The following illustration aims to capture the dynamics that led to Lisbon’s persisting unaffordability:
By complementing the great research of Lima, 2023 with our own investigations regarding land sizes, the following table shows the largest projects led by institutional investors in the Lisbon metropolitan area:
Link to the TABLE
Additionally the Map by Lima, 2023 shows locations of the projects.
Further research, including Lisbon’s Municipal Housing Charter’s, clearly indicates that the Municipality of Lisbon and State & Public Companies remain large landowners in the city (see maps).
We have created a map that combines this data.
Link to INTERACTIVE MAP
Interestingly, the Lisbon Land Registry function resides under the Ministry of Justice. The permanent certificate of land registry provides, online, all the data regarding a property, even the pending requests. It is always updated and available for consultation. The WEBSITE (INSTRUCTION (in Portuguese) of the Registo Predial Online offers the possibility of creating a ticket based on Town, parish (however, outdated taxonomy) and building number. The building number however can only be known if the interested party knows it (e.g. from a legal document such as a property sales contract) or applies for it in a physical office in Lisbon.
Application based on the property number (not land plot) is possible but costs 1 euro per entry (each apartment is one entry). For for purposes of this project, obtaining the scale of data would be simply beyond budget, and it may not even give much information on land. No data has therefore been purchased from this source.
As a test, a random search for buildings in the area of Santa Catarina (which is now part of the Misericórdia parish) revealed 650 possible buildings, several of which may contain multiple housing units. One could reduce the cost of the purchase by filtering out some buildings (for example, those known to be owned by the municipality), but this is not an option, as the cadaster building number is decoupled from its address.
Interviews with researchers conducting similar investigations (Cocola-Gant, A; Gago A.; Lima, R, and Silva R.) confirmed that large-scale land ownership investigations are an impossible or very costly task. Applications for buildings by their address costs 14 euro, need to be submitted via a physical office in Lisbon and are limited to 10 inquiries per day. According to some researchers, even the municipality’s own planning department may not have a clear overview on the municipal assets.
Lisbon serves as a prime illustration of how gentrification processes, initially disconnected from land ownership, originate in the city core and radiate outwards. Initially, urban rehabilitation efforts and incentives for transnational individuals and corporate investors attract foreign capital, which primarily targets properties such as apartments and housing units, and are not necessarily land focused. In the second instance, however, as the market matures, land plays an important role as the large-scale investors attracted by promising returns seek space for large-scale developments. Thus, as the property market in the central areas gets saturated, the new wave of large-scale investments provides a new supply of housing units, inflating the market further.
Amid rising cost of living, Lisbon city council has recently introduced measures to mitigate the effects of increased financialisation of the housing sector.
This February (2024) the municipality approved the new “Cooperativas 1ª Habitação Lisboa” programme which involves making municipal assets available to housing cooperatives for 90 years. This includes small plots of land for construction of affordable housing by the cooperatives. Furthermore, Lisbon’s Municipal Housing Charter just went through a 3-month long public consultation process (see also Civic Assembly’s website, the Report, and Maps). The Charter defines a strategy for the implementation of municipal housing policies between 2023 and 2033, representing an investment of 918 million euros. Its future is yet to be seen.
Special thanks to Agustín Cocola-Gant, Ana Gago, Rita Silva, Rafaella Lima for your valuable research and time sharing insights that enabled the writing of this blog post. In depth research, action and activism on the ground are the true powers able to change the trajectories of spatial injustice.

There is a certain pride in affirming the statement, “sou alfacinha” (I’m a little lettuce) when inquired by other Portuguese people about where in Portugal I am from.
Not that it isn’t already obvious from my bland accent. The one that, us Lisboners, call the ‘normal’ or ‘neutral’ Portuguese accent, but really is more of a muffled series of mumblings and swallowed word endings. Something resembling Spanish with a Russian accent, or so I’ve been told.
“Sou alfacinha”, I confirm, with a smile on my face. I smile, and then curl the sides of my mouth into an expression of confusion. Why on earth am I calling myself a lettuce? And a small one at that?
The expressions we provide on-demand, like automatized motions learned as toddlers, are often a complete mystery to us. We use them, seldom realizing what they actually mean.
Like a baton passed in an intergenerational rally race.
It’s a crisp morning. The kind that flaunts itself through the window as the day breaks. The sun is beaming through its seams and reflecting off the Atlantic coast, into the vast sky that paints the day blue.

Carried by the river Tagus is the mix of food, architecture, spices, and cultures that have blended together over the course of centuries to create present-day Lisbon. With the lure of vibrant yellow trams, delicious custard tarts, and promises of charming nearby towns, the rest of the world is turning up to discover one of Europe’s oldest (and most beautiful) capital cities.
Kelsey Lash is our intrepid travel writer who recently deepened her love of the Portuguese capital during an incredible stay at the Four Seasons Hotel. Kelsey tapped into the expertise of Lisbon native and local guru, João Santana Domingos, to take you on an immersive journey through the vibrant streets, profound history and captivating culture of the City of Seven Hills.
Lisbon’s history, which shines through modernity, is best experienced through taste — and there’s no better way to sample that diversity than with petiscos. These small portions of diverse and adventurous dishes can be washed down with a glass of vinho verde, a young wine with a distinctive fresh and fruity palette, cultivated by small growers in the country’s historic Minho province. Taverns and trendy bars alike present the perfect opportunity to experience Portuguese cuisine and lifestyle in one atmospheric sitting. Head to Bairro do Avillez where seafood and fish are always on the menu and sample the specialty red giant shrimp and razor clams.
With an undulating cityscape of peaks and urban valleys, Lisbon, like Rome, has seven hills, each with its own breathtaking view. Hop aboard the Tram 28 and let it carry you to to Miradouro das Portas do Sol, where the views of the Alfama neighborhood are without comparison or set off for the Miradouro da Senhora do Monte with an elevated vantage point and a wide scope view of the city. Take a sunset stroll up to the sloping, verdant lawns of Parque Eduardo VII, a 62-acre public park with vistas of the Tagus and beyond. Salute yourself for a day’s worth of climbing at one of our favorite wine bar’s, By The Wine, found in the heart of the elegant Chiado neighborhood.
Portugal is blessed with over 1,000 kilometers of beaches, and Lisbon has some of the best. Protected from Portugal’s infamous swells, Cascais enjoys sandy beaches, a busy marina, and scenic seaside cliffs with the dramatic Boca do Inferno (Hell’s Mouth) rock formation. Ride the waves at Guincho, an ideal beach for surfing and other water sports. Stretching for miles, Costa de Caparica has fantastic facilities and is ideal for families. Explore the pristine beach of Portinho da Arrábida, complete with rolling terrain and white, sandy shores. Whether you get your kicks from riding the waves, hiking the shore or burying your toes in the sand, there is no limit to the city’s coastal offerings.
See Lisbon the way locals do through barrios that have stood the test of time. Home to a vibrant community of locals, a legion of cafes and shops, and a lively small-town atmosphere, Alvalade and Avenidas Novas neighborhoods entice residents and travelers alike. Another in-vogue neighborhood, Marvila, has transformed abandoned warehouses into workspaces, artisan breweries, and art galleries. Have a beer at Dois Corvos, where they created the first artisan beer ever produced in Lisbon.
At the center of Campo de Ourique is the eponymous market, Mercado de Campo de Ourique. Dating back to 1934, the former farmer’s market has been painstakingly refurbished, yet retains the authenticity of its heyday. Packed with gourmet food stands offering options for all manner of tastes and moods, the lively hangout spot is bursting with colors, flavors and locals at lunch.
Reflecting the metamorphosis of Lisbon, the LX Factory has breathed new life into a former manufacturing complex in the Alcântara neighborhood. Combining arts and an entrepreneurial spirit, the sprawling, multifaceted mall has become one of the city’s coolest hangouts, with bookstores, hip fashion boutiques, interior design outlets alongside artists’ ateliers — all under one urban-industrial roof.
Discover the beating heart of Lisbon in Fado music, a Portuguese folk song of melancholic character usually accompanied by guitar and a traditional Portuguese meal. Since the early 19th century, Fado (literally: “fate” or “destiny”) has been an important fixture in everyday life of the Portuguese working class, where fadistas draw locals into dark taverns to be serenaded. Themes of resignation command the performances, but hopefulness is weaved throughout, a reminder that each ending is also the start of a new beginning.
Painted tiles, known as azulejos, made their way to the Iberian Peninsula in the 14th century and have since become synonymous with Portuguese culture. Examples are omnipresent in Lisbon, from the exquisite facade of Fronteira Palace to the cartoon-style murals inside Oriente Station to huge openair artworks gracing walls across the city. For an immersive, interactive exploration of the aesthetic tradition, take an exclusive tile-making workshop with artisans at a family-owned factory in the Arrabida National Park area.
A fairytale of palaces and castles, Sintra has charmed travelers for centuries. Protected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, European Romantic architecture reigns, yet beneath the colorful exterior the region holds dark secrets from its past: The well of the Quinta da Regaleira estate hides a concealed network of tunnels once used in obscure masonic rituals. Back on the sunny side, there are ancient ruins, hiking trails, and sand beaches to be discovered. Take a tour in a 1940s replica sidecar, beginning on the coast in Roca Cape and weaving through the Estoril Coast and Cascais Bay, before reaching the village.
Nature reserves often conjure images of inland oases, but Arrábida Natural Park is different. The area comprises a stunning section of wild coastline backed by fertile lands yielding Moscatel and Periquita grape varieties; follow the Costa Azul wine route to sample the region’s terroir and locally produced cheeses. Located just an hour’s transfer from Lisbon, this piece of paradise is accessed via the iconic Ponte de 25 de Abril bridge, redolent of the globally renowned Golden Gate in San Francisco. After an adventurous arrival, relax on secluded white sand beaches, go dolphin watching, and dine on freshly caught fish. Distinguished views, lush hills, and limestone cliffs constitute numerous hiking trails, and your expert guide will lead you to the footprints of dinosaurs dating to the Jurassic era.

Given a choice, I would any day pick either Braga or Porto over Lisbon and skip the latter altogether. The capital of Portugal is a beautiful city, no doubt, but it is also predictably touristy and, as such, immensely avoidable after a mandatory trip, or two. Having said that, it doesn’t always happen as per your wish.
During a recent trip to Lisbon, I made an earnest attempt to camouflage my prejudice, ensured the person accompanying me got to enjoy the best of everything Portugal’s capital city has to offer, and eventually didn’t regret making yet another visit to a city I have honestly got bored with. On an interesting note, I faced a unique predicament during my stay.
Football fans will be aware that the domestic season in Portugal got over recently, and I believe there is no better time to discuss my predicament. That the 2024–25 edition of the Primeira Liga went right down to the wire didn’t come across as a surprise. It was the 34th (and final) round of matches that decided the winner.

My very first impression of Lisbon was of a public parking lot taken over by gypsies. One guy, with the biggest tin of sausages I’ve ever seen, sidled up to the window of the campervan I was in with friends, & asked for a single euro, we handed it over without question. If there’s something everyone should know, it’s don’t mess with gypsies. When we came back at the end of the day the giant tin of sausages had been thrown, still 3/4 full, near one of the tyres, but the campervan was intact & as we left it. We considered that euro as the best value of the trip. I really regret not getting a photo of the sausages.
My lasting impression is that a visit to this city is a ticket to many beautiful experiences. The city has an energy, diversity, organised chaos & creativity that reflects a true metropolis.
» Triple bottom line, sustainability, (Socio-cultural, Economic & Environmental)I have now been to Lisbon 3 times, seeing 3 very different parts of the city & 3 very different experiences. Each visit building a picture of the city that I enjoy more each time. I think the public transport is one of the best I’ve seen. But, the major problem the city faces is that it seems like there’s a massive difference between the haves & the have-nots. If you catch a train or bus to Estação do Oriente you will see this fairly clearly. The only upside being that at least there is a sheltered place for people experiencing homelessness, a luxury not often afforded by people in the same situation in other cities, Vancouver comes to mind.
As a city that heavily relies on tourism, a blessing & curse for beautiful cities round the world, it has been subject to the highs & pitfalls of an industry that is never quite secure. The Portuguese were smart enough to create a digital nomad visa to attract location independent people from all over the world, which is adding a different layer to the economy & social mix. The only problem being that this causes impacts on living costs for residents.
Despite this, life is fairly cheap, food is exceptional & so is the wine. I walked through a shopping centre near Estação do Oriente while I waited for my bus & the place was completely packed with people loaded with shopping bags. But global labels selling well doesn’t mean much for the have nots.
Lisbon economic is the engine of the country, along with Porto, which is even moreso tourism focused. Lisbon has a focus of people, the city centre is only 100sqm with estimated 533,920 people but the outlying metropolitan area has over 3M people (worldpopulationreivew.com) & is the largest urban area in the EU.
To me Lisbon is a centre of creativity, artistry combined with technical proficiency. A great combination for design thinking. I can see that the people are open to social evolution, are connected to the global consciousness. I can see in the future this could really grow, expand & exported (as it already is).
» Tree canopy cover & evidence of biodiversityThis really depends where you are, apparently “approximately 8% of Lisbon is covered directly by canopy”(Franco & McDonald, 2018) & the feel on the ground is that there’s parts that are really green, but more parts that are not. I feel like I experienced therange of the spectrum with my last 2 visits, I stayed in complete opposite places. This is always good to do for a holistic view of a place, I like a little visit to a lower socio-economic place to bring me down to earth.
As far as biodiversity goes, I believe there is some left, I could hear birds & there was evidence of fauna in some of the parks. There are some really large parks which have wild parts to them, the below satelite map shows that there is large areas of greenspace, which you feel on the ground. There are breaks from the dense suburbs, which is an approach I actually really like, to densify housing & consolidate green space into large areas. A few small fish in the water, yes I did bring my snorkel mask like a total nerd.
Next time I go I want to spend a whole day walking around the large green space in the lower right hand corner of the below pic, Parque Florestal de Monsanto. I’ve been to the outskirts but in the middle, you can see the clearing about the road running through, this is a prison, it’s blurred out in Google maps, which always tickles the armpit of my curiosity. Even the prison in Wacol near Brisbane isn’t blurred out. I’m also interested in what Skycity is going to be like, which is in the middle of the greenspace closer to the middle of the image. Also indicated is Cascais for reference.
» Pedestrian, cyclists & motorcyclist friendlyI had so much fun cycling through Cascais when I was there. Cascais is a little out of Lisbon near the coast, but I think it still feels like an extension of the city out on the corner of the Tagus river & the Atlantic. In other parts of the city cycling is impossible because of the hills, but tuk-tuks are regulars now. In other parts it is normal to see confident cyclists getting about on the street & despite the heavy car traffic, they seem to be respected & allowed to take up space. I think partly because they’re also generally moving faster than said cars stuck in traffic. I think also partly because the Portuguese people seem very level headed & pragmatic, this said I would love to see more bike lanes painted in.
Yes, there are plenty of motorcycles getting about, there’s even a chapter of the Litas (a worldwide womxn only riding club) that exists there. It is the perfect place for getting around the skinny streets or getting out on the weekend.
» Public transport system effectiveness
I love a good short wait for a train & easy transfer to another line, & the system here delivers the goods. Ahhh :) Those accustomed to the shitshow of the Brisbane heavy rail system will also be enamoured with this one. I also like when a place has good people watching, which Lisbon provides, it’s not the veritable freak show in NYC, but you definitely want to be wearing sunglasses to check people out (in a non creepy way pls).
I also like how clean & comfortable the trains are. There are buses too, which I still haven’t been on, but from the maps it looks like a good amount of the city is well connected. Another good thing is that the transport card, which is cheap to buy, will get you everywhere in the greater metropolitan area, even to Cintra, the most magical fairy castle place I’ve ever seen.
» Residents experiencesI really think in this case it depends on where you live, thus why I was so glad to experience both sides of the proverbial tracks. I think that both sides have a good life, there’s all the opulence & luxury you can afford, at the same time there’s plenty of social, low cost housing, if you can get it. I think city possibly does the tired old dance of focusing funds to the streetscapes of the tourist & wealthy areas, but at the same time if you’re not wealthy there’s a lot of little stalls & hustles going on which can keep unskilled people going. I don’t doubt that the have-nots have it tough though.
I think I’d be interested to know how accessible university education is in Lisbon, I think this is going to be key to the future as the city’s population is aging. I think a well educated workforce has the potential to do better during the rough times ahead (for most cities) as retirees outweigh working adults. Some of the most intelligent, multilingual & interesting people I’ve ever met were Portuguese (shout out to Claudia Taborda, one of my lecturers at QUT), so I get the impression education is at a high level here.
• Now to the weirder things I care about
» Can I drink alone at a bar & not feel judged?For me yes, I have done this every time I’ve visited & loved the whole experience. I felt sexy & mysterious & was not subject to a single judgy face. As with Paris, I would drink or eat alone there any day. In fact I had one of the best Thai curries of my life at an Indian restaurant in Cascais watching motorcycle racing on the big screen at a table next to a guy doing the same. Couldn’t have felt more acceptable. I have a friend who lives there who often sends me photos of cocktails he’s drinking alone at the beachfront, sometimes he takes his cat, it all sounds like a dream. Also, I once went to a Fado restaurant, without booking, like a dummy, but managed to snag a seat opposite a truly interesting woman from Dubai, also getting about alone, we shared a plate of snacks, the enchanting music and single woman traveller stories, truly one of my most favourite nights, made possibly because I was solo.
» Are the plants realYes, lots of real plants in restaurants, can’t say I recall seeing many plastic plants getting about. But I haven’t been through the whole city yet so maybe next time I’ll notice it & need to do a retraction. There is so much bougainvillea doing really well, which just adds to the ambiance.
» Is it safe to walk alone at night?Yes, for me anyway. The last 2 times I was there I walked back to my accommodation alone late at night, in 2 very different areas, passing all sorts of characters, but felt safe. I may have made another woman feel unsafe as I followed her back to the guesthouse we were both staying at, she did not want to chat. Still useful to be street smart.
» Do people dance? (self consciousness rating)Yesss! Ah it’s very nice to see, people dancing at clubs, even in an afternoon, or on the beach next to the volleyball courts. There is a bit of an athletic vibe, especially with the younger adults, so I think dance ability comes with that.
» Is there cool old shit with cool stories, other than churches or cathedrals?So much! Books shops, bars, castles, just the cobbled streets are super interesting, the trams are great, this is a city for all senses, visual & taste especially. This is like the epicentre of non-religious cool old shit (plenty of old religious shit for those that way inclined).
» Pet trends, dogs in bars & dog parksI didn’t notice that many dogs to be honest with you, I think this speaks to the transitionary lifestyle people have here, but I did see some at the beachside cafes & they looked very welcome there, I wouldn’t think twice about having a dog in this city. Plenty of walkabouts to get up to, plenty of parks too.
» Do people stare at my tattoos? Are there alt folk about?I feel like this is the least starey place I’ve been, no one gives a shit, plenty of other tattooed people about, you can be whoever you want to be. I think this all goes with the general progressive & globally connected vibes. There is a continuation of tradition, but there’s also a tolerance & acceptance that I really like.
» General vibe notesIt’s just a cool city, not squeaky clean, has a certain amount of grit. But I think it’s a good place to get fat & happy — or fit & hippy. Up to you on that journey. All the food I had there was incredible. The people are lovely, & mostly speak English so it’s real easy for a dumb monolinguist like me (hot tip, more people speak English than Spanish, so don’t gracias, instead stick to either obrigada/o or thanks).
Not yet mentioned is the Pastel de Nata —this is very important! If you do one thing it’s visit Pastel de Belem, wait for as long as necessary, order an espresso & 2 pastels, don’t make the mistake of thinking 1 is sufficient, I think 6 is actually the correct amount.
I think one thing that could be a critique, is how it sprawls, even though there are places closer that could be renewed with some creativity & investment. This is the problem with older cities, there’s places that have been around for centuries, sometimes millennia, but who’s going to make a decision on removing the remains when they become useless. It’s a decision I don’t know the answer for, since I am from Brisbane which has a fairly rigorous demo & rebuild policy for anything over 15–40yrs old.
Not sure if anyone can tell this, but I would jump at the chance to live in Lisbon.

Lisbon, the capital city of Portugal, is a captivating blend of rich history, vibrant culture, and breathtaking landscapes. Nestled on the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula, Lisbon has long been a hub of exploration, trade, and cultural exchange. This article delves into the fascinating history of Lisbon, highlights its must-visit places, and provides insights on the best time to explore this enchanting city.
Lisbon’s history is a tapestry woven with diverse influences and remarkable events. The city’s origins can be traced back to the Phoenicians around 1200 BCE, who established a settlement called “Alis Ubbo.” Over the centuries, Lisbon was inhabited by various civilizations, including the Romans, Visigoths, and Moors, each leaving an indelible mark on the city’s culture and architecture.
Roman and Moorish Eras
During the Roman era, Lisbon, known as Olissipo, flourished as a significant trading post. The Romans constructed roads, bridges, and aqueducts, some of which still stand today. The fall of the Roman Empire saw Lisbon transition into the hands of the Visigoths and later the Moors. The Moors, who ruled from the 8th to the 12th century, infused the city with Islamic culture, architecture, and advancements in agriculture and science. The Alfama district, with its narrow winding streets and Moorish influences, remains a testament to this period.
The Age of Discovery
The 15th and 16th centuries marked Lisbon’s golden age during the Age of Discovery. Under the leadership of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portuguese explorers set sail from Lisbon, embarking on voyages that would change the world. Vasco da Gama’s discovery of the sea route to India in 1498 and subsequent expeditions established Lisbon as a global maritime power. The wealth and knowledge brought back by these explorers fueled the Renaissance in Portugal, leading to significant advancements in art, science, and architecture.
Earthquake and Reconstruction
The devastating earthquake of 1755, followed by a tsunami and fires, razed much of Lisbon to the ground. The Marquis of Pombal spearheaded the city’s reconstruction, implementing innovative urban planning and architectural techniques. The Baixa district, with its grid-like streets and neoclassical buildings, emerged from this reconstruction, symbolizing Lisbon’s resilience and rebirth.
Lisbon is a city that begs to be explored, with its historic neighborhoods, iconic landmarks, and cultural gems offering a rich tapestry of experiences for visitors.
Alfama: The Alfama district is the oldest neighborhood in Lisbon, characterized by its labyrinthine streets, traditional Fado music, and stunning viewpoints. Visitors can wander through its narrow alleys, visit the São Jorge Castle, and enjoy the panoramic views from Miradouro da Graça.
Belém: Belém is synonymous with Portugal’s Age of Discovery. This district is home to the iconic Belém Tower, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and the Jerónimos Monastery, a masterpiece of Manueline architecture. The Monument to the Discoveries, located along the Tagus River, pays tribute to the explorers who set sail from Lisbon.
Baixa and Chiado: Baixa and Chiado are bustling districts in the heart of Lisbon. Baixa is known for its elegant squares, such as Praça do Comércio and Rossio Square, as well as the Elevador de Santa Justa, a stunning neo-Gothic elevator offering panoramic views of the city. Chiado, on the other hand, is a cultural and commercial hub, with its theaters, bookstores, and vibrant cafés.
Bairro Alto: Bairro Alto is Lisbon’s bohemian quarter, famous for its lively nightlife and artistic atmosphere. As the sun sets, the neighborhood comes alive with Fado music, trendy bars, and restaurants serving traditional Portuguese cuisine. During the day, visitors can explore its unique shops and historic buildings.
LX Factory: LX Factory, a former industrial complex, has been transformed into a creative and cultural hub. Located in the Alcântara district, it features trendy shops, art galleries, restaurants, and a lively atmosphere. The iconic Ler Devagar bookstore, with its towering bookshelves and whimsical décor, is a must-visit.
Lisbon’s Mediterranean climate makes it an attractive destination year-round, but the best time to visit depends on your preferences and interests.
Spring (March to May): Spring is one of the best times to visit Lisbon, as the weather is mild and the city is in full bloom. The temperatures range from 15°C to 20°C (59°F to 68°F), making it perfect for exploring the city’s outdoor attractions. Additionally, the spring months see fewer tourists compared to the summer, providing a more relaxed experience.
Summer (June to August): Summer in Lisbon is warm and bustling with activity. Temperatures can soar to 30°C (86°F) or higher, making it ideal for enjoying the city’s beaches and outdoor festivals. However, this is also the peak tourist season, so expect larger crowds and higher prices for accommodation and attractions.
Autumn (September to November): Autumn is another excellent time to visit Lisbon, with pleasant temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). The summer crowds begin to thin out, and the city’s parks and gardens are adorned with vibrant fall colors. September, in particular, is a great month to experience the city’s cultural events and festivals.
Winter (December to February): Winter in Lisbon is mild compared to other European cities, with temperatures rarely dropping below 8°C (46°F). While there may be occasional rain, the city remains lively with Christmas markets, festive lights, and cultural events. Winter is also the off-peak season, offering more affordable accommodation options.
Lisbon is a city that seamlessly blends its rich historical heritage with contemporary culture and vibrant energy. From its ancient neighborhoods and iconic landmarks to its creative hubs and lively districts, Lisbon offers a diverse range of experiences for every traveler. Whether you’re exploring the narrow streets of Alfama, marveling at the architectural wonders of Belém, or enjoying the nightlife in Bairro Alto, Lisbon promises a journey filled with discovery and enchantment. Additionally, check holidays in Portugal prior to travel to improve your overall tour experience. So, pack your bags and set out to explore this captivating city, where the past and present converge in a harmonious symphony of culture, history, and adventure.

I arrived at the cafe/bakery and thought about getting a number to be served. Before I could do it, a nice man gave me his number. This is a Portuguese way of living. They are always helpful.
It was so relaxing to sit in the bakery and have coffee with a croissant. I could stay there all day just writing and drawing, or people-watching.
And or walking on the banks of the river on Parque das Nações.
Today I had codfish with spinach and chickpea puree. And then again, in a different way, as a snack with apple juice and strawberry. You can find all kinds of fish everywhere you go here.
On the banks of the Tagus River, I was surprised and happy to hear a Brazilian song.
I recently had the opportunity to visit Lisbon, the capital of Portugal again. I immediately felt at home with the city’s beauty, its rich history, and its vibrant culture. There is art everywhere.

Beyond here, there’s nothing. Ne plus ultra, the Romans carved on the Pillars of Hercules at the narrow neck where Spain almost, almost touches Africa.
They were talking about the wild, tempest-tossed Atlantic, of course. A swelling, storming, steel-grey wilderness that devoured their ships the way killer whales now devour the rudders of billionaire’s yachts.
Ignore the warning. You can sail out between the pillars of Hercules. The Romans knew that.
The wild Atlantic swallowed Ulysses, but more modest men of cunning made their way tortuously along the coast to Lisbon. In Alfama, the ancient fishing district with an Arabic name that survived the 1755 earthquake that reshaped the city entirely, you can still see the ruins of the Roman empire’s last settlement before the sea.
Lisbon is the westernmost city in Europe. And after visiting every capital city in Western Europe, after traveling from Sicily to Stockholm and from Warsaw to Wrexham, Lisbon, and Portugal as a whole, remained a barely explicable gap in our charted territory.
We liked it right away.

Blink and you will miss the tiny little pride flags stuck in the windows of shops and cafes in Lisbon. Blink and you might miss its queer culture entirely.
When I first visited Lisbon’s unofficial “gay village” it was a culture shock in comparison to the vibrant gay village of my city, Montreal. Nestled among the hip streets of Lisbon’s Bairro Alto district, the streets looked like any other. If I had not gone on the queer walking tour that I found on AirBnB Experiences, I might have assumed there was very little openly queer culture in Lisbon.
How delightfully wrong I was! Lisbon showed me that there are many ways different countries express and celebrate LGBTQ culture. While in Canada we feel that queer expression must be loud and visible, Portugal seemed to take a laid-back approach that felt fitting for their more laid-back approach to life.
Beautiful tiled buildings cast shade upon the Bairro Alto’s carefully crafted stone streets. Cozy tables and chairs were set up on wide sidewalks outside restaurants that smelled of herbs, fish and a smattering of international cuisines.
I had walked these same streets during the day; they were quiet aside from a few shoppers and seniors chattering about life as they strolled. As I…

Ah, the Alfama district of Lisbon! Land of incipient heart attacks and broken ankles. Spoiler Alert — I avoided both. Narrowly.
Before I get into today’s festivities, let’s back up to yesterday (or actually the day before) when I left San Francisco on my latest quest to visit slightly off the beaten path destinations before I get too decrepit to visit them. This trip will take me to Morocco.
But first, a stop in Lisbon.
I managed to snag another insanely cheap fare to Lisbon — $375 round trip! The downside was that I had to fly through Munich. The upside was that I flew through Munich which meant that I got to go through EU immigration in Munich instead of Lisbon — which based on recent experience, probably saved me about 2 hours of standing in line. Honestly, I think it was a good tradeoff, especially considering the price point.
I arrived in Lisbon late — nearly 10:00 p.m. Because I was arriving late and my stay is so short, I decided to splurge (by my standards) and stay at the Melia Airport hotel. After waiting too long for my bag (but hey, it showed up), I walked across the street, checked in, took a shower and went to bed. I can’t remember the last time I arrived at a foreign destination at bedtime, but I consider that to be a complete luxury…

Lisbon is full of surprises. It doesn’t matter if you have visited it a thousand times, there will always be another little street, corner or “beco” that will lead you to a new square or to a colorful building that you have never seen before. Here is a guide that will lead you to those beautiful not-that-well-known neighborhoods!
If you have been in Lisbon, it is likely that you have seen the Assembleia da República (Portugal’s chamber of Congress) or the Basílica da Estrela. Well, not that far from those places, there is a little neighborhood that has survived the last waves of tourism. It’s called Madragoa, and it’s one of the most authentic and beautiful places in Lisbon!
José Saramago, a portuguese writer and Nobel prize winner, lived in Madragoa. About it, he wrote: “in one of the hillsides of Lapa, it’s Madragoa, named that way after the people of the sea (or “mar”, in portuguese) came to live here after the XVI century”.
You can walk through the Rua da Esperança (the same street where Saramago lived) and see some cozy little coffee shops and traditional Tascas, or go uphill to Rua das Madres and be amazed with the colours of typical Lisbon’s houses.
2. Penha da Franca
Penha da França it’s located above Arroios neighborhood, and right next to Graça. And even though it’s centrally located, not that many tourists knows about it. A main reason why many young locals have chosen this area to live.
Penha da França features two amazing view points: the Miradouro do Monte Agudo and the Miradouro da Penha da França. Also, you’ll find delicious nepalese restaurants, proper portuguese’s tascas and interesting antique shops. You can even go to the Alto de São João cemetery, which has unique monuments and amazing river views.
And because of it’s location, you can walk right into it! From OnJ S. Lázaro hotel, you’ll only have to walk through Avenida Almirante Reis, and the go uphill taking one of the many stairs, like the one in Rua Cidade de Manchester or Rua Cidade de Cardiff.
3. Bica
To be fair, it is likely that the Bica elevator will appear on your travel guide, or at least that your tour guide will recommend it to you. Not of that matters: we still think that the Bica neighborhood is wildly underrated.
First, as you can see from the main photography of this article (made by notorious @francisco_crocco), Bica is huge, colorful and hilly. Second: in the past years, it has become one of the coolest neighborhoods in Lisbon, and a lot of new restaurants have opened there, mainly in the Rua de Sao Paulo.
The stairs, the little squares or “largos”, and the notorious Miradouro de Santa Catarina definitely need a longer visit.
4. Obvioulsy, you can’t miss the rest of Lisbon!
By highlighting these neighborhoods of Lisbon, we don’t mean for you to skip the beautiful Alfama, Graça, Baixa or Bairro Alto.
As we said before, if you come to Lisbon, you’ll never stop to discover new corners to fall in love with.
Check out the rest of our posts, and see waht they have to offer!

How to Connect with Others in Lisbon: 10 Great Lisbon Meetups 2022,https://gabrielanaumnik.medium.com/how-to-connect-with-others-in-lisbon-10-great-lisbon-meetups-2022-3c7e590c8444,"Sign up

If you’re reading this article, it means you’re hoping to meet new people in Lisbon, that’s awesome! You may be considering moving here permanently, exploring Lisbon as a digital nomad, or you may have lived here for a while and feel like it’s the time to get out there and make new friendships. Whatever the reason, the answer to “How do I begin?” is the same: download the Meetup App.
In case you were wondering why I’m recommending Meetup instead another app: no, I’m not affiliated with Meetup in any way. When I first came to Lisbon at the beginning of 2022, I tried out various apps, and Meetup stood out to me as the one with the most significant number of interesting-sounding events that fill up quickly.
So, in this article, I would love to mention a list of Meetups that I found particularly worthy of checking out. If you think that I missed out on any excellent Meetup event, please leave a comment below so that everyone can benefit :)
The list of great 10 Meetups includes:
Curious Monkey
This is a non-profit group and a creative space for sharing knowledge about art and bringing together local and expat communities in Lisbon. They organize various events, including yoga, open mics, and talks with book authors, journalists, and casts of well-known shows such as Cirque Du Soleil. If you’re looking for some quality conversations, then Curious Monkey will be a great group to join!
www.meetup.com
Drink & Draw
Drink & Draw hosts pop-up drawing sessions in unique locations around Lisbon. For around twenty euros, you can enjoy a mobile-phone-free session with incredible people at a beautiful local winery or a cafe. Each participant is handed a set of drawing materials upon entry and a drink choice, and then the drawing begins! Two or more models pose in the middle of the room, and participants are given tasks such as “draw the model in 30 sec” or “draw the model in 7 min but with the opposite hand.” It’s a lot of fun and an excellent opportunity to explore your drawing technique.
www.meetup.com
Future Founders
I’m a big fan of this group because I always leave their events feeling inspired and with a sense that I learned something new. The group attracts founders, product people, and venture capitalists. It’s the perfect place to obtain or give feedback, discuss technology, and get funding! Some of the events take place in a park where participants gather in small groups to discuss challenges and ideas, and then the groups are swapped every 15–20 min. For those of you who have a business registered in Portugal, this may be an excellent place to learn more about the legal side of things as the group hosts talks dedicated to this topic as well.
www.meetup.com
Lisbon Digital Nomads
Boasting 17K+ members at the time of writing, this group is growing fast and is the best way to connect with other digital nomads and make new like-minded friends. The group organizes recurring running, networking, and board game events. The event spots tend to exceed 100 participants per event, but don’t be disappointed if you end up on a waiting list. You can still show up to the event and be admitted!
www.meetup.com
Polylogue’s Lightning Talks
If there were a category for the most thought-provoking event host, Polylogue would win. The idea behind this group is simple yet powerful: whoever shows up can give a 5 min talk about any topic of their choice. The host will provide a projector, a microphone, and snacks. The reason why I love this event so much is that it forces you in a way to learn something new that you would otherwise not look into. Topics range from highly technical concepts to funny talks about delivering packages to the most secluded places in the world to relationship advice. Whatever the case may be, it’s always fun, and it’s a great way to meet people who are passionate about what they do in life. Additionally, if you’re looking for a new coworking space, attending Lightning Talks may help you decide, as the events are hosted across various coworks.
www.meetup.com
Lisbon Supper Club
I first encountered this concept in Lisbon and immediately fell in love with it. This is how it works: you sign up for a themed supper (for example, a “British Roast” or “Truffle Lovers”), pay around 25 euros, and then attend the supper with up to 20 people who also signed up. The interesting twist is that the supper takes place in the dining room inside the chef’s apartment which creates an incredible atmosphere encouraging all the strangers to get to know one another by the end of the feast. The food is delicious, the ambiance is magical, and the new friendships last!
www.meetup.com
Passport Comedy
I’m not going to lie, I had low expectations for this group before going to their first event. And then — haha! Little did I know how excellent these events would turn out to be. Passport Comedy has a solid lineup of comedians who will guarantee you an evening filled with tears of laughter. I laughed there more than at the Comedy Cellar in NYC. Grab your spot before these comedians begin doing Netflix Stand-Up Comedy Specials — it’s worth it!
www.meetup.com
Storytelling Lisboa
The concept of this group is quite fascinating. Each event has a specific theme, such as “Chaos,” “Breaks,” or “Landlords,” and one thing in common — participants can volunteer to spend 10 min telling their story to an audience of 200+ people. Anyone can volunteer to tell a story, but there can be no more than ten speakers per event. The stories range from sad to funny, and the events are hosted in English or Portuguese. I was impressed by how well-structured, emotional, and thought-provoking these stories are. It’s an event format that is worth checking out at least once.
www.meetup.com
The Block Lisboa
This article wouldn’t be complete without at least one mention of a crypto-focused group. The Block hosts many crypto, NFT, and developer events. Some of them are more technical and may require prior knowledge, so make sure to read through the event description. I attended an excellent NFT workshop that felt like a whole course on NFTs, met extremely savvy people, and enjoyed great food. Regardless of how familiar you’re with blockchain, I strongly recommend looking through what The Block offers as long as you’re curious about how things work.
www.meetup.com
Two Left Feet
And finally, salsa and bachata! This group guarantees a relaxing evening filled with music and dance moves. As long as the weather’s good, the classes take place outdoors, and the instructor explains each move clearly. While dancing, the participants are asked to switch partners with every new song, so this class is a great way to get better at salsa and bachata and an excellent way to make new friends.
www.meetup.com
That’s it! I strongly recommend checking out these Meetup groups. I realize there are other great groups out there, so if you feel like I missed any of them, please leave a comment so that every reader can benefit from your recommendation. I am seeing more and more groups being added weekly, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this list grows 10x by the end of 2023!

SUNDAY
When traveling from the U.S., prepare to be jet lagged when you arrive in Lisbon (especially if you use a long flight to catch up on all of your Netflix and HBOMax). By the time I arrived at the Corinthia Hotel in Lisbon, I was out of sorts. I ordered a pot of mint tea (it was late morning there) and scurried up to my room. Corinthia Lisbon was my travel partner for a portion of my Lisbon stay and they spared no detail in making me feel right at home. I was fortunate enough to snag one of their recently renovated Maritime Suites. I hesitate to use the word suite though — with two bathrooms, two televisions, an office, a walk-in closet, and nightly pastries with turn-down service — it felt more like an apartment.
After a jaw-dropping twirl through my suite — I noted a make-up vanity, two televisions, rainforest showerhead shower, a bidet and a fluffy king-sized mattress — I decided to climb into my huge floor tub with massive up-to-the-ceiling windows boasting a view of city life below. The suite comes with decadent toiletries so I opted for the bath gel (which is also a bubble bath) and a packet of bath salts. I positioned my teapot on the cushion seating adjacent to the tub and sipped hot tea while luxuriating in my bubble bath.
After a quick nap, I decided to leave my comfortable enclave long enough to eat. The LX Factory boasts art murals, eclectic mix of restaurants and shops, live music and a bohemian flea market every Sunday. I settled on a Mexican restaurant, and sat outside for top-tier people watching and margarita drinking. At the flea market I scored a patterned brass ring and an ear cuff with colored stones for 20 Euros.
Back at the Corinthia, I went downstairs to the hotel spa. The spa is one of the largest indoor spas in Lisbon, and comes complete with treatment rooms, a salon, a full-sized indoor pool with outdoor patio, and a water therapy circuit. The therapy circuit was the perfect choice for my jet lag: a series of very cold, followed by warm and hot streams, jets, pools, and whirlpools, along with a sauna and steam room. I blissfully lost track of time in the circuit. Several times I fell asleep and eventually came to, more relaxed than ever as the jets intentionally and methodically worked out every knot and lulled me back to sleep. I spent about two and a half hours there on the first day, and returned each day of my stay.
That night, I dined at Erva, one of the hotel’s incredible restaurants. It was here that I fell in love with green wine, an effervescent libation native to Portugal that is actually white in color. As it was explained to me, the grapes are not fully ripened when fermented (hence the word green), so the wine is lower in sugar and alcohol content (in comparison to white or red wine). You can find it anywhere in Lisbon, and it pairs perfectly with any seafood meal. Speaking of seafood, the grilled squid and the lamb croquettes that I ordered were phenomenal.
MONDAY
Still jet lagged, I awoke late and opted for another visit to the hotel spa. Motivated by hunger and a desire to explore the must-see areas on my list, I took an Uber to Pink Street. Given that I was a solo traveler, I had been told by the concierge that it was best to visit this area in the day (at night it becomes a bit more clubby). There I got my obligatory photo, beneath the famed art installation of colorful, rainbow umbrellas and standing atop concrete that actually is pink in color.
From there, I walked over to Time Out Market Lisboa. This place is a food lover’s dream. You can find sushi, croquettes, steak, seafood, desserts, cocktails and more. I opted for a grilled seafood platter that came with a generously-portioned fish fillet, calamari, and shrimp served with a plate of broccoli. While it is supposed to be a platter for two, I was that hungry and it was that good. It was one of my best meals in Lisbon; I would eventually make my way back there again on my last night there.
From here, I took an Uber to happy hour at Go A Lisboa, a rooftop bar with gorgeous views, R&B music vibes and Morocco-inspired furniture.
TUESDAY and WEDNESDAY
I left Lisbon and headed South to the stunning Algarve region. From Lisbon, the travel possibilities are endless: next time, I may choose to explore Porto or Evora. It’s easy and affordable to zip around the country via the high speed train. Not only is it chic, sophisticated, and comfortable — it’s also a safe alternative if you’re traveling solo and want to avoid driving on unfamiliar roads.
THURSDAY
Back in Lisbon, I kicked off my day with a visit to the Museu Nacional do Azulejo (the National Tile Museum) to learn about this form of artistry which is heavily featured throughout the streets of Lisbon — so much so that it is internationally recognized as part of the city’s brand. You’ll learn about etymology (e.g., azulejo, the Portuguese word for tile, has Arabic derivations) and witness the opulence of centuries-old Portuguese churches (think: all gold everything).
For dinner, I visited Bairro do Avillez in the Chiado neighborhood. The venue is open from 12pm — 12am daily, and boasts several different restaurants, each with its own distinct flavor and style. I sat outside and enjoyed a seafood and soupy rice dish that was filling and decadent thanks to the copious amounts of the lobster meat, shrimp and clams. It was one of my pricier meals in Lisbon but incredibly satisfying.
I worked some of my dinner off with a short walk to the famed Tasca do Chico, an understated, slightly cramped bar featuring incredibly live fado musicians each night. Given the close quarters, you will likely be seated with strangers; this lends itself to an friendly, social ambiance where guests interact and greet one another. I spent most of my time lost in the soulful traditional fado music. While I could not understand the words, I felt them somehow and the Portuguese guitar provided the perfect backdrop to this emotional, auditory experience. I met the most amazing crew during the second showing of the night (fellow New Yorkers!). I also finally sampled ginja, a potent, cherry-based liqueur that originates in Lisbon.
FRIDAY
I had an early morning meet-up with Naky, my tour guide and also the creator of the Africa in Lisbon tour, in the harbor-facing plaza of Praça do Comércio (Commerce Square). Our group was primarily composed of Black American tourists. We also had a Portuguese woman in our group. It became clear very early on that she had not learned anything in school about her country’s prolific slave trading, or how it treated Black people both during and post-slavery. According to her, the myth of the “good colonizer” permeated her upbringing with romanticized tales of gentle Portuguese conquerors who fell in love with their colonized inhabitants and built families with them — while the Spanish and British raped and pillaged their conquests throughout the world. She was incredulous to discover on Naky’s tour that those favorable depictions of her country were false.
Africa in Lisbon is a walking tour and I highly recommend it to all, regardless of race or nationality. After a day spent discussing some heavier topics, the tour ended with levity: a group lunch and cocktails al fresco at Mambo, a restaurant featuring delicious African cuisine.
From here, I walked to Java, a gorgeous rooftop bar with an exquisite breeze and impressive water views. It was another rooftop on my Lisbon list, and well worth the trip.
Afterwards, I hopped in an Uber and met my new friends at the incredibly popular Cervejaria Ramiro, a seafood restaurant in the Alfama neighborhood. The menu is extensive — we feasted on sea snails and barnacles — right along with the more familiar shrimp and clams. All were phenomenally flavorful and well-priced at this unpretentious neighborhood gem. Their buttered bread is also worth mentioning. Come prepared to eat well and ready to take a walk on the wilder side in terms of your palate and menu selections.
SATURDAY
Despite the rain, there was already a line formed outside when I arrived at Nicolau for brunch. I heard it was Instagrammable and delicious — and it certainly was (although smaller than I’d imagined). I was seated at a lovely corner table where I could watch the rain from a dry seat. The menu is perfect for those with a sweet tooth but I opted for toast with fluffy cheese and prosciutto. The plan was to head to the world-famous Flea Market, but the rain forced me to make a last-minute schedule change.
I took an Uber to Museu de Arte, Arquitetura e Tecnologia (MAAT). The views here are breathtaking — rain or shine. I explored the two exhibits and then popped next door to have a drink at the MAAT Café & Kitchen. The ambiance is perfection — light jazz music, indoor foliage and a sweeping view of the water that steals the show entirely. For every 30 Euros you spend at the café, you get one free adult admission to the museum. Next time I visit the MAAT, I will start at the MAAT Café (I hear the food is excellent).
Lisbon is known for, among other things, a custard pastry called pastel de nata. From MAAT, I walked over to the famous Pasteis de Belem to sample the most famous pastel de nata of all, derived from a secret recipe that has been shared with the masses since 1837. My pastels were piping hot, fresh from the oven and melt-in-your-mouth memorable. It’s worth the trip to Belem but remember that the line is for people waiting to be seated; you don’t have to wait in it if you’re purchasing your pastels to-go. While in Belem, I visited the Tower of Belem. It’s a major tourist attraction as it is one of the only original buildings to have survived an earthquake in 1755 that decimated much of the region. I saw a bride nearby taking captivating photos with the picturesque, imposing tower behind her.
After a day filled with delicious food — both savory and decadent — and cocktails, I wasn’t starving. But given that it was my last night, I went back to Time Out Lisbon for my favorite meal thus far: the grilled seafood platter. It was just as delicious as I remembered it. I sat next to a couple on a date and was slightly embarrassed by the fact that they were sharing the same platter that I had polished off alone for the second time that week. I also grabbed a pastel de nata from Manteigiara, a modern-day confectionaries with a recipe that many prefer to Pasteis de Belem. My personal opinion? I preferred the pastry of Pasteis de Belem and the custard filling of Manteigiara. For that reason, I’ll likely reach for Manteigiara next time. Definitely sample them both and form your own opinion.
To round out the evening, I met my new friends at Museu do Fado for one last night of fado music. I preferred the ambience of Tasca do Chico where we had all met a few nights prior but the performers at the museum were top-notch. Once again, the Portuguese guitar and the melodious fado lyrics, enveloped us with their haunting and enchanting beauty. It was a perfect farewell to a city that had, in such a short time, become so dear. Até a próxima, Lisboa.

Lisbon is old, but it never gets old. This is the fourth visit for us since October 2021. The more Teresa and I come here, the more we want to return again.
Visiting a city for just a few days creates an artificial impulse to see and do as much as possible, to check main attractions off a list. But now that we have already seen a good number of the tourist highlights, there’s absolutely no pressure to do anything other than to flâneur — to wander about without a plan, following our noses and keeping our eyes open for the unexpected. Just taking a stroll from our hotel to the city center and back is enough fun for a day. Being less dazzled by the monuments, churches and palaces allows the quirkiness of Lisbon to better reveal itself.
For example, here’s a statue of a purple woman, brandishing a dust buster right next to Lisbon’s famous antique elevator in the Chiado shopping district:
By the waterfront, I saw an old man painting and piling up stones into works of art. Here’s a shark he made (below left, in the lower right corner) and a supine mermaid (below right):
Teresa and I are still entranced by the winding, cramped streets of the old Alfama and Mouraria districts that surround St. George’s Castle. They offer surprising bursts of color and beauty: pink and turquoise laundry on a line that mirrors pink and turquoise buildings the next block over. A yellow budgie in a cage against a yellow wall. A peacock done in azulejos (tile art) on a random wall — and look at the unpredictable azulejos blue egg that peacock guards!
It is distressing, though, to see the many buildings that have fallen into disrepair in Lisbon, their windows broken or boarded up, doors chained shut, plaster falling off the walls. We found one grand apartment complex in the tony downtown Comércio district that was in bad shape. It bore a grey, mildewy banner advertising luxury apartments for sale, but obviously, the deal had gone sour years ago. No one had even bothered to pull down the embarrassing sign. (In case you are curious, the website displayed on the sign (below) no longer exists).
Clearly, Lisbon still has its challenges. One taxi driver told us the city is sinking due to last year’s prolonged drought. This sounded counter-intuitive, but he explained that the drought caused the water table beneath the city to drop. That exposed many of the old wooden pylons in the underground river that prop up the city from below. When the pylons began to dry out, they began to rot and weaken. Even though last year’s drought was ended by catastrophic floods in December, the damage has been done. As climate change persists, the problem will only get worse.
One afternoon I went out to drop off our laundry, and then decided to wander into the backstreets of the Bairro Alto neighbourhood. I decided that at each intersection I would simply take whatever turn went most steeply uphill. I zigged and zagged along quiet little backstreets, with the odd cafe on a corner or bakery shop, and then round the last corner I came to an open hilltop with a little park, two posh hotels, and a spectacular lookout. This turned out to be the Miradouro de Santa Catarina, a viewpoint that bore an optimistic message for all who made it up to the promontory:
Behind the viewpoint, in the center of the little park, a jagged rocky peak jutted up. No—on second glance it was a stone sculpture of a giant, his hair and beard wild as if in a tempest, his eyes bulging with fury. In front of him stood a small bronze man, with what I swear looked like a smartphone in his hands. His head looked up, as if he had just been texting and then discovered this menacing monster right in front of him.
Well, this was not a modern cautionary tale for our device-addicted times. A plaque identified the statue as Adamastor. It turned out to be a sculpture of a pivotal character in Os Lusiadas, a Portuguese epic poem written by Luís de Camões the mid 1500s. The epic is to Portugal what the Odyssey is to Greece: a mythic rendering of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama’s sea voyage to India in 1497—the first such by any European. This was the voyage that marked the beginning of Portugal’s global empire and rise to power.
In the poem, da Gama and his crew must sail around the treacherous southern tip of Africa, then known as the Cabo das Tormentas, the “Cape of Torment.” Suddenly the Titan Adamastor rises from the wild seas, blocking their passage. He is both the rock of the Cape itself, and an embodiment of the terror of the unknown. Indeed, sailors of that time really believed that monsters inhabited uncharted seas. In facing their fears and successfully rounding the cape, da Vasco’s crew proved they had the spirit Portugal needed to reach their destination and find their destiny. In both the poem and in real life, da Gama renamed this treacherous place “The Cape of Good Hope.”
Standing on this magnificent viewpoint overlooking the ocean, I feel the aptness of that metaphor today, and not just for Portugal. Really for all of us. Adamastor looms. Do we have what it takes to face the terror of our future? I honestly don’t know. But I think we have got to look up from our phones and start paying attention! That sign, “Yes, life is good,” feels a little less comforting.
No wonder for me this tattered yet pretty city never gets old. Just when I think I know my way around, Lisbon confronts me with a big existential question.

Lisbon may not be the first city that comes to mind for most people wanting to visit a European capital. However, don’t let this be a reflection on what the city has to offer. On the contrary, having been asked for pointers quite a few times over the years, I’ve decided to compile a list of 7 things that are off the beaten path, absolutely worth doing should you visit or live there. These should give you a small taste of the potential that this three thousand year old city hides.
Lisbon has a 4km long aqueduct built in the 18th century. Many people know of the large arch that cuts across the Alcântara valley:
However, far less well known is the fact that it cuts deep into the city centre, and that you can walk inside it, and see some beautiful monuments on the way. This path is part of the City-wide “Water Museum” that is currently being developed and begins at the “Mãe d’Água”, the largest water reservoir of the structure.
This gorgeous monument offers some great views of the city which I shall not spoil for you here. The next step is to head to nearby Príncipe Real and head underneath the park into another reservoir, the Patriarcal.
This is where you can take a really pleasant guided tour along 4oom of tunnels that pass underneath the streets of the city.
At the time of writing, the tunnels lead all the way to the São Pedro de Alcântara view point, where you can join other tourists. However, the city is currently expanding the length of tunnels accessible by foot.
Portugal does not have a rich history of beer. The Portuguese are well known for their love of wine, having some of the best bottles in the world produced there, and the Portuguese culture is built much more around wine that it is around beer. It is quite ordinary to see people drinking wine at lunch and dinner rather than beer, as is more common in Northern and Eastern Europe. Having said that, Lisbon and Oporto have jumped on the craft beer bandwagon with roaring success, and these local delicacies can be enjoyed at a variety of places throughout the capital. There is a great list of places here which I will summarise:
Update: Check out Musa in Marvila.
The reason Lisbon was built in its current location, and one of the main factors of its historical prominence, is the Tagus river delta. The Tagus is the longest river in the Iberian peninsula and its enormous reverse-delta is home to dolphins, flamingos and amazing views over the city. One of the best things to do in the city is to hop on a sail-boat and do a 2 hour cruise of the delta at sunset.
Lisbon is quite unique in comparison to the other European capitals when it comes to museums. You won’t find a Louvre, National Gallery, or Prado here. What you will find however, is a large amount of excellent small to mid-sized museums all over the city, catering to every taste. I’ll spare the reader another long list and link to this blog which has a comprehensive one. To that list I’ll add a couple more that should be at the top of your list:
2. Under-dogs Gallery — Lisbon’s best street art gallery. It doesn’t limit itself to just street art, however:
Lisbon’s music scene is UGE as some might say. The city offers a regular serving of all types of genres, scenes and festivals all year round. The centuries-old multicultural environment has always been a fertile ground for original music output, and you can hear European, Brazilian, African, Indian and SE Asian music scenes come together in a setting unmatched anywhere else in the world.
A few highlights:
Venues:
Labels:
Events:
Special mention to this wine bar located inside one of the watering holes that used to quench the city’s thirst. Incidentally, it’s one of the end points of the aforementioned aqueduct, although this stretch isn’t accessible to the public (maybe try asking the owners of the wine bar).
With the largest amount of sunlight hours per year of any European capital, it’s only natural that Lisbon’s sunsets would live up to the city’ sunny reputation. Great spots to enjoy these are:
Equally stunning are the sunrises from some of the nightclubs like Lux.
—
I hope this brief list gives you some idea of the huge amount of things to do there. If you have any more tips or have specific questions, feel free to leave them in the comments!

Just a short flight from London is the city of Lisbon. The Portuguese capital has become hugely popular lately as a travel destination. With cute architecture, delicious cuisine and gorgeous views, it is no wonder why so many people are stopping by. A few days in Lisbon is a welcomed break, with sunshine and lots to see, do and eat. A perfect place for a weekend getaway!
Located on the West side of Portugal, the city’s airport is a travel hub for those flying in. In fact, I was surprised by the large size of the airport and the number of flights coming in from London, the rest of Europe and the States. TAP Portugal are aggressively expanding but has been relatively less heard of in the travel world. I was pleasantly surprised by the flights to and from London and would recommend flying with them when planning your visit it Lisbon. Added bonus is that the airline’s flight crew has been named most handsome crew!
Top tip for booking flights is to use sites such as Kayak to find the best deals.
Once you have landed, get yourself an Uber (referral) or try out Kapten (code) and head towards your hotel. Lisbon is a relatively small city, so a cab ride into the city is pretty affordable and quick! I am a big fan of using Airbnb when I travel and was so glad to have done so in Lisbon! I stayed at Joanna’s flat, where I had a large, comfortable and artsy room, in the quiet back streets of the city. It gave me a real taste of living like a local, where the hosts gave me loads of tips and recommendations. Their dogs and cats were super friendly too!
For those who haven’t had their first Airbnb experience, what are you waiting for?! Give it a go in Lisbon and you won’t be disappointed. Make sure to use my referral code and do loads of research on the property before you book. Those who have had bad experiences tend to forget to checkout the comments, reviews and photos! For those looking for more traditional accommodation, make sure to use sites like Booking.com, Agoda and even Hostelworld to get the best deals. Hotels are all pretty affordable in Lisbon, so choose one that is central and looks comfortable!
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -
Start your visit with a trip to the Time Out Market, an enormous food market in the centre of town serving up some unique and delicious dishes. The food hall is packed with restaurants and stalls, serving up some of the most incredible seafood, cold cut meats and delicious local dishes! Do be mindful that during peak hours, it might take a while to get a seat and table. Make sure to check out the store that only sells canned food!
Lisbon is famously known as the City of Seven Hills. This means that pretty much every corner or street you walk down, you will somehow end up walking up one of the hills. This also means that there are numerous lookout points around the city that all offer some incredible views! There is something mesmerizing about those tiled roofs, all in that gorgeous orange!
A walk around Lisbon and you will discover endless cute little streets, squares, monuments and beautifully decorated buildings. This makes getting lost a real treat!
For those who don’t fancy too much hill walking, take the famous Tram 28 and go for a little tour around town. It is a great way to get away from the heat while seeing loads of the city.
The best way to get to know a city is through a free walking tour! They are usually run by genuine people who know the city and you will end up only paying for what you want. These are normally tip based services and you quite literally decide how much the tour was worth at the end. I usually look for tours run by Sandeman’s- they are really enjoyable, dynamic and run by fun guides!
The tour gives you a deep understanding of the city’s history, local heroes, top spots and great tips for the rest of your stay in Lisbon. Some of my highlights were the oldest book store in the world, endless squares, the Santa Justa lift and some incredible city stories!
Just outside of the center of Lisbon is the historical area of Belem. You should spend at least half a day or a morning in this area. The first stop would be to get to Pastéis de Belém early in the morning, before the queues start. This is the world most famous bakery shop that sells the best pastel de nata in town. It is freshly made in store and the queue gets really long. So definitely get there for their 8am opening. You cannot beat a hot pastry first thing in the morning, with a nice cup of coffee.
After your heavy and sweet breakfast, you could stop by the Palace and do a quick tour, or check out the Jerónimos Monastery. I skipped the Palace and headed for the later, where I was met with a grand looking building with incredible interiors. This monastery was opened in 1495 and still has regular services.
The last part of the morning in Belem would be a nice gentle stroll down the riverside. You will first see Padrão dos Descobrimentos, a monument representing the concept of Portuguese exploration.
It is such a nice little walk along the river, with plenty of cafes and restaurants to sit at and people watch. Before you know it, you will have reached the Belem Tower, a medieval defensive tower that is worth stopping for photos. What a nice morning spent in Belem!
This neighborhood in central Lisbon is worth exploring and wondering around. It has this really nice vibe to it, with low buildings and lots of bars! Definitely a spot to pop by for some drinks! Wine lovers have to head to BA Wine Bar — this is a cute little spot serving up some great local wines!
One of the best things I managed to experience in Lisbon was an intimate Fado performance. Fado is a music genre from 1820s and usually played by a small band with some very intense singing and usually portraying some very emotional and sad events. The songs are all in Portuguese but you can really feel the emotions from the music and the singing alone. It is an experience really worth having! So much emotion. I would suggest heading to Mascote da Atalaia in Barrio Alto the day before to book a spot for dinner the next day. The food is decent, there is this amazing sparkling white wine on tap and the music is just completely out of the world!
The last area of Lisbon worth mentioning is Alfama. During the day, the tiny and cobbled streets are filled with old grandmas shouting at each other and having a good time. At night, it is where all the bars and parties are at! This former red light district was ironically the only area in the whole of Lisbon that did not get destroyed during the last massive earthquake! You can walk down the streets at night and head into any bar, fado or restaurant, to really get a taste of Lisbon’s night life!
One of my favorite travel shows is Somebody Feed Phil. This short series is really centered around places to eat and is based around a city per episode. When Phil was in Lisbon, there was one restaurant that I just knew I had to go check out — Ponto Final. A short ferry ride from the centre of Lisbon and you will be on the other side, with some of the best views of the city. About a 15 minute walk along the waters and you will come across this cute little restaurant literally on the side of the water! Make sure to call well in advance if you want a table on the edge. It is definitely worth it, especially with the view of the whole of Lisbon. Perfect while you feast on the freshest seafood ever — grilled fish, octopus and all. I spent a ridiculous amount of time here for lunch (3 hours!). It was so relaxing with incredible food and great wine too! A definite must when in Lisbon.
For more traditional Portuguese or local food, there are two decent spots in town. One is Taberna da Rua das Flores, a super cute and artisan tavern-like contemporary restaurant. The food was seasonal, with black boards as menu. The staff are nice enough to point out each dish in detail and recommended things to try. Its like Portuguese tapas, sharing small plates and trying lots of different things! The dim lighting and vibe makes this place really intimate for dates as well!
Word of caution — this place is very popular! I went at around 6pm and was asked to come back 1.5 hours later! It is a small place and it is fair enough. Pop your name down and then head next door to By The Wine for some quality local wines and snacks.
For a more traditional setting, try out Casa do Alentejo. This is an old palace that was built around the 17th century and contains some beautiful mosaics and interior designs. Finding the spot was a bit challenging but once inside from the busy high street, you enter into a tranquil courtyard and get absolutely transported into some Spanish or Moorish setting. I spent some time walking around just to see the place! The stairs and the interior were all really well designed and preserved.
Food was served upstairs and consisted of great local dishes from the Alentejo region, with the likes of lamb stews, pork loins and rabbit. What makes this place so special is the dining hall. One of the most incredibly designed places I have eaten at!
Peri Peri What? How can you come to Portugal and not try out the famous Peri Peri chicken? Rumour has it that Frangasqueira Nacional has the best chicken in town. This little take out spot is famous for the meat and runs out of chicken on most days! I was so looking forward to this but only to find out that it was closed on a bank holiday! Feeling gutted, I walked aimless around the empty streets to find an alternative. Luckily, I walked into a little park with a small spot for dinner. In a green house like building is Esplanada Cafe. This is such a cute spot with large open windows and is a perfect place to sit and sip wine and enjoy some gorgeous chicken! One of the most relaxed evenings I had in Lisbon!
Lisbon was such a lovely city to explore and enjoy. This is a perfect destination for a long weekend. Spend a few days in the city and you will be eating great seafood, getting lost in beautiful architecture and learning so much about the history and life of this great city! Stay tuned for my next post — a day trip to Sintra!
Haven’t got that almighty travel backpack? Or in the market looking for the best mini suitcase? I got you covered with some of my go to travel essentials:

Posted: 10/28/2021 | October 28th, 2021
When I first went to Lisbon in 2012, I immediately fell in love with it. Hilly, colorful, beautiful, and full of wonderful food — it was everything I wanted. And the fact that it was very inexpensive didn’t hurt either.
Pre-COVID, Lisbon’s secret got out. Tourists flocked here in droves, and it became a magnet for digital nomads. While the crowds are greater and the prices are higher than before, Lisbon’s charm hasn’t been fully lost. The food scene is still excellent (and underrated if you ask me). The bars are lively. And the street scene is always intoxicatingly fun.
Plus, compared to other capitals in Europe, Lisbon is still a bargain.
The city’s 11 neighborhoods all have their own unique characteristics, providing visitors with a wide variety of locales to choose from. From achingly charming Alfama to the always swinging Bairro Alto, there’s something for everyone.
But before we dive in, here are some of the most common questions I get about Lisbon:
What’s the best neighborhood for budget travelers? Baixa and Rossio are home to many of the city’s hostels, making it a good hub for budget travelers.
What’s the best neighborhood for families? Modern, somewhat futuristic-looking Parque das Nações is loaded with family-oriented attractions, including the Oceanarium, Europe’s largest indoor aquarium.
What’s the best neighborhood for partying? Crammed with tiny bars and restaurants, Bairro Alto is the place to go at night in Lisbon.
What is the best neighborhood, overall? Alfama is a fun place to hang out for a while. It’s old (it survived the big earthquake of 1755) so it still has a timeworn atmosphere. And it’s the best place to pop into a bar to catch a fado concert.
So, with those questions answered, here’s a breakdown of seven neighborhoods with suggested accommodations for each:
Lisbon Neighborhood Overview
Located beneath the walls of São Jorge (St. George) Castle, this hilly medieval district — one of the oldest neighborhoods in Lisbon, along with nearby Alfama — actually means “Moorish Quarter,” because it was once where the Moors resided centuries ago.
Today it has a large Asian population, who go about their daily lives in a neighborhood that oozes with charm and history: its winding cobblestone streets are flanked by medieval buildings. And one of its main historical reputations is that it is the birthplace of fado, a singular Portuguese genre of music that can best described as mesmeric and melancholy.
Best Places to Stay in Mouraria:
There wasn’t much to see here about three decades ago. Then the city deemed this eastern swath the home of Expo ’98, otherwise known as the World’s Fair, and the area was transformed into a modern, somewhat futuristic park. If you’re into contemporary architecture, this is the place for you. If you’re a traveling family, this is also the place for you. The area includes cable cars, Europe’s biggest aquarium, a waterfront promenade (with lots of great public art), and an interactive science museum. It’s also very quiet here.
The Best Places to Stay in Parque das Nações
Literally meaning High or Upper Neighborhood, Bairro Alto oozes with tranquil Portuguese charm. Once the sun goes down, though, the party starts — especially on Friday and Saturday nights, when there are street parties galore. Tiny bars spill out onto the sidewalks, candle-lit eateries serve up local staples, and people everywhere are just in party mode.
During the day, come for the outstanding viewpoints and the awe-inducing Baroque churches. At night, come to wander the narrow 16th-century streets and do a street-party crawl. But don’t wear out the soles of your shoes — jump on the classic funicular (cable car, one of several the city is known for) up or down the hill.
The Best Places to Stay in Bairro Alto
Some of Europe’s most charming neighborhoods include Trastevere in Rome, Mala Strana in Prague, and Montmartre in Paris. Add Alfama to that list. It’s achingly charming, especially when you add in some fado — Portugal’s heartbreaking, melancholic genre of music that you can hear everywhere in Alfama.
The neighborhood was one of the few districts that survived the infamous 1755 earthquake. So, stroll its narrow, hilly streets and get a sense of what pre-quake Lisbon was like. It’s also home to São Jorge Castle, Lisbon Cathedral, and the decorative tile-loaded São Vicente de Fora Monastery.
The Best Places to Stay in Alfama
Translated as “Sodré’s Wharf,” this micro-neighborhood is dominated by the city’s main food market, Mercado da Ribeira, which today is also known as the Time Out Market. It’s a collection of stalls from some of Lisbon’s best restaurants and food purveyors and the place to go for food-loving travelers. The streets surrounding the market are flanked by various bars and restaurants, and street parties break out here seemingly 24/7.
At night, don’t miss Pink Street, a pink-painted pedestrian street teeming with fun-loving people every night of the week.
The Best Places to Stay in Cais do Sodré
This is the river meets history, where Vasco de Gama and Christopher Columbus embarked and disembarked. It’s where Portugal’s one-time powerful empire set sail for the rest of the world. Today Belém is an aesthetically pleasing part of town that is also crammed with great museums. Be sure to check out the Museum of Art, Architecture, and Technology (MAAT), the Berardo Collection, the Folk Art Museum, the National Archeology Museum, and the Maritime Museum, not to mention the Jerónimos Monastery.
Also, next to the monastery is Pastéis de Belém, one of the best/busiest places in the city to get the famous pastéis de nata (egg custard tart).
Best Places to Stay in Belém:
It’s not officially a neighborhood, but this long avenue has its very own vibe. Need some designer shoes? A designer handbag? A designer anything? This is the area to shop ’til you drop. The long and wide Champs-Élysées-like street is also a lovely place to stroll. And it’s all very parklike. While the verdant Avenida is bustling at times because of the traffic, it can be very tranquil too.
Where to Stay on Avenida da Liberdade:
These two neighborhoods make up much of the city’s main tourist core. Lined with pedestrian streets, there is a lot of Neoclassical architecture here, built after the massive earthquake in 1755. There are tons of eateries, as well as tacky souvenir shops to browse around the district, and the popular Museum of Contemporary Art can also be found here. Be sure to spend some time strolling around the popular Commerce Square.

Lisbon is a fascinating and underrated metropolis. It gets much less attention than other Western European capitals, but I think it should be on everyone’s must-see list. And if you’ve already been, put it on your must-see-again list. It’s worth it.

How to spend few days in Lisbon without rushing but enjoying the city and working a bit
I visited Lisbon a few days ago. I wasn’t planning much beforehand, went to places as I felt for it. I read few blog posts about Lisbon and Portugal in general but did not had much expectations other than it’s cool city and I will have fun for sure. I knew a few friends that were in Lisbon whom I wanted to meet with otherwise had not much of a plans. I got recommendations for a very few spots to see but I used google maps for the most of the things.
I met some crypto people at The Block Cafe which is hosting networking event every Friday from 6pm, search for it on meetup.com for more info.
I bought the first day metro card at the machine at subway and used it pretty lot during the day. Metro is super clean and safe although I didn’t felt for riding it in night as the taxi is pretty cheap. For taxi I was using Bolt which is European version of Uber and it works great, the taxi is cheap and it was usually around 5€ for like 2–3km ride which is not that bad. Even taxi to the airport was around 10€ which is amazing.
I wasn’t really aiming to go to places but I wanted to have fun. I havent been to many places as I was working in the morning and spend some time hanging out at friends places. Here’s list of places that I’ve been to:
It’s Portugal and so food experience is very unique, in terms of there’s so many pretty bad restaurants or just super basic ones that are okay but you want to get the experience. I’ve been always eating out but here’s my list of fav places that I kept coming back to or I visited and was just blown away. I did not eat at many places as I was eating lot of pastel de nata.
I just love them and last days I was eating like 6–8 a day just because it’s love (don’t judge me plz). My rank of pastel de nata based on how much i liked them. Here is my rank:
I think I will just keep coming back to Brasileira as its in a great location.
Lisbon has some nice rooftop restaurants and bars. Here are the ones that I visited and loved them!
I had nice time in Lisbon and I hope you will have too, just be ready for slow down. Lisbon is very slow city and everything takes for ever. You will experience it in restaurants, be patient. If you want just quick food fast ask for takeout and pay immediately.
I did not added links to the places as you can just google them using google maps. I also created Lisbon must visit highlight on my Instagram profile with pictures from these places. Follow me on Instagram for more adventures @anett.rolikova

When we began planning to relocate to Portugal in 2022, I was excited for the opportunity to ditch my car and use public transit — especially trains — to get around.
And for the most part that's what we've done: we don't own a car, and we get around the center of Lisbon by public transit, with the occasional bit of frustration when a bus arrives late or a metro carriage is packed to the brim with commuters.
Comboio Portugal's trains can get you around most of Portugal without too much difficulty, but we were disappointed to discover that there were no easy routes out of Portugal and into Spain — much less into the greater continental system of trains that crisscross Europe.
But what do I mean by an ""easy route?""
The main issue is that — due to a limited number of train schedules — it is not possible to travel from one end of the peninsula to the other without an overnight stay somewhere near the middle. The limited number of departures — and indeed the speed of the route itself — mean that it's not possible to do even if you catch the first train out of Lisbon or Barcelona early in the morning.
Badajoz is a Spanish city in the ancient and contested border region of Extremadura (Estremoz in Portuguese). It’s a medium-sized city that seems to be well-accommodated, with historical relevance dating back to pre-Roman times.
But key to our attention is the fact that Badajoz is the current nexus of Portugal's train service, Comboio Portugal, and Spain's primary rail carrier, Renfe. Here the two services join at a small but functional station.
But your problems originating from Lisbon actually begin before you reach Badajoz, at a small city in Santarém called Entroncamento.
Entroncamento is where the relatively-fast Intercidades train service from Lisboa Oriente switches to the slow, frequently-stopping Regional service from Comboio Portugal. There are no direct trains from Lisbon to Badajoz, and you must switch at Entroncamento, with the same being true going the other direction.
The Regional service from Entroncamento is on a small, two-carriage train that makes 16 stops along the way and takes almost 3 hours to make the journey between Entroncamento and Badajoz. It's not entirely uncomfortable, but it is not fast, and the stops are frequent. But they are also some of the most charming stops along the route, and they offer some of the most beautiful vistas of Portugal's interior.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is likewise beautiful. It's accomplished on Renfe's Alvia service, and is much more comfortable than the journey between Badajoz and Entroncamento. The Alvia has comfortable, assigned seats, air conditioning, and a cafeteria car. It's much more like the Comboio Portugal Intercidades service, and it offers gorgeous views of Spain's snow-capped Sierra de Gredos mountains.
Gazing out the window of either the Renfe or CP trains, it's easy to imagine the Iberian countryside of Hemingway's cock and bull stories — gentle brooks that wind past the ruins of old stone fences, among low-slung green hills dotted with the outlines of black bulls and cork trees. This scene blends uninterrupted on either side of the border for a 100km stretch, making it impossible to know which country you're in.
On the Portuguese side of the line, I saw a farmer with a plow yoked to a mule, manually plowing the soil with equipment that Iberian farmers have used for a thousand years. I could barely believe my eyes.
Our goal is to reach Barcelona, and we don't mind leaving on the earliest train out of Lisboa Oriente. And in all of our scenarios we will select the fastest services available.
That will be the 07:39 AM Intercidades (IC) departing from Lisboa's Oriente station. Oriente is a lovely station that's easy to navigate and can be reached from the Lisbon Metro's red line. The IC ride from Oriente to Entroncamento is the shortest leg of the entire journey, clocking in at a little under an hour and placing you there by 08:30 AM assuming everything goes right (it often does not on Comboio Portugal).
Here you have a few moments to top off snacks and water and locate your train to Badajoz. The Entroncamento station is pretty spartan and has limited facilities, so it's really best to get anything you'll need for the entire stretch to Badajoz before you leave Oriente.
In Entroncamento, you switch trains onto the slow-rolling and frequently-stopping Regional service departing at 09:06 AM. This train has two cars and unassigned bench seating. It's far from comfortable and at 3 hours it can be a test of patience.
By the time you roll into Badajoz at 12:54 PM you will have lost an hour crossing the Spanish border.
You will also need to find some way to occupy several hours, as the next train departing for Madrid is at 05:43 PM on Renfe's Alvia service.
Here is where a key decision emerges on your trip from Lisbon to Barcelona — spend a long evening and night in Badajoz, waking the next morning to catch the first train to Madrid at 08:16 AM, or continue on to Madrid, arriving at 10:39 PM, where you will spend the night and have many options for reaching Barcelona the following day. Your choice basically comes down to: where would I rather sleep?
The good news, I suppose, is that 10:39 PM is a perfectly acceptable time to find a meal in Spain, where dinners often do not begin until 9:00 PM or later. But if you are already tired, Badajoz seems to have plenty to offer and — at least as far as I can tell — would not be a bad place to spend the night. And spending the night here would certainly allow you to eventually roll into Barcelona a little earlier in the day.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is a little under 5 hours whether you take the 08:16 AM or the 05:43 PM, but it is comfortable, with the Alvia offering assigned seats and both 1st and 2nd class carriages. There is a well-equipped cafeteria car and frequent trips up and down the aisles by the food cart.
Assuming that you decided to spend the night in Badajoz and take the 08:16 AM Alvia the following morning, you would arrive in Madrid a little past noon, and would then have many options for traveling on to Barcelona. All of them can be on Renfe's AVE high speed rail service, which was slightly nicer than the Alvia service and comparable to Comboio Portugal's Alfa Pendular high speed service.
This is the route I actually took a few weeks back. It was long — and I made the trip hung over from a night of drinking with colleagues in Barcelona — but it got me home.
As with the trip originating in Lisbon, we want to get as far as possible in a given day, so we don't mind leaving early. During my trip a few weeks ago, I intentionally chose a later train as I knew the earliest train out — at 5:50 AM — would be too early for me, and as we'll see in a moment, sacrificing sleep to get out as early as possible is not going to do anything for getting home faster when going west.
The AVE service is nice and fast, with comfortable seats that you can select in first and second class. I bought a first class seat because I wanted to be as comfortable as possible with a belly full of last night's cocktails — not that it helped much as the train jostled from side-to-side as it chugged slowly out of the ancient Catalonian principality.
The countryside here looks a lot different than it does coming from the west, but during this time of the year it was beautiful. Fruit orchards (I couldn't tell if they were cherries, plums, peaches, or some other variety of stone fruit blossoms) were in full bloom, creating rows of pink and white blossoms that striped the countryside all the way to Madrid.
The AVE service should drop you in Madrid at a very respectable 9:10 AM. But the problem is that on most days, there are only two trains departing Madrid for Badajoz: 8:30 AM and 4:17PM. And you've already missed one of them.
So you must again ask yourself where you'd prefer to spend the night.
Even though it feels like you haven't made it very far, there's a strong case to be made for spending an evening in Madrid vs. Badajoz. Madrid is a major city with many restaurants and attractions that can be used to blow your time. It's almost worth it just to exit the train station here so you can see the beautiful edificio of Madrid's Puerta de Atocha railway station. But there are also museums, parks, the botanical gardens, and more just a short distance from the station.
I chose to spend the night in Madrid and got a small room near the train station so that I could pull out on the first train to Badajoz the next morning. Given the hangover, I did not do any sightseeing. But you're smarter than me and won't have that particular problem. Right? I did eat some of the worst croquettes I've ever had that night.
Sorry Spain — Portugal's are just better.
That first train leaves at 8:30 AM, and at least for me, navigating the train station was a little confusing, so I suggest leaving yourself enough time to figure out how to get to the right train. The arrival and departure terminals are in separate buildings, so make sure you go to the right one.
The Alvia train to Badajoz is fine, with all of the amenities you need to be comfortable, but with slightly less-comfortable seats than the AVE even in first class. It speeds along just south of Spain's Sierra de Gredos mountains. With their snow-capped peaks, they make for a gorgeous backdrop to the aforementioned cow pastures and cork trees. It's a little like Texas hill country, but with some very serious hills.
By the time you reach Badajoz at 1:34 PM in the afternoon you will have made a 5 hour haul across the Iberian peninsula, but it places you in Badajoz with enough time to catch the trains on to Lisbon, where you will pick up an hour as you cross the border.
The first train to Portugal departs at 2:09 PM in the afternoon, so you have a bit of time to get snacks and water before moving on. If you miss it, there's another train to Lisboa Oriente station at 7:41 PM, but it obviously puts you in Lisbon much later at night (after 10:00 PM). This may not matter as much for a tourist, but as I was eager to get home to my family, my calculations were always focused on getting home as early in the day as possible.
Both services require taking the slow moving Regional service to Entroncamento — the reverse of what I described in the first westward-bound trip — and switch to an Intercidades service for the final leg of the journey to Lisbon's Oriente Station.
The Regional service to Entroncamento sits on an inconspicuous track that's on the perimeter of the main platforms. It's clearly labeled as a Comboio Portugal train, and when we arrived I assumed it was the train I needed to board. But we were made to enter the terminal anyway, and not permitted to re-enter the platform until its scheduled departure.
The Regional service to Entroncamento also departed late, but the conductor mostly made up the time during the trip. It was interesting to observe the people getting on and off along this route. Many of its stops were extremely rural, and I saw a mixture of different commuters: cyclists fully-decked in their cycling gear who brought bicycles aboard and got off after a few stops, grannies with grocery bags in either hands who rode the train for just one stop, and younger folks who looked like they were taking the full ride for a weekend of partying in Lisbon. Sometimes the conductor stepped out to help the older passengers on or off the train with their grocery bags or boxes, and it was easy to imagine that this cast of regulars were people he knew well and saw multiple times a week.
We arrived about 10 minutes late and discovered that CP had held the outbound train to Lisbon, allowing us to board and make the 4:52 PM arrival time in Lisbon.
This was much to the current passengers' consternation, but much to my relief and gratitude.
While I'm glad I made the cross-peninsular trip by train, it's not something I would want to do regularly. Nor, perhaps, would I want to do it with a large family and lots of luggage in tow.
But if you have a few days to burn and nowhere better to be, and you don't mind a slow moving tour of the Iberian countryside, this is an excellent option.
I should point out that overall the cost of the trip was actually comparable to a round-trip airline ticket. The Portuguese leg of the trip comes out to about €25 one way. The leg between Portugal and Madrid is another €45. And a first class ticket on the AVE between Madrid and Barcelona, in either direction, comes out to about €119. This is all in one direction.
If cost is your limiting factor — and especially travel time — air travel makes more sense.
But there are plenty of good reasons to take the train if you can: reduced environmental impact, the ability to get up and walk around to stretch your legs and take in views, choices for food and drink in the cafeteria cars, and beautiful views of the countryside are all compelling reasons to consider travel-by-train. And while the trains (at least in Spain) require you to run your bags through a screening process, it was nothing compared to the headache that is air travel in the year 2025.
I'd like to see more options for getting places by rail, so I try to take the trains whenever it's feasible. My hope is that the more we use trains, the more countries see the demand for expanded routes and increased optimization in existing routes.
While I might not take this route frequently, I'm at least comfortable in the implications that it brings and can pack and plan accordingly. And if you believe the hype, plans are in the works to bring high speed service between Lisbon and Madrid. If accomplished, this would result in something like 3 hours of travel time between the peninsula's capitals and would make getting on to Barcelona in a day an easy feat.
But I'm afraid the Portuguese cynicism for major works like this has already worn me down, and I'm not expecting this to be the case any time soon.
Even if I don't plan on going from coast to coast, I know I can make it from capital to capital in a single day, and that's a thing I might try to do more often now that I've done it once.
And maybe at some point, I'll make the cross-peninsula trek and just keep going — into France and the heart of Europe. But that's a feat for someone with way more time on their hands than me right now.

When you think of finding your way around in places that are unknown, you rely on GPS and your phone to help you get there. Back in 2016, when I was exploring Lisboa (Lisbon), Portugal, I found myself in the Alfama district. It’s one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city and possibly one of the most confusing places you could be in.
As I walked through the neighborhood, I found myself lost in a seemingly endless maze of narrow, winding staircases and hidden alleys. Without the help of GPS or the internet, I had to rely on my sense of direction to find my way around. Turns out, that sense was non-existent.
Despite feeling completely disoriented, exploring Alfama was an adventure in itself. Around every turn, I found unexpected surprises: charming courtyards, hidden plazas, and laundry drying in the sun. It was like I had stepped back in time, and I was happy to be lost in this labyrinth.
Eventually, I managed to find my way back to civilization, but I wouldn’t have regretted getting lost in Alfama. Navigating through the district’s twisting streets turned out to be a memorable experience.
Exploring Alfama district is an unforgettable experience of getting lost in a labyrinthine of narrow streets and it’s one of the most interesting neighborhood designs I’ve ever seen. After all, getting lost in such an ancient area is not a bad thing, but a chance to explore its wonders one inch at a time.

Lisbon is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and Portugal’s main centre of education, economy and culture. Its picturesque alleys of Bairro Alto and the fancy boulevards from Rossio to Tejo are just a fraction of places to go and see during the day. And by night, you’ll hear traditional Fado tunes coming out of every bar, inviting you to join the vibrant nightlife. Lisbon’s atmosphere is overall an exciting mix of fast-paced city life and Mediterranean flair that provides the needed balance between work and life.
But when you go off the usual streets and places full of tourists, you may experience a whole different side of Lisbon, one that isn’t mentioned in any common guide and for outsiders quite difficult to access. Without knowing the right places beforehand, it’s practically invisible. I talk about Lisbon’s rising underground scene of secret Chinese restaurants.
“You probably mean the „illegal“ Chinese. There are three of them close to Martim Moniz. One at the end of the street Beco da Oliveira and two are in a building in street Rua do Terreirinho (number 40 if I remember correctly).” — Henning, Erasmus Student from Lisbon on Hubble
The most prominent spot for such restaurants is around the metro station Martim Moniz in the neighborhood of Mouraria. They are often hidden in apartment buildings and back alleys, and the more you proceed into the side streets of Mouraria, the creepier it gets.
“I’m not pretty sure about the name of the restaurant but I think it is Chinês Clandestino. As the name says, it is a clandestine restaurant, so it’s like a secret spot to have a nice meal. Here you have the address: Mouraria — Rua da Guia, 9, 2 Dto, Mouraria, Lisboa. Have fun!” — Daniela, World Citizen on Hubble
The friendly and colorful Lisbon you once knew (well, a few minutes ago) is gone. Streets are plastered with garbage instead of the azure blue Azulejo tiles. Now, heated discussions in all kinds of languages come in place of the relaxing, traditional melodies from the Old Town. You would love nothing more than to turn around, hop onto the metro back to Bairro Alto and quickly forget about your unsuccessful adventure, but the goal is already within your reach. You can’t go back now, can you?
“There are two in Rua do Benformoso 59. Just knock on the door on the 1st floor or try the one on the 2nd floor.” — Nanxi, Foodie on Hubble
You wind up standing in front of a slightly rundown house. The door is open most of the time and leads to a dark hallway. It feels like you’re in a movie…No, not the one’s with a happy ending. You dare to go upstairs. The smell of food fills your nose but the fear of getting kidnapped and waking up tomorrow without a kidney is the only thing you can think of.
Nervously, you read the number of the apartment where you have to go from a little, crumpled-up piece of paper which you got from your Airbnb host. It’s the right place. You gather all your courage and knock on the door. You regret it, why did you even come here, you should have gone to McDonal — … Suddenly, an old, Asian lady opens the door and invites you warmly in. Although you don’t understand a word, it feels like everyone is very kind to you. Maybe this isn’t so bad at all. At least your organs are safe.
In the restaurant, it’s a completely different world. A bit modest, but clean, traditional and cozy. A few people are having dinner, others play ancient board games. The old lady sits down and continues to watch a TV show while you proceed to one of the 8 tables in total. There’s no pressure. You sit down, choose a meal and after all the stress you get rewarded with incredible amounts of tasty food at a good price. Regular restaurants have nothing on the unmatched dishes and familiar vibe. It’s like you would eat at your grandparent’s home, well if your grandparents should be from Asia and… I mean you get it.
I can’t recommend those places enough. Instead of going to the same locations over and over again, you should try one of these secret restaurants. It’s an exciting part of everyday life in Lisbon and when you want to see its true nature while having a cheap night-out, this is it!

Like most children, when I was very little, there were things in our house that I was not allowed to touch. Things like the grandfather clock in our living room, which I was told would fall over on me. Or the record player, which I actually did touch, and did break the stylus on, and which never worked again. And of course common dangerous kitchen things like the stove, oven, or kitchen knives.
But of all the things I was not allowed to touch, the weirdest and seemingly most harmless one was a small, gray, leather-bound case that my mom kept in her room. It was about the same size as one of our encyclopedias, but thinner, and had a handle for carrying. The brass latches kept both sides of the case firmly closed. At the time, it felt like the perfect child-sized suitcase for pretending I was going on a trip somewhere. “Aloha! I’m off to Hawaii with my cool little suitcase!”, I might’ve pretended. Except that I definitely was not allowed to use this little case as a prop.
But within this tantalizing little case was something special to my mom. Something she worried I would either damage, or lose the pieces to, or spill something on, or maybe she just thought I’d swallow a piece. It was a backgammon board; a game my mom would later reveal to me in the hopes of having a partner for playing. But she would be disappointed, as it turned out, because backgammon is kind of confusing for a kid.
While we tried to play a few times, most of our games ended in mutual frustration, and for the time being I decided backgammon was boring and not something I wanted to learn to play.
The trajectory of gaming for me was not a straight line from my first encounter with backgammon to rediscovering it decades later. As a kid I played a lot of the basic Milton Bradley and Parker Bros. stuff — Monopoly, Trouble, Guess Who, Clue — and as I entered my junior high years I began playing tabletop role playing games. During weekends in high school, I would go to a tennis meet, then head to a friend’s house at Fort Polk where half of our team would engage in UNO or Risk and the occasional groan-inducing session of Axis and Allies.
It wasn’t until I was in early college, and I met my friend Lyle, that I got into what were then called “European-style board games”: Ticket to Ride, Puerto Rico, Game of Thrones, and more. The vast world of tabletop gaming — with its myriad choices of engines, strategies, settings, and pleasant little game pieces — opened up to me and hooked me. It was revelatory.
After I got married in 2010, I introduced my wife to the world of adult board games, and she got into them as well. By 2012, we were hosting weekly game nights at our house in Atlanta. My wife would prepare a delicious meal for everyone, and we’d kick things off with a warmup game like Citadels, Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards (we lovingly call this game Wizards of Skullfuck Mountain because none of us could be bothered to remember the name), or something else that played quickly. Then we’d eat, and get into the real main course — a good multiplayer board game— which might last for 2–3 hours.
This went on for many years until the complications of life finally intruded on everyone, and we had a kid.
Around the same time in 2012, I was being introduced to the ancient Asian strategy game of Go by a coworker. I was fascinated by the simplicity of the game, but continuously challenged by its complex strategies. At this point I was mostly dabbling — we’d play a few games on a mobile app each week, but eventually I changed jobs, we lost touch, and I didn’t think about Go for a while.
Then in 2014, I got an itch to play Go again, and got a physical Go board and pieces and brought them to work. I sat it on my desk and friends and I would take turns playing throughout the day. One day an outside consultant I had hired walked by my desk and noticed our Go board and revealed that he was deeply into Shogi and Go. This let to a renewed interest in Go for myself, and an introduction to the intricacies and deep strategies of Go for some of my coworkers. While some of them got deeply into it (one of them is now the head of Atlanta’s Go Club and a highly-ranked player), I played occasionally but did not invest a lot of time in practicing. Consequently, I am not very good at Go but I still love the game.
Fast forward to 2024. I still love games. And our daughter does too. Among her favorites are Splendor, Azul, Ghost Blitz, and chess. A lot of my free time in Lisbon is spent sitting at the park quiosque reading, writing, and drinking a cold beer on a nice day. While the kid runs circles around the quiosque with her friends climbing trees and playing tag, my wife and I sit at the quiosque’s small tables making small talk, looking at our phones, or planning out the week’s activities. Sometimes friends join us, and when they do there is plenty of good conversation to keep our brains occupied. But when it's just us, it's nice to have something to do beyond just chatting.
This got me thinking about small games to occupy ourselves. It's not unusual to see people playing cards, but I don't love the way cards occupy your hands, and I honestly don't really enjoy most of the two-player card games. I thought about Go, but I have consistently failed to get my wife interested in Go, and with its hundreds of small pieces, it could make for a real mess if the kit came open accidentally or a pigeon decided that one of the pieces looked particularly tasty. Then I thought about dice, but I don't know any simple games involving dice.
But then a thought entered my mind: what about backgammon?
Backgammon has its own portable case and is available in very small form-factors.
Backgammon is for two players.
Backgammon has limited pieces to lose.
Backgammon has a relaxed pace, and allows your hands to be free to smoke or drink.
But what I couldn't remember is anything about playing it, so I started doing some reading and watching some videos and realized that backgammon was actually pretty easy to learn, but that there was ample room for strategy. Things clicked and finally fell into place for me, and I thought that I'd like to order a small backgammon set to try.
I found what appeared to be a nice, travel-sized set on Amazon Espanha: a travel set from Yellow Mountain. As we had a trip coming up to Alcaide for the Festa de Cogumelos, I knew my wife and I would have an opportunity to play for a few days: during our time relaxing at the hotel.
For two people on the move wanting to learn to play, it was a good set. The Yellow Mountain set is probably overpriced, but it’s nice for anyone looking for a travel-sized board. When fully opened it lays flat on a table, has a felt game board, and the checkers are magnetized, making it easier to keep up with them. It comes with a set of backgammon rules. My only real complaint is that the miniature dice feel cheap, and that the magnetized checkers sometimes make them hard to stack.
After our arrival at the hotel, we sat in the lounge and played for several hours while we had drinks and snacks. I explained the basics of the game to my wife and she quickly caught on.
Since then, we’ve played hours of backgammon while we're at the quiosque, but we have also started playing more at home. We are having a great time challenging each other and figuring things out for ourselves. It’s so nice to have an interesting, casual game to play while we hang out at the quiosque. I’m looking forward to having it this coming spring and summer.
And there's a lot of strategy that we have yet to discover. We didn't begin using the doubling cube — a dice that effectively lets both players bet on the outcome of the game in order to win more points — though we eventually added it into play and have slowly started to increase the number of points needed to win a game (we're up to 9 points now). But the doubling cube absolutely adds another element of strategy to the game.
Neither of us has yet to score a gammon or backgammon, which occurs when one player manages to ""bear off"" all of their pieces out of their home board before the other player has a single piece in. Most of our games wind up being very close, and I'm confident there are strategies we are overlooking for blocking each other from scoring. The defining moment of each game is always when one of us gets our last piece past the last opponent on the board, at which time it becomes a race to bear off all of our pieces.
For Christmas, my wife bought me a nice, handmade home board from a Greek company called Manopoulos — it's gorgeous and the pieces and game board are so satisfying to hold and touch! It's too big for the quiosque, but that's okay. It's a wonderful board to use at home and we look for any opportunity to pull it out and play a few rounds. It’s something that will be in our family for years.
And you know what? I’ll probably let my daughter touch it, though thus far she has shown little interest in backgammon after watching us play many rounds.
I’m glad I remembered that little suitcase from my childhood, and that my mom at least tried teaching me a game that — although I didn’t find interesting at the time — I would remember later in life. It at least made backgammon a possibility in my mind and made it an option to consider when I was looking for a casual, portable, strategic, two-player boardgame.
I think my mom would be happy to know that I rediscovered backgammon and learned how to play. And I'm glad I did! The gameplay is the perfect pace for nice days at the quiosque.
And when she eventually returns to Lisbon for a visit, I look forward to surprising her with my knowledge of backgammon, and playing a few games with her at the quiosque over a cold beer.

21st August 2013 Lisbon, Portugal
The ship’s engine whirled, shook and rattled to a stop as outside, the crew scuttled about to pull thick ropes around the metal structures on Lisbon’s port to hold the cruise ship in place for the day. The sun’s rays enveloped the entire city from the top of the mountains, over brightly-coloured houses all in pastel, before reaching over one magnificent church standing tall at sea level.
“Lisbon was a city full of history and culture. Many buildings and markets were kept as it was a hundred years before, portraying the old ways of life.”
We went ashore after having breakfasted on the ship and rode a century-old tram around different city quarters, with assurance from the driver that this tram line was used as regular transportation in the city.
The tram climbed up steep hills and slid down narrow alleyways as if following a secret passageway that only our driver knew of. We passed the old quarter with houses worn down and looking like slums, but still had beautiful glazed tiles in their façade that were used immensely as decoration in the olden days, giving blue, green, turquoise and red patterns to entire buildings, making them stand out from their plain, pastel-coloured neighbours.
As the tram rattled past the main train station, it occurred to me why the architecture looked a little bit like home. Coming from Thailand, I was familiar with the fact that Portuguese culture influenced a lot of Thai culture during the time of King Rama V (in the 19th century), where the King had commissioned Portuguese architects to design many buildings during the time of his reign. One of the locals explained that the king of Thailand indeed came to visit Lisbon once, meeting the King of Portugal in the very same train station that our tram moved past.
We reached a huge open square surrounded by magnificent white columns of the city’s biggest theatre, the monument of King John of Lisbon atop a horse, as well as the palace walls that ran along the length of the square. The tram stopped long enough for all of us to have a glass of port wine and a Portuguese egg tart (pastéis de nata).
“Port was traditionally drank after a meal in Portugal, a habit taken up by the British people, but twisted by the French: they enjoyed their glass of the sweet red port as an aperitif before meals.”
This Portuguese pastry was also familiar to us Thais — creamy egg tart with a consistency similar to that of crème brulée, encased in a crispy, flaked pastry shell sold at the side of the roads. But the Portuguese version has a touch of cinnamon, which gave the tart a special and more complex aroma and flavour. The combination of freshly made, warm egg tart and cool, smooth port is thoroughly enjoyed in Portugal as a breakfast pastry or mid-afternoon snack with coffee.
One of the most famous places to try these gloriously crunchy, buttery tarts in Lisbon is at Pastéis de Belém
A café stood in the corner of the square, where one of the locals pointed out to us that it has been operating there since the 1700s. It was mid-morning, but the café was packed with customers having coffee and a golden, thread-like dessert called Fios de Ovos . Another familiar sight, this dessert is thought by many to originate from Thailand and called Foi-Thong (golden thread), however it was the Portuguese that first made it.
The dessert was another Portuguese delicacy which was shared by many far Eastern cultures when the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, sailed across the Indian Ocean and created a new trade route in the 15th century.
The tram started up again, winding its way down to a huge moastery that stood close to the harbourside, its walls running 500 metres across the gardens in front, close to the sea. If you came to Lisbon, this was a must-see sight as the monastery was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Inside the dome-like structure which loomed high above us, were altars of Jesus Christ and tombs of the king and queen. The main altar was of European influence, with paintings of the Lord, Mother Mary from the Renaissance period, but the tombs of the long-gone royals were supported by Indian elephants, showing further the fascination with Oriental cultures the king of Portugal at the time had. Inside this church also lay the tomb of the explorer Vasco da Gama.
Lisbon is a big city and half a day of exploring was simply not enough.

Situated in one of the most beautiful squares of the world, the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio, most commonly known as Rua Augusta Arch, is the monumental gate that connects Lisbon to Tagus river.
The construction process of this Triumphal Arch, the emblematic finishing element of the buildings that constitute the former Terreiro do Paço, was long and certainly not controversy-free.
Supported by grandiose columns it is topped by a set of sculptures that carries a lot of meaning.
Today it is one of the tourist attractions of the city and a must-visit place for the Portuguese as well as for foreigners, as it provides a stunning 360-degree view over the river and the Pombaline Downtown.
After the devastating earthquake of 1755, it was necessary to rebuild the entire downtown area of the city. For that a team of engineers and architects was formed and was led by minister Marquis of Pombal that under the rules of the Reformist Enlightenment movement created a new modern, rational city with a classic and simple style, the Pombaline Style.
The monumental Praça do Comércio was built over the former Terreiro do Paço. The royal palace that used to exist there since the 16th century and that collapsed was solely symbolically replaced by the equestrian statue of King José I.
The square, composed by buildings with arcades, is perfectly symmetric and has two towers both on the east and west sides, while the south side faces the river and the north side faces the new city. The Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio, the noble entrance of Lisbon, was projected for the north end since the beginning.
The first project, by Eugénio dos Santos, was classic and simple and was approved in 1758. It was a round arch sided by statues in niches, with a triangular pediment and topped by a sculpture set.
In 1762 the architect passed away and was substituted by Carlos Mardel who presented a new proposal. More connected to a baroque model, this proposal replaces the pediment with a tall bell tower and a clock, decorated with pinnacles and flame-shaped sculptural ornaments.
Just like the previous one, this project long awaited its execution, seeing that the economic resources of the kingdom were being destined to more important works.
With time passing by, the political context as well as people’s tastes changed and new ideas arose, which triggered a heated discussion among the people of Lisbon.
Thus, the execution of the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio was successively delayed. First due to the withdrawal of Marquis of Pombal from the government in 1777 and later due to the political and economical instability that resulted from the civil war in the early 1800s.
However, in 1815 the support columns were built and only in 1873 was finally inaugurated the monument projected by Veríssimo José da Costa, a solution that merges the best of the two previous proposals.
From Eugénios dos Santos he chose to include the sculpture sets, as well as the classic lines and balanced proportions; from Carlos Mardel he included the clock and placed it facing north, while the south side features the coat of arms of Portugal. Plus, he added a baroque style with the rococo decoration that surrounds them.
Veríssimo José da Costa kept the already built base but discarded the triangular pediment from the two previous projects, replacing it with a rectangular structure that corresponds to a wide hall, where we can see the clock mechanism, as well as a superb view from both the large lateral windows.
The sculptures present in the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio resulted from an iconographic programme from the French artist Célestin Anatole Calmels (1822–1906). This artist executed, among others, the emblematic works of the Allegories on the sides of the portal of Palmela Palace and the sculpture set of the pediment of the City Council of Lisbon.
On the south side of the arch, the artwork on the top level was executed by the Portuguese romantic sculptor Victor Bastos (1830–1894), author of, among other pieces, the monument of tribute to the poet Luís de Camões, situated in the Square named after him.
They are the colossal allegories of the rivers Tagus (west side) and Douro (east side) on the sides of the building; and two pairs of statues that represent four important figures of the History of Portugal.
While the representations of these same rivers in the statues of Liberdade Avenue are harder to distinguish, here they’re more clearly identified. The statue on the east side features a bunch of grapes, which we immediately associate to the Demarcated Region of Douro, instituted in 1756 during the governance of Pombal. On the opposite side the Tagus seems to have had an object on its hand, but whatever it was is now broken.
When it comes to the statues, from left to right we can find: on the west side, Viriathus (181 BC-139 BC), the mythical leader of Lusitanian people, followed by Vasco da Gama (1469–1524), the navigator and explorer that discovered the sea route from Europe to the East.
On the east side, from left to right we can see Marquis of Pombal (1699–1782), who was responsible for the development of the country and for the reconstruction of the capital. A figure that certainly wouldn’t have had a place here if the arch hadn’t been built so belatedly. Finally we see Constable Nuno Álvares Pereira (1360–1431), an equally important personality of the History of Portugal and Lisbon and founder of the Carmo Convent.
Four personalities from different times and of distinct qualities but all certainly related to the allegories on the top of the arch: Valour and Genius crowned by Glory.
This last stone sculpture set presents us three figures: the middle one is standing and represents Glory, who is holding two bronze bay crowns on top of the head of two seated figures next to her.
Below them we can see the inscription: “VIRTVTIBVS MAIORUM VT SIT OMNIBVS DOCMENTO. P.(ECVNIA) P.(VBLICA) D.(ATVM)”, which means: By virtue of the Greatest, so that it may serve everyone as a teaching. Dedicated to public expenditure. ”
On the west side we can see the female figure of the goddess Minerva wearing a plume helmet and holding a sword, with a lion resting by her side. On the two sides of the helmet are presented two small winged dragons, which remind us of the symbol of the House of Aviz.
The roman goddess Minerva, associated with the greek Athena, is the goddess of wisdom, strategic warfare and the sponsor of arts, hence being connected to Valour.
Genius is here represented on the east side by the god Apollo with books and a lyre. In this case the beardless young figure has wings, which connects it to the Christian figure of the Archangel Michael.
On top of one of its wings there’s a discreet small figure of a philosopher that we hypothetically associate to the roman writer of the 1st century BC Virgil.
The symbology of the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio, the Equestrian Statue of King José I, the Cais das Colunas and even the dimensions and proportion of the Square and of the buildings that constitute it, have been targets of interpretations that tend to emphasise its masonic and esoteric character. We leave these reflections to the specialists.
To finish off, we must suggest you visit the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio that has been open to the public since 2013. You can access it in Rua Augusta by going on an elevator and then going up a few stairs. You’ll have access to a terrace where you can admire the stunning view.

“Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life.” ― Fernando Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet
Lisbon, the city that illuminates history and culture, has been the soul city of some great writers. After years of traveling vicariously in and around Lisbon through José Saramago’s novels, I was finally there!
My first visual of Lisbon was through Saramago’s tour de force, ‘The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis’ —
“The sea ends, and the earth begins. It is raining over the colorless city. The waters of the river are polluted with mud, the riverbanks flooded. A dark vessel, the Highland Brigade, ascends the somber river and is about to anchor at the quay of Alcântara.”
The eponymous protagonist, Ricardo Reis, one of the many heteronyms of the modernist poet Fernando Pessoa, returns to Lisbon amidst political turmoil in 1935 after 16 years of exile in Brazil. Ricardo Reis strolls around Lisbon’s boulevards and narrow streets, observing the changes that…

You know what they say, right? It is very easy to come to Lisboa, but to leave this city is very hard. In the next few months, you will spend in this ‘ ‘, you will find out that this could not be more true. To get familiar with the place you can call home for your Erasmus semester, Cidade Linda here are some of the highlights you can — and should — not miss.
You probably noticed them in your new neighbourhood: These small restaurants or local cafés can be found throughout the city. Start your day by ordering a strong ‘ bica’ and a pastel de nata. You cannot leave Lisboa without trying this combination out and, chances are high it will even become your daily routine!
Besides supporting your local pastelaria, check out Manteigaria as well. There are two: one in Rua do Loreto and one in Lisboa’s Time Out Market. This food market is also great for getting a bite or a drink during the day or evening.
When you are done exploring the city and head out to Belém, the place not to miss for the best pastéis de Nata (this is plural of ‘ pastel de nata ‘ by the way, which is good to know in case you want to order more than one) is Pastéis de Belém. Easy to recognise because people line up in the street, but it’s worth the wait. Trust me!
On a Tuesday or Saturday, take a stroll through. Feira da Ladra is a secondhand market, up in the area between the Graça and Alfama neighbourhoods and is a must-see as well. It is a great place to go treasure hunting and find a truly special souvenir to bring home: uniquely illustrated postcards, plates with a 70’s design, but also vintage shoes or old leather bags. Enjoy a walk back to the city centre from here, and you will notice why they say Lisboa is built on seven hills right away.
One of the best places in town to get a drink with a view is Park Rooftop. When you haven’t been there before, it can seem a bit strange to enter a random parking garage for a drink. But, just take the elevator all the way up and you are at the rooftop bar. It can be hard to get a table but try going during the day and enjoy the view on the Ponte 25 de Abril. This place is also nicest views over the city must be highly recommended when the sun sets or for parties at night.
There is a lot to see and do in the city of course, but when the temperatures rise — and believe me, they will — check out the beaches nearby. Easy to reach by train are those of Carcavelos, Estoril and Cascais. Another great one is Costa da Caparica, on the other side of the Tejo river. Take the bus from Praça da Espanha and you can be in the ocean just forty minutes later. Perfect, right? And, since you are there, you might as well try a surf lesson.
A night out in Lisboa starts here. Meet your friends at the nearby Praça Luís de Camões and head into one of the small streets to buy a cheap drink at one of the bars. From here, you can easily walk down, towards the river, to the Cais do Sodré area later that night. Here, the bars and clubs can be found in Pink Street. Not the official name, but the asphalt is actually painted pink. Try some of the streets around it as well, just follow the crowd and enjoy your drink out on the streets!
Another thing not to miss is LxFactory. Try to go on a Saturday and have a look at the market at this former threads and fabrics factory, but any other day is nice as well to go here for a drink, lunch, brunch and do some shopping. Oh, and you should definitely check out Livraria Ler Devagar, an amazing there. Hundreds of books cover the walls — both, new and second-hand — which make space not only nice to see in real life but definitely Instagram-worthy as well.
Check out the concerts and other festivals that LX Factory organises, there’s always something going on. they organise at LX Factory too, there are some cool events going on.
Just follow these six tips, and you will slowly become more of a local in your new city. In the next few months, you will undoubtedly have tons of tips to add to the list and understand even more why you can never really leave Lisboa.
Truth is, moving to a new place shouldn’t be stressful. Book a new home online with Uniplaces.

I’ve learned that big cities are a hassle no matter where in the world you travel. If you have a rental car, driving in European urban centers is incredibly stressful. That’s why I chose to ride the bus into Lisbon and let someone else deal with traffic.
My base in Óbidos offered a simple solution. A comfortable bus picked me up less than a five minute walk from my Airbnb and dropped me off in Lisbon city center one hour later for $8. Best deal of the trip I’d say.
One of the first things you learn about Lisbon is that the city you see today is relatively new (by European standards). On November 1, 1755, a powerful earthquake leveled much of Portugal’s capital. An ensuing tsunami and fire increased the devastation. More than 35,000 people died. At the time, Lisbon was one of the largest cities in Europe.
Ruins of the Carmo Convent in central Lisbon were preserved as a memorial to the earthquake. Today the site appropriately serves as an archaeological museum. Stone arches inside rose to an open sky, providing silent testaments to the day Lisbon crumbled.
Legend has it that Lisbon, similar to Rome, was founded on seven hills. There were incredible views out over the city from the top of each hill but you had a workout hiking up and down each one.
I found that Lisbon was an interesting mix of modern and an almost whimsical past. Rickety trams clicked and clacked their way up the hills as electric cars whirred by.
It was a great city to just wander rather than trying to hit a list of major sights. You were bound to get lost anyway in the winding streets of the old town. Rare for Europe, the city’s commercial center actually had a grid-like street plan built after the earthquake.
I’d compare Lisbon to San Francisco in the States. Both cities are on the ocean, have hills and trams. Both suffered devastating earthquakes. Lisbon even had a suspension bridge spanning its bay that resembled the Golden Gate.
I peeked inside this store for Portugal’s national football (not soccer) team. Led by star Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal is still alive in the current World Cup. When the team is playing, life pretty much comes to a standstill here, with everyone gathering around their TVs. Portugal’s historical rivals include Brazil, Spain and France.
I jumped on a local train to go a few minutes down the coast for a visit to the Belém neighborhood in western Lisbon. A massive monument to Portuguese explorers was built there as a nod to its place as the point where ships departed Lisbon.
Belém also housed Jerónimos Monastery, erected in the early 1500s near the launch point of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama’s first journey. Da Gama became the first European to reach India by sea after he sailed around the south of Africa at the Cape of Good Hope. His remains were interred in a prominent carved tomb in the nave of the monastery’s church.
Da Gama’s discovery and the subsequent Portuguese armadas that sailed to India for spices helped build the small country into a serious world power in the 1500s.
So much of Portugal’s history and culture, its national identity really, stem from the Age of Discovery.

Long before cities like Paris, Munich, and London began to emerge, one Western European city stood above the rest. Known for its culture, elegance, and community, this city was developed on seven hills surrounding the beautiful blue-teal waters of its harbor and beyond. Known for Fado music, melancholic and soulful melodies through song illustrating histories of social marginality and transgression. And known for their Pastéis de Belém, delicious custard tarts in which the original recipe is still a mystery. Combining the benefits of sharing the same climate as San Diego while also remaining as low cost as Midwest America, this complicated, picturesque, and attitude-changing city of Lisbon, Portugal, exemplifies how geography shapes a society. Modern geologists and sociologists have fiery arguments on whether geology shapes society or whether the societies we create affect which type of geology we settle in. And while a combination of both seems to be the truth, Lisbon highlights how not only geography shapes a city but how geological events change the philosophy, community, and culture of a city and its surrounding society.

Curiosities:
Did you know that Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in Western Europe, predating other European capitals such as Paris and Rome? Its history dates back over 3,000 years, making it a living testament to the passage of time and the resilience of its people.
Climate and Best Time to Visit:
Lisbon enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and warm summers. The best time to visit is during the spring (April to June) and autumn (September to October) when the weather is pleasantly mild, and the city is adorned with blooming flowers and lush greenery.

Typical Phrases:
As you wander through the streets of Lisbon, you’ll often hear locals greeting each other with “Bom dia” (Good morning), “Boa tarde” (Good afternoon), or “Boa noite” (Good evening).

The last time I was in Europe was in 2019 when I went to Web Summit Lisbon: the world’s largest tech conference.
I have the chance to be back in Europe this summer, funnily enough, in Lisbon again.
Turns out I really like coming back to places. I’ve got to reflect on the (massive) personality changes I’ve had since 2019… as well as the things that really haven’t changed (spoiler: I still get really loud when I am enthusiastic. And I have a very low bar for things that make me enthusiastic… things within life are just SO worth raving about).
My recollection of Lisbon in 2019 was entirely fantastical. I didn’t have one bad thing in my memory… I even forgot about all those stairs. Youthful bliss.
Adulthood comes with new features: some are good (wine at lunch) and some are not so good (an adult culture of complaining). This second time in Lisbon has me reflecting on my sense of adventure and open-mindedness from before. While places do have their downsides, overall, I think the big picture of life is generally quite positive; it’s something that adults lose track of among the millions of opportunities to be negative.
For example, Lisbon has many (many!) stairs/hills, but it’s also filled with stunning view points. I could complain about the stairs or I could appreciate the sheer fact that you can see the ocean, castles and millions of portuguese roofs from the centre of Lisbon.
Anyway, this is the start to yet another ramble about how great it is to be an optimist: to see the world for all its amazingness. While this is not a complex sentiment, it can be overruled with our primitive software (i.e., our brains looking out for danger) or the primitive software of other adults looking out for danger.
Let’s remember that the commodities of the 21st century are things the wealthiest of the 19th century couldn’t even dream of buying.
I’ve used the phrase zest for life over the last few years to ground my optimism for the world. I’ll attempt to inject this zest within the 5 lessons I learned (or re-learned) after my recent last 9 days in Lisbon.
While I was walking up a huge hill towards Jardim do Torel I noticed a very peaceful grandma sitting on a bench with her feet dangling and her hands doodling. The skies were perfectly blue and she was all cozy on the cobblestone road tilted 45 degrees.
There’s something so pleasurable about watching someone pursue their life for themselves, despite other expectations or limitations from terrain.
Similarly, my friend Jake writes a great and intense newsletter about golf, and while I am the furthest thing from a golf fanatic, I love reading his newsletter. He is so passionate and unapologetically a golf nerd that it’s just refreshing. It’s cementing to see someone else pursue their interests so boldly.
I like spotting the bullet-journaling grandmas and Jakes in the world.
It’s an art to pay attention and find these gems. But, if you look close enough, you’ll see many happy people and their passions flowing through their veins.
Our brains get easily flagged down by negative, ugly or scary things. I think the world is more kind than it is mean (re: Factfulness) but our minds have a huge distortion to notice the few mean things rather than the many kind ones. But with the art of attention, you can see beyond this distortion.
I’m a big fan of spotting cute things. Cute puppies in strollers, cute families with grown children… all wearing matching bucket hats, cute cartoons on fancy menus, cute babies with fat cheeks. It’s like a renewable resource of serotonin.
I even feel happy running around Lisbon in circles. Recognising spots from last time and places I’ve walked around a bunch this time.
Attentiveness allows me to log a street I’ve walked on such that when I walk on it again, it gives me a dose of familiarity: a very popular neutron-firing-pattern for the human brain.
I try to be attentive to all the Portuguese words, to recognise sounds and phrases, let them become familiar tunes instead of being drowned by the foreignness and communication barriers.
Essentially, there’s always a positive twist on my surroundings if I’m attentive enough. I derive a lot of happiness from hunting.
I’ve noticed a lot of people phrase their wishes in the past-tense:
These “wishes” are just regrets rebranded. I think the utility of regret is its ability to learn for or reframe the future. Why not reflect on regrets briefly, and then make wishes for the future?
Have wishes that aren’t regrets but plausible ideas:
Better yet, make these wishes more specific so that they’re not just theoretical.
Other than reflection, I see no reason to wish from the past. I see no reason to hold grudges. I’d like to learn from the past & pay it forward without dwelling.
One of my lowest points during this trip was when I was really tired and made a snap judgement about someone else. It’s inexcusable and not something I do often (thankfully), but also not something I’m immune to. It was a low point because I was really disappointed in myself.
I reflected and realised that I have my snap judgments in moments of desperation or insecurity. It’s not a them problem, it’s a me problem.
eople live lives with different compasses. They might achieve things in their lives I wish I could emulate or have, but instead of looking within myself for why I don’t achieve those things, I judge them to compensate for their gains with a loss. Basically, I will lower one element of themselves to feel less jealous.
I think this is a really rotten mentality. Lessening someone else to feel more secure yourself.
I believe I should appreciate subjectivity, i.e., respecting other people’s lives to co-exist with mine. Realising my beliefs are not objective and binarily correct, enjoying my life but not at the expense of how others want to live theirs and supporting other humans without being too pushy on my agenda.
Part of this journey has been internalizing that every human has something I can learn from. Everyone. They may lead vastly different lives than me but surely I do not have it all figured out.
Philosophically, my higher mind agrees with the notion of subjectivity and respect. But my monkey-mind can uncontrollably judge when it feels in danger.
I’ve been reading Tim Urban’s book “What’s our problem” and it’s undoubtedly inspiring these reflections of higher and primitive minds. The architecture of our brain is soooo ancient while the world is sooooo new; having a deep understanding of both is vital to co-existing in them sustainably.
Ancient = hunter-gatherers running from lions. New = can use a device built in 40+ countries to connect to the world wide web to click a button to borrow a bike for 10 minutes. These are very different scenarios!
The monkey inside my brain can mistake good, kind, different people with a lion trying to eat me. It will panic, judge, run, scream and desire a banana for extra running energy. And when it turns out that the person is in fact uninterested in having me for lunch, the monkey will be embarrassed it was wrong so it will use cognitive dissonance to rationalise how the perfectly fine human was actually a lion 10 seconds ago through the magic of animal-morphing technology that obviously the monkey catalyzed to relieve the threat.
I hope that’s enough of a vivid scenario to illustrate how silly our minds can be. Hence, I am working on a three-pronged approach to combat monkey-mind judgement:
During a conversation at Bahr Bairro Alto with Ula and João, we chatted about a random person pursuing a wealthy life in the more ‘traditional’ route. We’re a group of people who thrive on the unconventional route, so it was interesting to discuss someone with similar ambition but a different approach.
I just assumed this person was pursuing wall-street… because that’s what most people I know who want to make a lot of money do. But then they were both like no: think bigger.
I didn’t know there was something bigger than wall street? Turns out there’s a category well beyond wall-street that takes more insider information. Wall Street just has a good brand. Like Gucci (known luxury) vs Zegna (less known, but more luxury) or Rolex (known luxury) vs Patek Philip (less known, but more luxury)…. It’s a luxury so luxury that it’s off the market.
I liked learning this a lot since I get such a high off of learning about less-mainstream paths and more rare experiences.
This concept of thinking beyond the ceiling is so appealing. Our conversation added a new anchor within my pursuit for an interesting and status-quo-challenging life.
I have a very Serbian dad which means after his obedient medium-sized dog comes his stick-shift 2010 car with nearly 300,000 km logged. He taught me how to drive a manual car.
However, it turns out that driving on flatland & wide Canadian roads is VERY different from hilly, 1800s cobble-stone, windy, tiny Portuguese roads!
But you know… I did it and learned a lot.
There were many miracles along the way. Like how our Peugeot managed to go 120 km/h in 5th gear without falling apart, only getting a handful of honks and successfully avoiding all instances of parallel parking (big miracle, you have no idea).
We also had not 1, not 2, not 3 but 4 Portuguese people actively get in the car, demonstrate some of their manual car life lessons & help with hill-starts or parking. 3/4 were complete strangers who stopped everything to get in the driver seat, not kidnap us, and share their wisdom. Their helpfulness was such an asset and is one of the things I’ll really remember about this trip. It’s an energy I’d like to share more in life too.
Another thing I’ve noticed in Portugal that parallels my Serbian culture is how much people like to feed each other! Contrast to Asia, portions are VERY generous. It never feels like someone is optimising their margin. While this isn’t the most business-forward, life-wise, I really enjoy the vibes of the anti-stinginess. Essentially, I don’t want to make my wealth by selling the least amount of salmon for the highest possible price.
It’s been a really beautiful time… and in what feels like another full circle, I’m off to London, the place I was supposed to go in April 2020… :)
I’m grateful for the strings of the world and for your attention… now go enjoy something around you :)

PS. I have been watching some great optimistic takes on AI. I really liked this video and this one.

When Chris Pavone’s Two Nights in Lisbon was initially published in hardcover last May, there was a great deal of pre-release hype behind it. I got a print galley, a digital galley, and then a finished copy of the novel — which all came to me by the publisher without much prompting on my part if I’m recalling things correctly. Thus, it seemed like the publisher was particularly interested in promoting this one quite heavily from my perspective. But that’s not all. The book was generously blurbed, and quite gushingly, by several A-list American authors, including John Grisham, Stephen King, and Megan Abbott. Grisham and King, in particular, trumpeted the fact that this was a novel that you couldn’t put down. Indeed, this is a bit of a page-turner — if you don’t mind thinking about taking a nice hot shower as you read this. The thing with Two Nights in Lisbon is that it is more than just an effective thriller: it has something important to say and the ultimate subject matter of this novel is quite unsavory as it might be topical. I don’t want to reveal too much for those who have yet to wade into this book, but, suffice to say, I found myself putting it aside at certain moments because the real crime presented within it is so repellant and distasteful, if not violent, that I needed to take a break from the mechanization of this tome’s harrowing plot.
The novel is about a newlywed couple who are vacationing, sort of, in Lisbon, Portugal. I say sort of because it is also something of a business trip for the groom, John. However, he goes missing one morning and his wife Ariel immediately goes to both the police and the American embassy to get them on the case. Neither, of course, is of very much help to her. Then, she receives a phone call: it turns out that John has been kidnapped and Ariel has 48 hours to pull together three million euros in ransom to have him returned to her alive. Ariel, of course, doesn’t have that kind of money, but she happens to know people in her social circles who might. That is, of course, if they want to help her out — and they might have their reasons for not wanting to. And thus begins a bit of a cat-and-mouse game of double-crosses and requisite plot twists, and, naturally, the CIA winds up getting involved — which shouldn’t be saying too much as this is something mentioned near the beginning of this book.
Does that sound like a good premise for a thriller? It does to me, too. However, Two Nights in Lisbon veers off into unpredictable territory even though you can kind of figure out what’s likely to happen before it happens. This doesn’t make the book a less-than-stellar read; quite the contrary. This is a well-done slow burn, and the novel does go into important territory that has been covered by many thrillers being released these days: those that detail violence that is implicit against women. To that end, Pavone does a masterful job of creating a believable female protagonist who is quite vulnerable, but who does her fair share of fighting back against all sorts of injustices that are done to her. That’s probably the big selling point of this novel and what makes it so immensely readable. Having said that, though, this is also a challenging read because the book’s subject matter is bound to make readers quite uncomfortable. Thus, Two Nights in Lisbon is not an easy book to take. While it is a relatively quick to flip through even at being more than 400 pages in length (and it is a quick read because of its semi-predictability, which is a pleasure of its own and keeps the narrative moving), it could have been trimmed just a little bit. It feels a little overlong, with an epilogue that feels a bit tacked on to give this book a mercifully happy ending. (Or as happy of an ending as you could expect from a book such as this. This is not to say that I’m not happy it ends the way it does, but these characters really go through the wringer and there could have been, perhaps, a little less of that in the lead-up to the end.)
In the end, I’m not sure how far I would go in recommending Two Nights in Lisbon as a must-read novel. It is very well done, but it made me squirm. The writing is top drawer for being genre fiction— flaws are damned. And the book does have them: you can’t think of the twists and turns too hard, or the plot kind of comes undone. Without meaning to spoil anything, it turns out that the kidnappers go to an awful lot of trouble just to achieve their ends — though, at the same time, they must go to the lengths they go to. (For this reason, I guess I’m of two minds about this book.) In any event, perfection is always hard to come by, so we should be very satisfied with the care and craft that Pavone has put into this novel about the ugliness of American society and how women tend to get treated within it. Overall, Two Nights in Lisbon is going to appeal to readers who like their thrillers to thrill, but perhaps not too much. Me? I liked this, but didn’t love it — and the reason is that I now feel as though I have to have that hot shower to rinse away the griminess of the major crime that is ultimately revealed here. Two Nights in Lisbon is worth a look, but just be prepared to go against what those A-list writers were raving about. This is a novel you’ll want to put down now and then. You’ll need to just get through the repulsiveness of the female protagonist’s unfavorable experiences throughout this troubling yet searing work of genre fiction.
Chris Pavone’s Two Nights in Lisbon was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux / MCD on May 24, 2022.

A hidden gem in the western end of the European continent: This is Lisbon, a city full of beauty and poetry.
Located over seven hills alongside the Tejo river, Lisbon is attracting tourists, college students, and residents from all places.
The city is one of the oldest cities in the world and was first named Olissipo, founded by the Greek hero Ulysses after the Trojan War, according to an old legend. Lisbon’s streets of cobblestone, ancient ruins, and beautiful cathedrals transport the traveler through a thousand years of history, wars, and conquest.
Today Lisbon is flourishing with culture, music, restaurants, and concerts, mixed with nice weather and affordable prices. Visiting Lisbon, try their delicious fish and seafood cuisine. In June, sardines are grilled on barbecues on every street in celebration of the St. John’s bonfire festival.
Hop up for an adventure going to Belem Tower on a tram ride, and don’t forget to eat the delicious Belem Pastries. As the country’s capital, Lisbon holds worldwide cuisines reflecting its residents’ countries of origin. Great places to eat are the…

I was traveling in Lisbon. That day, I went to an old restaurant listed in the Lonely Planet guidebook. A guitarist was playing traditional Portuguese music. Tourists from all over the world were drinking wine and talking, their faces bright with laughter. I had a few glasses of wine.
I began to feel the buzz. I grew tired of the place and left.
I kept walking. Not along the routes tourists take, but deeper into the old city. There were no pretty buildings. The walls were faded, and the windows sat still in the dark. The road wasn’t smooth — just an uneven path of small stones and rough cobbles. Every step caught my toes. I kept losing balance.
As night deepened, dim streetlamps flickered on, one by one.
Women stood along the roadside.
Drunk, I approached them. I stopped in front of one captivating woman. I wanted to say something. She didn’t understand me — but she named a price in English. “Want to fuck,” she said. I couldn’t understand anything else she said.
I couldn’t afford the full price. I handed her a bit of money, then turned and walked away.
I approached another woman. Did the same — gave her money, then left. I just wanted to talk to someone.
I kept stumbling forward. The streetlamps swayed.
After midnight passed, fog began to settle.At first it hung loose, then thickened. It sank heavy into the pitch-black streets. Every shop was dark, shutters pulled tight. My sight blurred, then slowly vanished. I couldn’t tell street from wall. I walked with my eyes on the ground.
There was no one around. Once in a while, a car passed. Its headlights flared into the fog — then faded without a trace. The dampness clung to my skin. I kept walking, aimless. I didn’t want to stop.
Around dawn, the fog began to lift.A narrow alley appeared. Beer cans. Torn snack wrappers. Soggy paper cups. Traces of someone who had been there through the night. But no one remained. No women. No cars. No sound. No people — just what was left behind.
I was tired. I headed back to my room.
Morning was coming. The street had changed. Taxis and buses passed in steady rhythm. The green leaves of roadside trees glimmered in the morning sun.
At an Indian restaurant, the shutter rolled up with a loud clatter. Workers carried boxes inside, turned on the lights, and scrubbed the floor. The scent of spices filled the air. Metal pots clanged, hoses sprayed water, voices echoed. Everything was waking up again.
People walked. Shops opened. The day had begun.
And in the middle of it all, with sunken eyes from a night spent in the street, I quietly walked back to my room.

I’m going to go ahead and assume that 2 Chainz was visiting Lisbon when he made that song. Ok…..maybe that’s a stretch, but seriously this city is literally vibrating with some of the best energy I’ve EVER been around. And I’m one of those hippy-dippy, “I need to feel the aura, the mojo, the vibe”… whatever you call it, to get a sense of whether I’ll like something. AND THIS PLACE GIVES ME ALLLL THE FEELS.
The best way for me to describe it is to actually borrow from my home office, Havas Chicago. We have 3 major tenants of what it means to be a Chi-town Havaser, they are: All In. Clever. Heart.
You can tell that every single person in the Lisbon Village is beaming with pride for their agency, clients and country. They proudly represent some of the biggest companies in Portugal.. a leading grocery store, a major bank and even the train system. I’m helping out on NOS, one of the leading telecom accounts in Portugal. About a year ago, NOS came to Havas and said they wanted to completely re-invent the brand. Havas answered in the most ALL IN way ever……creating Havas Different, a culturally relevant, hyper-village focused model designed to service NOS. The team re-invented the way they work, so that NOS and Havas can fulfill the collective vision and grow together. WOW!
As a strategist, I know that clever insights are both hard to come by, but also imperative to doing good work. My mentor, Joao (The Head of Strategy), and the other strategists in Lisbon have it down pat. The insights they bring to the table are simple, yet poignant and surprising, yet delivered in a way that makes you feel like you knew it all along. For example, when NOS tasked Havas to create a campaign for the Christmas season, the team came to the table with most clever insight around the most prominent fixture of the season, Santa. They asked themselves: if we live in 2018, where technology rules our lives….why are we still writing letters to Santa? So, they created a campaign all around the idea that Santa MUST have a phone number and NOS was going to bring it to you. Again, WOW! (smart insight jealousy rushes all over).
Upon arrival at the office, I was immediately greeted by Maria José (a beloved receptionist). She and the others taking a smoke break immediately flashed me smiles, grabbed me for a typical Portuguese double cheek kiss and proceeded to start teaching me Portuguese phrases I needed to know. After that, my mentor Joao took me around the office and introduced me to everyone….again👏🏽 every 👏🏽single 👏🏽person got up from their desks, gave me a double cheek kiss and was ready to teach me about their agency and culture. Before the day was up, I was invited to take a walk all around downtown, view the amazing sunset from the River and try a shot of Ginginha, a trademark drink in Portugal. They welcomed possibly the most stereotypical American, midwestern girl with open arms and big smiles. Again, WOW (tear of happiness streams down cheeks).
So, like I said, it’s truly a vibe here. It’s hard to put into words. I can’t even do it justice, but I’m OBSESSED and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.

It’s a question I’ve been asked countless times since moving to Lisbon from Lagos. Sometimes it’s asked with genuine curiosity. Other times, it feels more like a challenge — a polite way of saying, “You don’t look like you belong here.”
But the truth is, I’ve been asking myself the same thing, too.
When you leave home — really leave it — you don’t just pack a suitcase. You carry your culture, your accent, your rituals, and your invisible expectations. You try to wear them lightly, but they cling to you in moments you least expect, like when no one laughs at your jokes, or when your food smells “too much” in a shared kitchen.
What I didn’t expect was that losing my cultural footing in Portugal would help me discover who I am.
Growing up in Lagos, everything felt loud and alive. The streets were full of stories. There was always a neighbor knocking, a generator buzzing, a market woman shouting the price of tomatoes like it was breaking news.
I loved it. And I also wanted out.

Lisbon is a stunning city.
While it might be true that 1-day only is almost nothing for you to see the beauty of it, sometimes 1 day in Lisbon feels like a lifetime.
If You are planning a visit for the city, or even if you have no idea on what to expect.
I Got You!
Lisbon, the Portuguese Capital is a metropole, but when compared to other big cities, such as NY or London, it has a slow atmosphere. It feels like you’re in a fisherman’s village along the river.
Even in a slow way, it works as a big city, it’s a capital where You take 10 steps and listen 10 different languages.
People form all around comes to here, and you’ll probably never run out of things to do.
After all If we’re being honest here, the city is almost never “sleeping”.
Especially in the summer, when one part of city is going bed while the other is waking up.
Lisbon can be a lot even in just a few days.
Crazy as it sounds, as a Tourist Guide the thing I like to do the most in the city is…

I finally made it to Lisbon — bright tiled streets, salty breezes off the Tagus River, and the unmistakable smell of butter and sugar from the bakeries.
And there it was — pastéis de natas — the flaky, creamy, caramelized, and still warm pastry.
I had one on a street corner in Belém and thought to myself, ‘Yeah, this is one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. For those that may not know what it is — think about a croissant and creme brûlée mixture (it tastes like heaven!).
But somewhere between that first bite and the tourist-packed café I wandered into next, a strange feeling crept in. And it wasn’t for Portugal, but rather for Seabra’s.
If you know, you know: Seabra’s is a Portuguese supermarket in New Jersey. For me, there’s one just over the Goethals Bridge.
Seabra’s is loud, a little chaotic, and smells like chouriço and old linoleum.

As a product manager who has navigated through various roles and experiences, I know how important it is to connect with others in the same field. But what happens when there’s no ready-made community for product managers in your city? You build one.
That’s precisely what I did when I launched the Product Management Society in Lisbon. The goal was simple: create a space where product managers could share knowledge, network, and help each other grow. But the impact has been far more significant than I ever anticipated.
The Product Management Society began as a small meetup group. We gathered product managers to discuss challenges, solutions, and industry trends. What I didn’t expect was how quickly the community would grow. To date, we’ve hosted 50+ events and built a community of 1,100+ members from multiple countries, all passionate about product management.
Our community is more than just a group of people — it’s a vibrant network of professionals supporting each other’s career growth. We connect through our Slack group, where discussions around best practices, job opportunities, and product management challenges take place. We also have a WhatsApp group (invite-only), providing a more immediate and casual way for members to stay in touch, share opportunities, and engage in real-time conversations.
We host regular events on Meetup, from casual networking to in-depth workshops and talks by seasoned professionals.
At the heart of our society is the belief that product management is better when we learn together. From our events and workshops to our blog, we are committed to delivering valuable content and experiences for PMs at every stage of their careers.
Some of the highlights include:
We’re not just about talk — we’re about action. The Product Management Society has already made valuable connections with companies and other organizations. One of the major highlights was our hiring event with Altar.io, which allowed our members to connect directly with a top product-focused company and potentially land roles in their teams.
We’ve also collaborated with Productized for multiple events, including where our members had the chance to meet industry leaders, expand their networks, and gain insights into the latest product management trends. Additionally, we partnered with Product Weekend for another collaboration that helped our members further their careers and expand their skills.
Furthermore, we have an ongoing collaboration with Radhika Dutt, the author of Radically Rethinking OKRs, as she works on her new book. This collaboration brings exclusive insights into how product managers can rethink their approach to goal-setting and OKRs, providing even more value to our members.
These collaborations are a testament to the growing influence of our society and the opportunities we can provide for product managers looking to advance in their careers.
If you’re a product manager based in Lisbon — or anywhere else in the world — we invite you to join us. The Product Management Society isn’t just about attending events, it’s about building relationships and fostering a sense of community. By joining our Slack group, you can start contributing to discussions and sharing your experiences. You’ll also find job postings, helpful resources, and answers to your burning questions. Our WhatsApp group (invite-only) takes the conversation to the next level, offering a more immediate space for feedback and quick interactions with fellow PMs.
Our Meetup page is regularly updated with upcoming events, where you can sign up to attend. Whether you’re looking to connect with peers, gain new insights, or find your next opportunity, there’s something for everyone.
The Product Management Society also runs a blog where members share their thoughts on the latest trends, challenges, and innovations in the field. Whether you’re a senior PM or just starting out, you’ll find valuable insights that can help shape your career and approach to product management.

Lisbon is Portugal’s hilly, coastal capital city. It’s Europe’s westernmost city and the only one on the Atlantic coast. From imposing São Jorge Castle, the view encompasses the old city’s pastel-colored buildings, Tagus Estuary and Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge. Lisbon’s geography, weather, and history make it a great city for running. There’s a terrific 5-mile path along the Tagus (Tejo) River, going by important museums and landmarks. A lovely downtown (Baixa) run along Av. de Liberdade takes you by important squares and buildings, to Eduardo VII Park. For hills, run the narrow streets and lanes of the Bairro Alto or Alfama neighborhoods, up to the Castle or one of the Miradouros (view points). The largest park is Monsanto, which is now well connected to downtown via a recently completed ‘green corridor’– a path through a linear park. And if you like hill running, this is your city!
Our complete guide to running in Lisbon can be found on the Great Runs site.

MeetnGreetMe together with our amazing travel blogger would like to share memories and some tips with you in case you have been thinking about visiting Portugal for a long time, or just decided to go there an hour ago! Today we will explore the best of Lisbon, Porto and Sintra. Together with Anastasia.
“At the beginning I will give you some general information about Portugal. Portugal shares borders with Spain and it’s the most western country in Europe — sounds interesting, am I right? If you want to have a condensed view of European landscapes, culture and the way of life, Portugal might be one of the best options for you. I have been there twice and I am sure I will go there again. My both visits were in February (Yes, it sounds cold but believe me, even in February it’s +18 and sunny…and nothing can spoil your time there).
I have visited only Lisbon and Porto and some small villages nearby (for me it is better to visit fewer cities but to feel them, rather than explore the whole “Europe on two feet a day”. That is why today I will tell you about these 2 cities.
How to get there?
As it was a planned trip, I booked flight tickets in advance (Warsaw-Lisbon-Warsaw) and it was only 80 euros (which is very cheap I think). From Lisbon to Porto I travelled by bus — 4 hours and 20 euros- may be you will find a cheaper way to get there, but I didn’t have enough time for it and used a simple intercity bus.
Lisbon is the capital and the largest city of Portugal. Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world, and the oldest in Western Europe. There are a lot of tourists all year long and you have to be prepared for much attention (especially if you are a woman), tasty food, good wine and hospitality….let’s go!
I will tell you about places I have visited and advice YOU to visit!
Rossio Square (Pedro IV Square)
Lisbon’s most famous square. There’s no better place in Lisbon to soak up the local atmosphere than at Pedro IV Square. It has been the city’s main gathering place since the Middle Ages. Today, it’s the place where friends meet up and as a result it’s always crowded — you will not miss it.
Monument to the Discoveries
It is the mammoth white-stone Monument to the Discoveries. Do you all remember Vasco da Gama- the first European to reach India by sea….Yes-yes, he was from Portugal. Now you understand why they have this monument and so proud of it. You can ride an elevator to enjoy the view from the top of this Lisbon landmark.
Alfama
The oldest quarter in historic Lisbon, the Alfama district is dotted with architectural landmarks and it’s the charm of the neighborhood’s meandering streets, tasty food and wine, clubs with Fado (amazing music) that make the Alfama a can’t-miss destination.
And one more life-hack — Tram line #28
The historic “tram” takes you through the city’s oldest sectors past some of Lisbon’s most popular sights and attractions. You don’t have to pay extra money (the ticket costs like a normal one — 3 euro).
Belem Tower
Belem Tower, also known as the Tower of St. Vincent, this statue was designed to protect sailors on their voyages, faces the river and makes an incredible impression on you.

I fell in love with Lisbon probably on the day I was born, even though I never got it until I started to travel through the world.
When I started traveling, I began to look at my city with the eyes of a tourist, and that's the best way to find some hidden secrets or to look at places where you normally just pass through without even looking.
I’ll just share with you some 5 places not to miss in Lisbon and help you get as enamored with my city as I am.
Lisbon is such an old city that one of my favorite neighborhoods is older than Portugal, being over 100 years old.
It’s one of those more typical neighborhoods in Lisbon where you can Fado houses and still see a bit of an old times type of life, with a thigh community in the middle of a big city.
It had become a very touristy place in the last couple of years, but it’s still possible to get lost and find some old stores, where you can find fun trinkets.
Fado is part of the tradition not only in Lisbon but specifically in this neighborhood, where you can find a “Casa de Fado” almost in every corner.

This year I had the opportunity on both attending and speak at Droidcon Lisbon, in Portugal. It was an amazing first edition filled with amazing speakers and friends from throughout the country.
Recently I was searching for the slides of one of the talks and noticed that there was no global repository with them all, so well — now there is 🙌🙂.
If by any chance you’ve got slides that I ‘m missing — feel free to comment here or just ping me on twitter so I can add them 🙂.
None of this would be possible without the Droidcon team who organized the event, the speakers, sponsors, and of course all the attendees — thank you!
See you all next year 🚀

The final day on any trip is always a bit odd as there is a more clock watching brief to bear in mind as at some point there is that need to head off to the airport, you can’t just say sod it and get the next plane instead. And there is the packing, much of which on this trip meant refolding unused clothes we had brought. Mainly because there was the idea that we would come back in the evening, get changed, and then go out for food. Which didn’t happen at all, plus there was a bit of doubling up with hot and mild weather clothing. The unused side of the main case was a lot fuller than the dirty washing side.
Breakfast was the usual lunacy. We had been noticing little oddities, but I’ve rolled them all up into a leaving day edition. There has been a man in the hotel all week. Easily recognisable as he’s about 6’ 5”, bald and shiny at the front of his head, and then a foot long mullet down the back. He’s been getting a glass (for the fruit juice) and using it for coffee, pressing the americano button on one of the machines, and then whipping the glass out before the milk is poured (there is another machine which does just black coffee). He will then disappear, leaving the rest of the family in the restaurant, and then he would be back ten minutes later to do the same coffee routine all over again. It wasn’t until this morning that we saw where he was going. He went outside and sat in his car with the door open to drink his coffee, occasionally playing with the windscreen wipers (it wasn’t raining). I’m not who was happier with this arrangement, him, or his family.
Coffee in a fruit juice glass may sound weird, but there are always lunatics trying to go one better. In addition to mullet man, I have seen someone take a bowl (which is there for the cereals) and do their coffee into that. And conversely someone using a coffee cup to put their cereals in. Additionally, the breakfast room had a little Danone fridge in the corner, on investigation, it was full of Nestle yoghurts. I thought I wasn’t a morning person, but shit, I’m a fully functioning person compared to some of these.
Anyway, after the breakfast fun and games and packing, we checked out, left the cases, and went out for our last little wander of the trip. The fact we had dressed for going home and I had jeans and a jacket on meant it was bright sunshine and no rain.
We headed to the Edward VII park. It had been set out when most of the city was rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake, but they renamed it in honour of the visit of our king to the city in 1903. And for some reason they never renamed it back after he went home. Weirdos.
The park slopes gently uphill. Of course it does, this is Lisbon. You are going to be hard pushed to find anywhere flat to build a park.
About halfway up is the Pavilion Carlos Lopez which has some beautiful blue and white tiled scenes from history upon its walls.
In front of one a woman, and her photographer friend are set up. She has six juggling clubs with bright orange ends which she is juggling in front of the tiles while her friend takes phots from differing lengths away. When I say juggling, perhaps trying to juggle would be a more accurate description. When she drops most of the clubs, Helen and I say in unison, ‘sack the juggler.’
At the top of the park’s slope is a modern sculpture to the 1974 revolution.
And in front of it is the wonderful view down the hill, back over the laid out gardens, to the statue to the Marques de Pombal (who laid out the new city after the earthquake) in the middle of the double roundabout, along the main drag of the Avenue de Liberdade beyond and then there in the distance is the river.
Having come up one side of the park we go to amble down the other side and as we do we find ourselves outside the Lisbon Greenhouse.
It is a botanical garden, and we had seen the roof from above and the side and not twigged it was the greenhouse we had seen marked on the map. It is huge.
And full of greenery you may be surprised to know.
And flowers.
None of which I know the name of. Helen does, she knows most of them, and tells me what they are. Contrary to popular belief, I do listen when she tells me stuff, but where plant life is concerned, my mind does not want to keep that stuff. Which is a bit strange considering how much utter crap it is more than willing to keep.
I did retain the names of two, but only because I was been deliberately silly about them. Apparently, Nathan wants a cheese plant. Of which there were loads here, so many in fact it was more like a cheese forest, and I would certainly be happy if there was such a thing as a cheese forest and that cheese would grow on trees.
The other being a wisteria. And that’s only because I was saying I had heard people were going mad about this flower. ‘Really?’ came the puzzled response from Helen. ‘Yeah, it’s wisteria hysteria.’ I will point out I already had my coat and hat on at this point.
It was quite interesting, and I don’t mean in an air quotes fingers kind of way. Plus I was taking the opportunity to try and get some macro photography of the various flowers done.
I don’t know what these white ones are called, but trying to get near enough to them to do a macro shot was difficult as the juggler and her photographer mate had set up in front of them and now had another hanger on with them. In the previous half an hour or so since we’d last seen them hogging things worth taking pictures of, the juggling skills hadn’t improved.
We had heard the peacocks, but it wasn’t until we were outside again that we saw them. Just strutting around and not being tortured by moronic tourists into fanning out their feathers in distress.
There was time for a last café stop, a final cappuccino and pastel de nata in the park before it was time to head back to the hotel and pick up the cases ready for the journey to the airport.
Which didn’t take as long as the journey out seemed to.
I had the camera ready for some of the station art,
and got some blurred shots, some that missed altogether, some with window reflections,
and a feeling that somehow we’d missed a couple of stations as I was sure I’d seen some much more striking examples on the journey into the city.
The journey through the airport was smooth, bag drop was easy and for a change it was Helen getting the grilling about bag contents. Security was fine, there was a bit of duty-free shopping (not that there is duty on boxes of pastel de natas, just idiot tourist premium). I had been hoping to find a Forca Portugal store, but there wasn’t one. Having gotten Sporting Lisbon and Porto pens and magnets the previous day, I thought I would complete the big three, only for the Benfica official store not to have them, and the Football Gate store to have the Sporting and Porto stuff I’d got the day before, but to do no Benfica stuff because they had their own store.
Passport control was quick, and both coming out and going back the border police have been friendly and efficient. Something that perhaps the US ones could do with coming and getting some training on.
The queue at the gate was the usual bunfight / free for all. No sort of order in being called up, just get your elbows out and shuffle slowly forward in the queue. Or do what we did and sit there and wait for the back of the queue to come to us before joining it. And then find that on the plane there was no one else on our set of three seats, and the overhead lockers were empty. Bonus. Then it is roll to the runway and away we go.
Overall the trip was great.
Lisbon is a wonderful city. There is so much to see and do and four nights is nowhere near enough time to do anything more than scratch the surface. It is good exercise too, rest assured that if you walk for more than a couple of minutes in any direction there will be a hill to climb up or shuffle down.
The food has been wonderful, and it is cheap. Everything has been really tasty, and they certainly don’t scrimp on their portion sizes (they must know people need feeding up to be able to deal with walking up all those hills). And the people are so friendly.
The Azulejos are wonderful, and there are many splendid examples of art on the tiles. Although the occasional one did make us smile for the wrong reason. This one was designed to represent justice with the scales. But all I can see is saggy tits. Which again, says more about me than anybody else.
The only downsides have been the very showery weather, which no one can really do anything about, and which hasn’t dampened our spirits anywhere near the amount they have dampened out clothes. And the attempted pickpocket / bag theft thing.
But we would definitely recommend coming back with more time to get around more of the city and beyond (Sintra is only 45 minutes away).

I came to Lisbon for the vibe.
What I got was a full-body workout, a minor existential crisis, and two pairs of shoes that now live in the trash.
Let me be clear: Lisbon is stunning. Lisbon is magic. Lisbon is the seductive European city that will woo you with pastel buildings, flirt with you using tilework, and then betray you with an incline so steep your knees will write a resignation letter.
This is not a walkable city. This is a city designed by and for mountain goats.
You know when a city greets you gently? When it says, “Hey, take it easy. Ease into it. Grab a coffee. Sit by the river.”
Lisbon doesn’t do that.
Lisbon hands you a map, points vaguely uphill, and says, “Figure it out, loser.”
I arrived with optimism. I had good shoes. I had snacks. I had a plan.
Thirty minutes later, I was clinging to a stone wall, sweating through my t-shirt, trying to decide if I should keep walking or roll back down into the harbor and let the Atlantic take me.

March 17 has passed, and the EDP Lisbon Half Marathon 2024 is over. I can share my personal impressions about the race. There was a lot of fun, but also things the Lisbon folks should work on.
The race kit was okay, including a T-shirt, a bib, a cap (an excellent choice, as you’ll see why later), a magazine, some bags of tea, a cereal snack, an electrolyte pill, and a magazine. A very useful kit.
The quality of the T-shirt and the cap was very good.
My running buddy and I chose to stay in the downtown area, near the Marques De Pombal, at the Marques De Pombal Hotel, of course.
Access to the race is limited, and you can only get there by train. All participants must use the Fertagus train to reach the starting line at the Pragal station. To access the Fertagus train stations, athletes can use Lisbon’s public transportation system (subway, buses, and trains) for free by presenting their BIB. You have to take the metro and get off at the Jardim Zoológico station to get there. From there, you don’t have to go outside; just follow the train sign to reach the train station.
While on the train, I kept looking for the “25 April Bridge” to realize that we were on the bridge, just under the road where we were supposed to be running soon. The train trip was short, about 10–15 minutes.
We arrived at the last station at 8:55, and the race was supposed to start at 10:05. We thought we had plenty of time to get to our designated start wave. I was supposed to start from Box2, while my running buddy was supposed to start from Box3.
The first thing we noticed was that the only accessway was pretty packed with many people.
We did not panic and just followed the path until we got stuck in a sea of people. We were blocked in that spot for 30–40 minutes with little information about what was happening. There were no staff or organizing people around, just some policemen blocking the access.
We also thought we had time and space to warm up, but this was almost impossible with so many people trying to get into the designated starting box areas. This was my first half marathon where I did not do any warmup or stretching, nothing. It was impossible.
This was also the first half marathon where I had to stay in line and wait for tens of minutes with little information about what was going on. It was clear we were very far from the starting area.
At some point, the crowd started to move gradually, and we managed to pass the first checkpoint. We reached a zone where someone was yelling instructions about which way you should take to get to your designated starting area. There were no signs whatsoever, just a single volunteer yelling and trying his best.
For me, this was terrible organizing. Although I was at the race one hour and five minutes before the start, I didn’t manage to get to my box in time, and I had no place to warm up!
By the time I got to the starting areas, the lucky ones had already been in the race for 6 minutes.
I started at last! But it was so crowded on the bridge that I was forced to run on a metal grill next to the asphalt car lane. You could see the water down below, and the running feeling was odd. Most runners avoided the grill, but it was the only option to get in front of other runners. And I kept running on that uncomfortable grill for almost 1-2 km, I believe.
I overcame thousands of runners since I started from the back of the herd, and two days after the race, I am still paying for that effort. Around km 8, getting in front of other runners became easy. Till then, you had to do a lot of maneuvering to get in front.
I give a big F for the start experience.
The weather in Lisbon in March is unpredictable; while in the morning it is a bit cold, clouds cover the sun, but as soon as you pass 10:30, the sun comes out and starts to shine and burn.
My Garmin watch said that the average temperature was 28 degrees Celsius (82F) during the race, with a maximum of 33 degrees (91F). The weather prediction was 24C, measured in the shade, but starting with km 9, the entire race was under a nice shining sun.
Starting with km 18, I began to count the number of people who fainted on the side, and I think I counted 10–15 of them. Volunteers and medics were trying to relieve their pain, but seeing so many people dropping out of the race kind of made me more cautious.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed this race and loved my time spent in Lisbon. I recommend visiting this city because it is very nice, has good food, is relaxed, is clean, and has many things to do. It was my second time here, and I will come back the third, fourth, and fifth times whenever possible.
In my previous post, I wrote that my Garmin watch was predicting a finish of 1:46:54, and I thought that it was being conservative. I wanted to achieve more of a 1:44 finish time. It seems that Garmin wasn’t far off from my result. I finished in 1:46:46, which is eerily accurate!
I have mixed feelings about Garmin!
I’ve added some more pictures at the end and recommend doing the Lisbon Half Marathon. It is a race designed for a PB, and you can visit a great city.
The only tip I have is to get to the starting line two hours ahead, and I’m not kidding!

This was my fourth Web Summit, Europe’s if not the world’s biggest gathering of those plying the tech ecosystem. The conference has grown considerably since its humble beginnings in Dublin where its organizers remain domiciled. It’s not just the number of conference attendees, but its growing footprint in other regions that sets it apart from other confabs. Its portfolio currently includes Collision in Toronto, Web Summits in Lisbon, Rio and Qatar, and Rise in Hong Kong (2025).
Here are some data points from the just-concluded Lisbon event:
The record-breaking attendance happened despite the conference founder’s ill-conceived remarks on the Gaza conflict two weeks before Web Summit started. It sparked an exodus of big-named sponsors and speakers, as well as the resignation of the founder himself.
Very quickly, however, Web Summit secured a new CEO, Katherine Maher, the CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, who plugged the leaks and, within two weeks, righted the ship.
One afternoon back at the hotel, we shared an elevator with Katherine, where we had a chance to let her know how much we enjoyed her opening night presentation. She appreciated the feedback.
Since attending the final Dublin-based Web Summit in 2015, I’ve fallen into a regular cadence at subsequent events, including two on-stage moderation sessions, judging the start-up Pitch competition, participating in Mentor Hours, attending a couple of speaker dinners, and carving out time to listen to some of the more noteworthy speakers.
Two themes permeated this year’s conference: AI and climate, with the latter dominating many of the startups presenting.
On the AI front, I took the stage with Mikayel Vardanyan, co-founder of unicorn Picsart, the largest all-in-one creative platform of photo, video editing, and design tools — now fully immersed in Generative AI for creating images and video.
This is quite an impressive company with 1.5 billion downloads. Still, I had to bring up Gen AI bias after my query on the platform for a “successful business person” turned up four images — all of the same 40-year-old white man. I also worried aloud about the likelihood of bad actors using deep fakes to manipulate public opinion. Yes, that means you, Russia.
In my second on-stage session, I sat with some veteran marketing execs to discuss the changing role of the CMO. I reminisced about Y&R Inc’s “whole egg” approach wherein advertising, PR, and direct response comprised the three legs of the marketing stool. (Brand identity/design was siloed away back then.) I suggested that Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall, giving today’s marketers vastly more tools with which to work.
I suppose the greatest satisfaction for me was gleaned from connecting with founders about their early-stage companies’ plans to change the world for the better. This happened on the Pitch Stage where I judged a handful of companies whose solutions to small and big problems didn’t fail to impress. I also had a chance to mentor three young founders in the climate space: Guillaume Mandolini of EVAS, Dragan Gelevski of EarthCare.ai, and Diogo Costa of EcoCradle, who had these kinds words to share following our session:
There were other notable encounters, including over lunch when former Trump chief-of-staff Mick Mulvaney plopped down beside my wife and me. He, alongside esteemed journalist Michael Isikoff, suggested a political scenario in which both Trump and Biden drop out of the race. I wasn’t buying it.
You never know who you’ll run into at Web Summit, but everyone there had an affinity for technology and how it will continue to change our lives and livelihoods. Even Mick Mulvaney was there to speak about the tech regulatory environment.

Introduction:
In the heart of Lisbon, a city steeped in history and shrouded in mystery, magic pulses truly under the cobblestone streets. *Whispers of Lisbon* tells the story of Amara, a young historian with a gift for paying attention to the voices of the past, and Rafael, an enigmatic mother or father with ties to a historical magical order.
When their fates collide, they must navigate the secrets and techniques hidden within the metropolis’s winding alleys and get to the bottom of a centuries-old curse that threatens to consume them each.
As love blossoms amid the shadows, they discover that their destinies are more entwined than they may have ever imagined.
Chapter 1: Echoes inside the Alfama
Amara Mendes wandered via the slim, winding streets of the Alfama district, the oldest neighborhood in Lisbon.
The scent of grilled sardines and freshly baked pastéis de nata lingered in the air, blending with the faint notes of Fado music drifting from a nearby tavern.
As she traced her fingers along the historic partitions, she felt it once more — a faint, ghostly whisper that simply she needed to hear.

I didn’t mean to get lost in Lisbon.
I had landed with a rough map scribbled on a napkin, a backpack full of enthusiasm, and absolutely no clue how confusing the city’s steep, winding streets could be. I’d seen pictures of the iconic yellow trams, the tiled facades, and the miradors overlooking terracotta rooftops. But none of those Instagram posts prepared me for what it actually felt like to be completely disoriented in a foreign city, hungry, sweaty, and mildly annoyed with Google Maps.
It started innocently enough: a walk through Alfama, the oldest district in Lisbon, with its maze-like alleys and whispers of Fado music echoing from open windows. I turned one wrong corner, then another, and before I knew it, I was somewhere between “definitely not where I should be” and “oh, this looks kind of magical.”
That’s the thing about Lisbon — it forgives your mistakes by rewarding you with charm. One detour led me to a tiny café run by an old couple who didn’t speak English but insisted I try their homemade bacalhau. Another wrong turn led to a bookstore with poetry written on the walls and a cat sleeping on a pile of Portuguese novels.
By the time I figured out where I was (eventually — thank you, tram 28), I had stopped caring about the original destination. Somewhere between losing the route and finding a rhythm, I realized that this…

To avoid the worst of the carnage at breakfast it was breakfast first then get ready to head out this morning to get more touring done. It had been raining when we got up but was bright sunshine by the time we were leaving the hotel, only for the moment we sat on the tour minibus it to want to start to rain. And we were on a minibus whose roof was broken and stuck in the open position. But we stayed in our seats and toughed it out as it went from rain to bright sunshine, back to rain and back to sun again as we went round.
We were on the green route and done the stretch from Liberatores to the Castle the previous afternoon, but this time we did almost the full route, only getting off when we got back to the second Liberatores stop and hour and a half after the first one.
And I don’t give a shit if I am repeating myself, I would not want to be driving on most of the roads the minibus travelled on. In fact I would go so far as to say that driving in Lisbon is not for me full stop, but it does lend some insight to the story of the Portuguese taxi driver we had in Leicester back in the late eighties.
There is plenty to see on the way around and it is a struggle to get anything remotely related to good photos. Between dodging raindrops, the vibrations of the cobbled streets, there are angles to consider, bus frame to avoid, and when you think you’ve got it all lined up ready to go the lights change to green or traffic clears and the bus lurches forward with some sudden acceleration.
What the results look like will be interesting viewing once back home and they have all been loaded onto the laptop.
When we got off the bus, we chose a different road to wander down to get to the river, picking one which isn’t festooned with cafes and restaurants and full of desperate men trying to strong arm you into eating at their particular offering. The number of times you can run that gauntlet without just wanting to scream at them to fuck off is limited. The one we pick has a gentle incline to it, which is somewhat of a concern seeing as we are supposed to be heading down to the river. We reach the crest of the road and find it must have been more than a gentle climb. Either that or we are getting used to the hilly nature of the city, as the road down the other side is seriously steep, and we really didn’t think we’d come up so high.
At the top there was a mall, which we took advantage of to use the facilities (that is one thing about Lisbon which isn’t great, there aren’t very many public toilets at all, and so when there are, there are always queues). I’m queuing for a cubicle only for a little brat to queue jump and run in when the old man in there leaves. I take the next available one, and whilst in there I can hear the impatient brat shout to his dad, ‘I’m finished.’ His dad tells him to wait while he himself finishes. Only for the kid to yell ‘for fucks sake, hurry up, the Lego shop is closing.’ (It wasn’t it was half twelve and they don’t shut for lunch.) Hopefully, the Lego shop became the Lego-without shop for the little shit.
The road down takes us back to the Commerce Square and across to the river. It’s time for the next tour, only this time there is no bus, it is on the river. There’s a big river and tours on the river, so of course we are there, we’re well-known suckers for a water level view of a city.
We get some refreshments, sort out the correct token for the tour (part of the HOHO ticket), and find the correct queue (not as easy as it sounds) and get on the little boat. And when I say little boat, I mean it. We had seen the larger boats for other tour companies on the river, but this is tiny, like a minibus compared to the double deckers the others are using. But even so it isn’t full.
Again the weather thinks it is funny. It was bright sunshine as we sit having a bit of lunch, the rain only appears when we set off on the boat. It does have most of its plastic splash protectors down which helps. But not with taking photos.
But the rain does fuck off to be replaced by the sun before too long.
The original route is for the little boat to go down the south side of the river on the westbound leg of the journey, but with the rain, and the threatening clouds, it stays to the north and concentrates on the Lisbon side of the river.
Being out in the vast expanse of the river gives you an unobstructed view of how the city rises away from the river and the layers of buildings of all types rising into the hills.
The cargo terminal is fascinating (to me anyway). Just how huge the container ships are, and how the containers slot together to stack up and stay in place like a giant Lego set. (perhaps drop some on this on that kid from earlier).
And there is the bridge. You can see it is large from a long way away. But the sheer scale really hits home when you are going under it.
It had looked as if our little tour boar was going to ram the yacht, but we only passed close by to it just as we were both going under the bridge, which made a decent photo.
By the time we had made our way past the MAAT buildings we had been on the day before, and out to Belem, the sun was shining.
And there were plenty of opportunities to take decent photographs of the Monument to the Discoveries.
The Belem Tower is a much better photograph from the water than from the top of the tour bus as attempted yesterday.
This is where we turn around to head back and there is a terminal for people to get on and off as even the boat tour is a HOHO. Every other passenger got off, and were replaced by a new set, and off we went back to central Lisbon.
We crossed over to the southside of the river to do so. And besides the obvious tourist photographs of the Christ the King statue, there was much that interested me.
A bit further out to the west from Belem was this, which I am assuming is some kind of refinery type building.
Just before the suspension bridge is another very colourful refinery building.
There are egg shaped structures set into the slopes of the south bank.
And once past the bridge and all the way along the bank until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
We swing back over to the north side of the river and with the sun shining on the city along the stretch of government / municipal eighteenth century buildings painted in assorted colours, and the domes and spires of churches behind them, it has a very Venice-esque look to it.
When the little boat docks at the third of its little stops we get off. The wind whilst on the water has been bitter and we have walked the short stretch back to where the loop would be complete before, so we head off to look for food and to warm up.
The pier is close to where we ate on the first night we were here, and therefore we know that the Time Out Market is only just behind the buildings we can see.
But it is chaotic in there and we want to be able to just sit and relax, order something from a menu and have it delivered to a table, not try and work out which of the forty odd options to order from and then fight to try and find two seats together somewhere in the heaving mass of humanity in the middle of the hall.
We do take the opportunity to use the facilities though. Whilst I am waiting for Helen (the queue for the ladies is unsurprisingly longer and slower moving), I see a bloke go and drag his (I assume) other half out of the queue and shove her into the unused baby change facilities toilet. Once she is in there he is pacing furiously back and forth but gradually further away, and then outside. People who actually have babies to change are now queuing to use it. I get the feeling she’s had more than enough of his shit and is deliberately taking as long as possible or just hiding. Helen comes back before she reappears, but he’s not in sight, and we go the other way. Hopefully, there was a backway out and he’s still pacing there now. Alone.
We use the guidebook to see if there are any recommended eateries near to where we are, and it does mention a place within a couple of minutes’ walk the Rio Grande. A lovely old traditional restaurant with decorative tiles on the walls and old wooden beams.
What we didn’t realise when we went in from the front door was that the side window where we were seated overlooks Pink Street.
And outside our window as we eat there is a drag act in a skintight purple jumpsuit with a long blonde wig (which keeps trying to escape) on roller skates, and armed with a wheelie bin, who is entertaining / terrorising the passing tourists.
We had found Pink Street as we had wanted, but without even trying.
The food, as all food so far has been, was lush, and after getting past the drag act unmolested, we headed back up another different street towards the hotel. Where it was a case of have a bit of a rest and then change to layer up for yet another tour. This time the night bus tour. And not a single Harry Potter in sight.
Three of the others who had been on the previous evening’s walking tour were on this tour as well, making the fullest use of their tickets as well then. But on the whole, it was a sparsely populated bus when the tour set off. Which did mean it was good for me as I could move around a bit in the hope of trying to get some decent photographs.
It starts out fine as there is still reasonable light at 8pm.
But night is falling, and it is doing so quickly.
And whereas the camera can cope with any difficulties thrown at it in daylight, at night it struggles. (or to be more precise, I struggle to be able to set it up, so it doesn’t struggle as much.)
It can cope OK when it is dead still, but as the night tour doesn’t have and pick up points around it the only stops are at traffic lights, so there is a fair bit of motion to deal with.
And as light fades the camera tries to extend the shutter speed to let more light in, which when moving means blurring.
So there I am hoping for traffic lights to be red, or for magical traffic jams to appear.
To be fair I did get some reasonable shots whilst the bus was stationary.
But the one I wanted was when the route went over the bridge above Pink Street. I knew when it was coming, I had the lens at the right length of focus, I had the timing right, but the bus was moving too quickly as there was no traffic and no traffic lights and so it ended up a bit blurry.
It is dark by the time the hour-long tour is up, and we head back to the hotel. We had seen the café on the roundabout was open as the bus came past. Two minutes later as we pass it walking back it is closed and in darkness, so it is back to the room and chill.
There are no planned tours tomorrow, just us mooching on our last full day.

If there is one thing we understand, it’s the importance of your student accommodation towards your general student experience. What’s more, we know a huge factor is your student home’s location. You want to live in one of the best neighborhoods, one that’s just as perfect for you as your residence. If this is you, let us guide you through Lisbon’s best neighborhoods for students!
Definitely one of the best neighborhoods for students, it’s very, very popular with international students. Marquês de Pombal is known among the locals as the central business district of the city and also as a major transportation hub. With two metro lines crossing here, and something like 20 different bus lines to catch, you’re always just a shot away from any place in the city. During the day, catch the sun up in the Eduardo VII gardens and after nightfall head down to the Kiosk-bars of Av. da Liberdade for drinks with your friends. There are many student residences nearby, including several that are Erasmus exclusive. Check out our student accommodation in Marquês de Pombal.
An Erasmus favorite! If you don’t want to have to go to parties, but prefer the parties to come to you, rent a room in the Bairro Alto. From Thursday to Saturday, the crowds fill up every one of the tiny bars here and spill out onto the streets. Thankfully, it’s quiet enough during the day, so you can party as much as you want throughout the night and then spend your mornings taking it easy inside. Friendly warning, you guys: Bairro is for party-animals only. Check out our student apartments and studios in Bairro Alto.
The large avenue (Alameda d. Afonso Henriques) that gives this area its name has a very wide garden with plenty of places for taking in Lisbon’s great weather and a kiosk-bar where you can have one of the coldest — and cheapest — glasses of beer to cool off. The streets to the sides of Alameda have plenty of student flat shares that are popular with Portuguese students, especially students of Instituto Superior Técnico (- called IST, or Técnico, for short). Click the link if you want to check out some student shared apartments in Alameda.
The neighbourhoods of São Sebatião and Saldanha are between three of the main universities of Lisbon: Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Nova), Universidade Católica de Portugal (Católica) and Técnico. It is not surprising, then, that you will find a student in nearly every building of the area. Some places like Bairro Azul are almost entirely occupied by students. It has great transportation options, the Gulbenkian Foundation with its museum, library and gardens (useful whether you feel like art, a stroll or some study time) and El Corte Inglés, the huge department store that also has over 12 cinema rooms. Click the links if you want to browse for student apartments in Saldanha or to rent student accommodation in São Sebastião.
Alfama is not only the historical quarters of Lisbon, it’s the city’s heart and soul. This is a personal favourite of mine — the neighbourhood where I have always lived. You’ll find there is nothing more charming than Alfama’s crazy, maze-like streets, and there is no better way of taking in the city’s culture than getting lost here. At night, you can hear Lisbon’s traditional music, Fado, being sung from a hundred little restaurants. Houses and apartments are traditionally rather small and hundreds of years old, but some studios and apartments have been recently refurbished and make the perfect student homes to live in. Interested? Click the link to see student accommodation in Alfama.
Thanks for reading this post! We hope to see you soon, coming back for more.
Did you enjoy our article? Just drop us a line in the comment section below to let us know you did. And remember! If you need to find accommodation in Portugal, you’ll find the perfect place to call home on Uniplaces.

The History of the Siege of Lisbon by Jose Saramago (reviewed by Richard Seltzer),https://medium.com/@seltzer_57387/the-history-of-the-siege-of-lisbon-by-jose-saramago-reviewed-by-richard-seltz45-3a4214aed473,"Sign up

This is an excerpt from my book One Family, which is available from Amazon.
At the start of the Second Crusade, troops sailing to the Holy Land, stopped, by chance, at Lisbon and helped defeat the Moors, resulting in Portugal becoming a country and Afonso Henriques (our ancestor) its first king.
Jose Saramago (Nobel winner) wrote a novel with the title The History of the Siege of Lisbon, which questions historical truth in a paradoxical, philosophical, and comical style that resembles that of Borges and Lem. At the same time he tells the love story of two employees at a publishing house in modern-day Lisbon, a proof-reader and his boss.
The proof-reader, succumbing to an inexplicable urge, changes one word in a history book about the 1147 siege of Lisbon. The Crusaders say “no,” instead of “yes.” They sail on rather than stopping to help fight the Moors.
A woman hired to supervise proof-readers and prevent another such egregious error is intrigued by the implications of the mistake and by the proof-reader himself. She surreptitiously suggests that he write a novel that explores the possible consequences if that “no” had been historically true.
The narrative switches back and forth between present-day Lisbon and an alternative medieval past written by the proof-reader. His version of what happened is consistent with the fragmentary historical evidence, and is credibly told, with gritty texture and the addition of a love story that parallels his romance with his new boss. The Crusaders’ decision, rather than creating a tornado of consequences and changing all that came after, only leads to differences in how the battle is won and who deserves credit; the outcome is the same. The rip in time caused by the change from “yes” to “no” closes as if it had never happened. The fictitious version of events, created by the proof-reader, might be closer to what actually happened than the official version.
Saramago turns what might otherwise have become an academic discourse on history, fiction, and truth into an entertaining double love story that plays out in the same city, but separated by 850 years. In this book, facts aren’t as important as they’re usually represented to be. There are a few well-known fixed points on a time line, and there are numerous possible story-paths from one point to another, all of which are equally valid, because they lead to the same conclusion. By looking at more than one possible path, you come to know the characters and their circumstances with the texture, ambiguity, and shading of reality, with its dynamic tensions and ever-changing possibilities, rather than with the static view of linear historical narrative. The author succeeds in showing the heroic and passionate potential of everyday people in everyday circumstances.
I wish I could achieve such a result.

At Christmas I got several photography books in the Abandoned / Oblivion series of books published by Jonglez; Abandoned Churches, Abandoned Spain, Abandoned France, Abandoned USSR, Oblivion, Forgotten Heritage, Forbidden Places. I’ve had a look at the other titles in the series (USA, Belgium, Australia, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Germany) but was surprised to find there isn’t one for Portugal.
Having spent four days wandering around Lisbon I am sure that an intrepid urban explorer and photographer could fill such a book with examples from Lisbon alone.
There are lots of properly abandoned buildings all over the place of all shapes and sizes.
Some on the main streets of the city, boarded or shuttered up.
Peeling paint or plaster disappearing from the surface of the buildings helped along by the constant weathering.
Nature is trying to reclaim some of these for itself. There is a lot going on.
Unlike a lot of examples included in the series of books I have seen and have mentioned above, these aren’t necessarily isolated buildings. They sit in and amongst fully functioning, well kept and maintained, houses, shops, restaurants, and other businesses.
It is oddities, it isn’t like they are whole blocks left to go to rack and ruin. I may have seen one side of a street where all the buildings looked to be abandoned and on their last legs, but that was the exception rather than the rule.
To the south of the city and all the way along the bank of the River Tagus opposite Lisbon, from the April 25th suspension bridge going to the east until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
They look as if they must have been industrial units, but the whole stretch is mainly roofless, and the graffiti artists have been out in force.
It did look as if there was one little bar in amongst it all. But there was no obvious route down to get to the stretch of buildings. How would someone get there?
I am fascinated by this stretch of buildings, but as to how to get in there, I’m better off not knowing as I would just have spent a lost day wandering around the whole stretch clicking away and filling up my SD card.
And the spare one.
There are other buildings in disrepair, but they at least show signs of being worked on, metal and wooden fences surround them. There are piles of materials around, and there are cranes hovering above them.
I suppose if you went and looked hard enough in any town or city you would find examples of abandonment, but it feels different in Lisbon, I haven’t gone searching for examples, it is almost as if they have come to me. Though what I find strange now that I am home and I am searching through all the photographs I took, is ones I am sure I took of abandoned and crumbling buildings aren’t there, which makes me doubt my sanity. Most of the ones I have are of the riverside.
But I don’t speak the language and therefore don’t know what any notices on buildings may be saying. I don’t know what the law is about entering such buildings, and how the police would deal with such things. And most importantly I am on holiday with Helen, so I don’t go looking for that opening, for a chance to get inside one of these buildings and snap away.
Perhaps someone will, or there is someone already doing it, or even someone has already done it, and it is the next Jonglez abandoned series one to come out.

After two days of being toured out, it was time for a bit of freestyling. It did still start on a bus though. A regular Lisbon public transport one, taking us down to one of the main squares in the centre of the city. Whilst waiting for it to turn up I was admiring the doors and doorways as I usually do (yes, I know I’m strange), and I saw this one close to the bus stop.
Noting the number twenty-five above it, I spent the rest of the day looking out for any other doors or doorways with the number twenty-five above them. It was a surprise just how many streets there were where the numbers stopped at twenty-three, or upon which the number twenty-five was missing from above the doorway where number twenty-five should be. Still, I got plenty for the little side project that had popped up in my head.
We were on the bus to the end of the line at Rossio, and from there we started the long slow ascent up through winding narrow cobbled streets and steps up (and some back down again thirty yards further down the same road).
Some of the streets in this area have poignant pictures attached to the walls, some project which took photographs of those who live, or used to live in the houses there and they have been reproduced onto boards in an almost sepia colour, the history from inside the walls being displayed on the outside of them.
There were a couple of stops to do some shopping for tat. The usual, pens, postcards, fridge magnets. But we made it up to the castle entrance.
Which was a lunatic asylum. The queue was stupidly long, and there appeared to be three different sub queues and people changing between them because they didn’t know which one was the correct one to be standing in.
We weren’t desperate to go inside the castle and so we wandered the streets around the castle complex at the top of the hill. We saw (and heard) peacocks. Only for some dicks to come along and deliberately spook the peacock so it expanded its tail feathers as a defence mechanism. There really are some stupid humans around.
There are also Azulejos on walls everywhere in many different patterns and assorted colours (which triggered another thought for another little set of photographs for a project).
Before we stopped for a drink in a café called Tram 28. (Named for the tourist tram which rattles up the narrow streets to the castle and always looks like a sardine tin on rails.) The inside looks as if it has been built from two trams pushed together. A drink turned into lunch and a postcard writing session before we headed on.
And it isn’t everywhere where you are going to find a Tram Burger.
Across the little square was a church, we went in one side and out the other, and briefly thought about going up the tower, but a rude German family pushed in, and we saw the cost, and decided against it.
Instead we continued wandering around the narrow streets, gradually making our way down and out of the castle complex.
We then did a bit of retracing steps, following a bit of the route down from the castle to the cathedral which we had taken on the waking tour a couple of evenings before. I nipped into the cathedral to get a fridge magnet and a brief dodge of raindrops before heading on.
And out the other side we were then walking on street not previously travelled. More narrow streets, little alleys, steep staircases up, and down, between all sorts of buildings.
Unlike the planned grid of the centre of the city, this part of the city, Alfama, the oldest part, a lot of which survived the earthquake of 1755, wouldn’t know a grid if it hit it found the face with one of the cities beloved sardines. It is wonderfully winding, and you might spy where you want to be heading, only to find a couple of minutes later that it is in a totally different direction to the one you thought you were heading in. We pick up a couple of pastel de natas to help us along the way.
It is in this style we wander the streets before eventually finding our way up to the church of St Vincent. Which is absolutely huge. And wants to charge for you to go in.
But they, as the cathedral did, have some doors available for you to go in and sit in the back two rows of the nave of the church and get a long-distance view of the inside of the church (easily overcome with a zoom lens).
The intermittent showering has turned into constant drizzle, and the back two rows of the church were a brief interlude, we stop at a café to, if not dry off, then at least stop getting any damper. A drink and a pit stop later, and it is back out.
It is still raining. We make it down to the former church of Santa Engracia. This baroque church is no longer a place of worship. It now houses the Panteao Nacional (The National Pantheon).
This time we do pay to get in, a prolonged break from the rain will be good. The building houses the cenotaphs and tombs of famous and influential figures from Portuguese history.
It is a serious space, but I can’t help it if my head is the opposite of a serious space, and seeing this name on one of the cenotaphs, I can’t help but ask does it also contain a hot dog, and a jumping frog.
A lot of the tombs now housed here were originally entombed at the Jeronimos Monastery before they were moved here in the 1960s. Reading the biographies of the people here next to each of the monuments, you can’t help but notice just how many of them went to the University of Coimbra, which must be the Portuguese equivalent of going to Oxbridge.
We are able to go up to various levels, where there are displays of reliquaries, and collected artworks.
And then we are up at the dome level. There is an exit out onto the (nearly) flat roof.
On a clear dry day, the views out over the city and the river must be spectacular. But it is neither. The April 25th Bridge and Christ the King statues are barely visible through the low cloud / rainfall. But it does seem to be easing off.
Inside the dome there is a walkway all the way around the dome. It is a long way down. My knees were going (and not just because of all the steps climbed to get up here) and the head was a bit woozy.
By the time we had made it back to ground level and had a walk around the former church and chapels looking at all the luminaries in big marble boxes (including, in a surprise to me, the footballer Eusebio), and headed back outside, it had stopped raining.
And so the wandering around continued. There are museums everywhere it would seem. To everything. In fact I think all that is missing is a museum to museums.
We find ourselves back at the river, only to turn and head away from it again and head back towards where we had gotten off the bus this morning on the search for somewhere for us to have our traditional away on holiday curry. There was a detour to find a post office so we could send the postcards we had written earlier.
Still it is trying to rain intermittently. We had seen a potential place on giggle maps and head into an alley off a side street, go up some steps for a change and find the basic looking Nepalese / Indian restaurant.
It may look basic, but the food is amazing, and it is so cheap. Two meals and two drinks each only come to thirty-one Euros. I can see why it is a 4.9 on Trip Advisor. The place is called ODAAN, it is hidden away, but definitely well worth finding.
When we come out the rain has stopped, and the sun is out. There isn’t a cloud in the sky now. And so we head for the Santa Justa lift. As we pass through the square the queue for the 28 tram is as ridiculous as it has been every time we pass here. It may be the iconic symbol of Lisbon tourism, but seriously, who wants to be Lisbon’s favourite dish — sardines — on a tram, hardly able to see out of the windows on the trip up. You’d be far better off having a slow walk up following the tram tracks and being able to see it all.
Having mocked others queuing, there is a queue for the Santa Justa lift, built near the turn of the twentieth century by a disciple of Gustav Eiffel. Only one of the two lifts in its tower are working, but the queue moves quickly enough. It connects the centre of the city with the Bairro Alto high above it.
Once at the top of the lift, the little spiral staircases up to the upper level of the viewing platform are closed, but the views out from lift level are worth the cost of coming up in it.
With the clouds having finally buggered off for the day there are magnificent views out over the city, across to the castle, and down to the river.
And behind it over the Carmel monastery which the exit from the lift takes you past.
It was one of the main flashpoints of the 1974 revolution, and it is a ruin, with little of the roof left on it. Some is used to house a museum. Unusual for Lisbon, I know.
We have been through this area on the bus but find some streets we haven’t been along to walk down (or more accurately at this point up).
The buildings are being lit up, including this theatre bathed in pink light.
There is another viewing point over the city, it is by the top of the funicular we went down in on our first night here. The castle opposite is lit up in green light, but for some reason the camera doesn’t want to know that and will only take the photo with it in an orange glow.
Once you have got past the mass of self-obsessed, selfie taking Instagrammers which plague viewpoints the world over now. Saying that we did try to take a selfie, but the reason we don’t usually take selfies is because we’re both shit at it, and the more photos I seem to have taken of me recently, the more my eyes are changing into the bastard sons of Marty Feldman’s.
The Bairro area is lined with huts serving food and drink and we grab drinks to go and head up roads we’ve been on a tour bus going in the opposite direction to.
I’m still trying to take nighttime shots of interest as we pass.
Helen mentions it would be nice to get some cheese, but there is nowhere open that sells cheese. We see a pharmacy (always a plus), and joke that it should be possible to get cheese on prescription.
We end up on another very steep downhill path, so much so they have made half the footpath into steps. At the bottom it isn’t far to get to the hotel, and time to collapse and rest.
And to try not to think that we have to go home tomorrow.

It was supposed to be a chill walk.
I had Spotify in my ears.Google Maps in my hand.And absolutely no idea where I was going.
Welcome to day 2 of my solo trip.Sunburnt, sleep-deprived, and 100% lost in Lisbon.

I didn’t.
Instead, I kept walking.Up a street that was definitely a hill.Through a park that might’ve been private property.Past a guy yelling at pigeons.
Until I sat on the edge of a fountain, next to a trash can, and cried behind my sunglasses like a drama queen on a budget airline.
I was crying because I was tired of pretending I wasn’t.
Not just that day.In general.

We went to The Obsidian Room near the river to celebrate closing the Lisbon project.
No pricing anywhere. Dark wooden panels. Thick white tablecloths. Everything was heavy. Even the metal-sleeved menus.
Hugh was there with a few others from the team. My team. A couple of the finance lot joined. The rest were clients who’d flown over from the States.
There was champagne on arrival. Everyone was shaking hands, swapping cards, patting backs. All smiles now that it was over and I’d made them look good.
When we sat, one of the Americans started a speech in my honour. I bowed my head. Humble.
He raised his glass. “To Lisbon.”
Caught Hugh watching me, just for a second. I was on top. He knew it. Everyone knew it. He didn’t like it.
I stood, “They said it couldn’t be done. But I didn’t listen.”
A few cheers.
“You’ve still never beaten me on the courts, though!” Hugh was grinning over his glass.
A few polite chuckles. His way of getting one over me.
“No,” I grinned back, “but you’ve never beaten Lisbon.”
Raucous laughter. That shut him up.

The light lingered, warm against the cold marble arcs of the quiet convent, as I walked in. As my eyes wandered along the neat rows of sun chairs, my nose travelled to the long summer evenings of my childhood, that smelled of sweet popcorn and cotton candy.
I had never been to an outdoor cinema before, so when my friend suggested we go, I jumped at the opportunity. Now, standing here, I was glad I did.
The re-run was the 1999 teen comedy, “10 Things I Hate About You”. A classic “chick-flick” which I have admittedly watched several times before. It’s a light-hearted love story that ends well, and gives you the right amount of 90’s nostalgia.
Before you go off questioning my taste in movies, I didn’t decide to spend 10 euros on this particular occasion for the sake of the film in question. I spent the 10 euros for the experience.
And an experience it was.
From the moment we stepped into the soft afternoon glow of Graça, I was already in my own outdoor movie. Like a dream within a dream.

Discussing Azure, blockchains and… machine learning rap
This past week was quite eventful for me. I attended the school-symposium DATA Science 2018 — in (Astro)Particle Physics and the Bridge to Industry (about which which I’ll have a post soon) during the whole week, but on Wednesday I went to Microsoft’s headquarters in Lisbon for the 5th PyData Lisbon Meetup | Special Edition.
It’s impressive that the PyData Lisbon community has already more than 500 members as there had only been four events beforehand (the first one in last September). The fifth meetup had 200 participants (the maximum that the Microsoft’s auditorium would allow) and for a good reason: the YouTube phenomenon Siraj Raval was in the house!
But before we met Siraj Raval, there was the talk “We ran out of memory” by Silvio Rodrigues and Tim Kock, two of the founders of Jungle AI, a young startup specialized in predictive intelligence. It dealt with machine learning at scale, using the Azure cloud platform by Microsoft to solve problems which cannot be handled by a laptop.
As a beginner in these things, it was fascinating to me to see such large scale machine learning being used in real-world situations. Even though I wasn’t able to follow every single detail, the informality and joviality of Tim Kock kept me engaged in the presentation.
After a small break for some pizza and beer (thanks Microsoft!), it was time to listen to Siraj Raval, with his presentation “AI Networks”, which you can find in his GitHub. He mostly discussed the next phase of the Web, “Web 3.0”, focusing on blockchain technology and decentralized applications.
I’ve only come across Siraj’s YouTube channel a few months ago while I was searching for videos about machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I was very surprised by the enormous number of subscribers. Who knew so many people would watch videos discussing machine learning algorithms and frameworks?
And apparently some of his early videos had him rapping about these concepts! I hadn’t watched any of them, but Siraj was kind enough to showcase his abilities during the Q&A. I confess that that was not what I was expecting to see when I went to this meetup.
Overall, it was an entertaining evening . If you’d like to check, the event was live streamed on Facebook — and, yes, it includes the rap at the end.

In Lisbon, the soul of the city is written in azulejos. These hand-painted ceramic tiles cover the facades of its oldest buildings, shimmering in sunlight and rain alike, whispering the stories of the city’s past. But walk through Lisbon today, and you’ll notice gaps where tiles once clung — empty spaces on walls like missing teeth in a smile. Construction sites pile broken tiles alongside debris, while sleek new developments encroach on neighborhoods that once hummed with history. It’s here, amid the rubble of modernity, that Serra Behar steps in.
Serra, an artist and a neighbor, isn’t just creating art; she’s waging a quiet, poignant battle to preserve Lisbon’s identity. Her exhibition, Autoimmunity and Allergy, now showing at MAD Gallery, speaks to the fragility of the azulejo, but more importantly, to the fragility of the systems and memories they represent. Each azulejo Serra collects — chipped, cracked, or discarded — is a piece of Lisbon’s story that she refuses to let fade away.
The Artist as Caretaker
For Serra, saving azulejos is an act of care. “Each tile I pick up feels like rescuing a fragment of the city’s memory,” she tells me, her tone both determined and wistful. Her work begins on the streets, where she searches construction sites and demolition zones for tiles that have been cast aside. These aren’t perfect tiles — they’re worn, their colors dulled by time, their edges chipped. But that’s precisely why Serra finds them beautiful.
“They’ve lived,” she says simply. And now, they live again through her art.
At MAD Gallery, her rescued tiles are arranged in installations that feel both meticulous and tender. The rawness of the broken tiles contrasts with the clean gallery space, making the viewer hyperaware of their imperfections. “They’re not supposed to be perfect,” Serra explains. “They’re supposed to remind us of what’s been lost — and what’s worth saving.”
Saving Lisbon, One Tile at a Time
Lisbon, like many cities, is caught in a paradox. Its history is its greatest asset, but its future is being built at the expense of that history. Serra’s work grapples with this tension. Through her art, she shows how azulejos — these seemingly small, decorative objects — are, in fact, vital to the city’s identity.
The azulejo is more than an aesthetic flourish; it’s a language. Its patterns and colors speak of Portugal’s Moorish past, its maritime adventures, its religious traditions, and its modernist movements. But when these tiles are removed, the city loses a piece of its voice. The smooth, glassy surfaces of new construction might glimmer, but they are mute.
Serra’s mission is to give those missing tiles a voice again. By presenting them as art, she forces us to see them not as relics but as witnesses. Each crack and chip becomes a story: of the artisan who painted it, the wall it adorned, and the generations who passed by it on their way to somewhere else.
The Skin of the City
Serra’s exhibition title, Autoimmunity and Allergy, is not a metaphor she chose lightly. She compares the removal of azulejos to a skin condition, where the protective outer layer is damaged, leaving what lies beneath exposed and vulnerable. “Tiles are the skin of buildings,” she says. “They protect the structure, but they also define its character. When you strip them away, you expose scars — not just physical scars, but cultural ones.”
Her metaphor extends further. Just as the body can attack itself in autoimmune diseases, cities, too, can turn on themselves. In the rush to modernize, Lisbon has unwittingly destroyed parts of itself, sacrificing its unique character for the sake of progress. Serra’s work asks a pressing question: Can we find a way to modernize without erasing? Can Lisbon save itself from itself?
A Quiet Resistance
There is a quiet, almost subversive quality to Serra’s art. She isn’t staging protests or writing manifestos. Instead, she’s walking the streets of her city, rescuing one azulejo at a time. Each piece she collects is a small act of defiance, a refusal to let history be discarded like construction waste.
At MAD Gallery, this resistance is palpable. The tiles are displayed not as ornaments but as artifacts. Serra has stripped them of their original context, forcing the viewer to consider their fragility and their significance. Some are arranged to emphasize their broken edges, others are mounted to reveal the raw, unglazed sides that were never meant to be seen. It’s as if the tiles themselves are saying, “Look at me. Remember me.”
The Power of One
In a city as vast and complex as Lisbon, the idea of saving it one azulejo at a time might seem quixotic. But Serra believes in the power of small, deliberate acts. “You don’t save a city all at once,” she says. “You save it piece by piece, memory by memory, tile by tile.”
Her work resonates not because it offers grand solutions but because it reminds us of the importance of paying attention. It’s easy to overlook the cracks in a facade or the gap where a tile used to be. But Serra’s art asks us to slow down, to notice, and to care.
An Invitation to See
As I left MAD Gallery, I found myself looking at Lisbon differently. I noticed the patterns on the azulejos of buildings I’d passed a hundred times without a second thought. I noticed where tiles were missing and where new ones had been added in their place. I noticed, too, the scaffolding that seemed to creep further into the city with every passing month.
Serra’s work had done what all great art should: it had changed the way I saw the world. And it had given me a simple but profound reminder — that saving a city isn’t just the work of governments or preservation societies. It’s the work of individuals, of neighbors like Serra, who care enough to save a single azulejo from being forgotten.
For those who haven’t yet visited Autoimmunity and Allergy, I urge you to go. And when you do, take a moment to reflect on the azulejos you see — or don’t see — on your way there. Each one is a fragment of Lisbon’s story, waiting to be noticed, remembered, and, perhaps, saved.

Ah, November in Lisbon, Portugal — what an exciting time!
Now, I’m not just talking about those amazing sunsets, the delicious food, or the stunning buildings and hidden gems scattered around the city.
No, I’m here for something special: the Web Summit.
This massive tech conference is one of the biggest in the world.
It’s a place where you get to learn so much and meet all these amazing people from everywhere, all passionate about technology just like us.
While this year’s attendance wasn’t my first, it was, once again, an amazing experience.
When you attend a conference alongside 70,000+ people, your perspective changes.
Definitely, at one point I felt overwhelmed.
As I took in the surroundings, I considered the newcomers to this impressive conference and the questions likely swirling in their minds:
After pondering these questions, I decided to share a few words about my experience at the Web Summit in Lisbon and offer tips to help others feel more confident at similar events.
No one should leave such events with negative feelings about their participation or a sense of unproductivity. With some preparation, events like the Web Summit can unfold numerous opportunities.
I hope this article will guide you the next time you attend a large event, as it reflects what I wish I had known before going to my first major gathering.
Many Web Summit attendees are first-timers, and it’s crucial to acknowledge this. Beginners might feel overwhelmed in the fast-paced atmosphere and face common challenges of large events, making navigation seem daunting. With 70,000 participants, the event’s sheer size might lead some to dismiss it prematurely as not worthwhile.
However, I challenge that perspective. Events such as the Web Summit offer a phenomenal platform for learning and networking with influential folks from all over the world.
Still, first things first: your journey at Web Summits starts with your phone.
To maximize your benefit from the event, keep a few things in mind. First, make sure to download the event app, but be cautious about its potential drawbacks. While it provides maps, attendee lists, and other details, filtering people or presentations for specific niche topics of interest might be challenging.
Also, carefully consider how much you’ll rely on the app for networking because it is not primarily designed to facilitate engagement beyond the chat feature.
Consider in such an environment: how likely is it that those you message will respond?
Drawing from my personal experience: use the app for navigation, but avoid relying solely on it for engaging with people.
With numerous presentations occurring at the same time, it’s challenging to keep up with all of them. The venue is filled with ongoing presentations requiring constant movement.
In my view, the source matters more than the topic. A captivating title doesn’t guarantee the presenter’s relevance to the subject. I prefer finding relevant people and attending their presentations, regardless of the topic. Feel free to skip some sessions, as content is often repeated.
Consider your participation in the Web Summit as an investment. Approach it with curiosity and passion, asking questions and challenging ideas. Stay open to your peers’ ideas, as there are valuable learning opportunities. Strive to gain something from each presentation session, as this investment will yield dividends over time.
Friendly tip: Web Summit is packed with sessions, events, keynotes, and workshops. Prioritize the ones you can’t miss and plan your schedule accordingly.
And remember: no matter how hard you try, you’ll not be able to attend everything and be everywhere.
My next piece of advice is to schedule meetings in advance if possible.
This is the pre-event preparation phase I mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that first-time attendees may be eager to attend presentations and explore the venue, but meeting with the right people is crucial.
The people you meet at Web Summit could be your future partners, mentors, or investors.
You’ll only have one chance to make a fine first impression.
Friendly tip: At events like Web Summit, excellent opportunities often arise unexpectedly! Don’t hesitate to talk to unfamiliar faces and explore beyond your usual interests. You might uncover something surprising.
A key lesson from my experiences at Web Summit is the value of side events. They’re smaller, and more intimate, and people tend to prioritize building meaningful relationships. Also, make sure to have fun in the evenings. Many see Web Summit as a tech event that doubles as a big party, and there’s some truth to that.
The most valuable connections often happen when people are at ease.
Trust me on this one: feel free to miss a scheduled session for a lively discussion or a significant announcement happening elsewhere. Stay flexible, trust your instincts, and take advantage of chances to talk whenever they come up. Whether it’s a coffee break or waiting for a keynote speech, these unplanned interactions can lead to valuable new contacts.
Web Summit offers unique opportunities to network with individuals you might not have met elsewhere, such as an entrepreneur from Brazil, an investor from Costa Rica, or a remarkable founder from Japan.
Friendly tip: Don’t just focus on sales at Web Summit. Meet people, have engaging questions ready, and show genuine interest in their stories.
Remember Dale Carnegie’s advice: to be interesting, be interested.
If you have a goal for attending the Web Summit, make sure to plan accordingly.
For instance, if your goal is to generate leads or secure funding, take the time to prepare your pitch and craft effective conversation starters.
Also, decide where to focus your time to connect with the right people.
Your goal should determine your tactics.
Copying what everyone else is doing won’t lead to exceptional results.
Friendly tip: Bring plenty of business cards and prepare a concise elevator pitch about yourself and your business/interests. Nobody will dedicate an hour to intros, as time is a precious asset at the Web Summit — use it wisely.
My personal favorite spots:
Stepping into the vibrant world of events such as the Web Summit, it’s crucial to remember that balance is key. If you’ve reached this point, one thing is clear:
There is a lot to think about.
While the conference offers an ocean of opportunities, your success will rely on your ability to prepare and engage purposefully. Simultaneously, stay open to spontaneous connections and seize opportunities on the spot.
You know why you’re attending.
You’re there for a reason.
Keep an open mind and stay curious — a seasoned conference-goer knows it’s the unplanned conversations and unexpected learning opportunities that often create remarkable insights.
Most importantly, enjoy the process. Embrace the grandness of everything, the dynamics, as well as the rollercoaster of ideas and conversations.
After all, the true essence of large-scale events lies in the vast opportunities right in front of you.
Hope to see you next year in Lisbon!

Somewhere new for us to visit. I had been trying to find a location which would hopefully be warm in April and which neither of us had been to before, and being practical, somewhere which was a direct flight away from Gatwick. I was surprised by just how many places that ruled out. And how many places in Spain and Italy are code shared by BA ad require a change of plane along the way.
So I came up with Lisbon. Lots of variables around the dates, leave years, other events we were going to, and so on. So much so the fact that we were going during the week before Easter and all the kids would be off school passed me by completely.
It was a nice, civilised time for the easyJet flight from Gatwick to Lisbon, relatively painless apart from the ten-minute bus journey from the plane in the middle of a field somewhere to the terminal building. The Lisbon metro from the airport was straightforward. And the art in the stations was fascinating, if only I hadn’t got the camera buried away in my bag.
We popped out of the metro station, and it was two minutes to the hotel. For a change it isn’t an IHG one, as they were either in remote locations, or ridiculously expensive and had no points nights available for the four nights we were going to be here. So it is a random Booking.com hotel. Which looks decent enough in the lobby, but they are doing improvements on it. With it being a Booking.com choice we are in a before room. Which very much has an eighties Marbella vibe about it. But it is clean and has a comfy bed and its not like we’ll be spending much time outside of sleeping in it anyway. We’re going to be too busy being out exploring. Which after dumping the bags we were. It was a literal dump and run, no unpacking.
A bit of late lunch and we are off wandering down the city’s main boulevard heading towards the river. There is a market down one side of the boulevard, which we aren’t going to be distracted by, it isn’t a shopping trip. Besides aiming for the river there is no plan.
But as any regular reader will know we are easily distracted and tend to detour off at the slightest whim. There is no master plan for the trip as neither of us had looked at the guidebooks until we were on the plane. Though we have booked the standard hop on hop off bus tickets. As when don’t we?
The detouring didn’t take long to kick in as we saw a funicular off down a side street just a short walk from the main boulevard, and we headed over there for a ride up the side of the hill.
Lisbon is remarkably hilly, and most of them are steep. On the metro journey into the centre there were a couple of times where we popped out from being underground and suddenly found ourselves on a bridge over a valley before popping back into another tunnel.
Anyway, at the top of this funicular run is a short walk to gardens with views out over a lot of the city.
Next to the top of the funicular track is a building with an interesting tower and a spiral staircase up to the top. From which the views would be even better (even if it would be no good for my vertigo), but there is no public entrance to it. So we go back down and rejoin the main drag to get to the river.
A lot of the city was destroyed by a major earthquake in 1755, so most of the lower part of the city leading to the river was rebuilt in the late eighteenth century in a grid pattern, following what they had seen in Paris. They have managed to shoehorn some modern monstrosities in as they do everywhere, but there are some splendid examples of early twentieth century Art Deco buildings plugged into gaps as well.
They quite like a square here. There are some vast open paved spaces which we pass through on the way to the river.
And they certainly like a big old statue. A lot of the time it is a figure high up in the air at the top of a tall column, or as I got to be calling them as the trip went on, ‘another bloke on a stick.’
Anywhere they have a square, or a wide pavement, then they have cafes and restaurants spilling out into them. We are not going to struggle to find somewhere to eat on this trip.
Along one such alfresco dining mecca on a pedestrianised street we can see the grand archway becoming larger with each footstep.
Once through it, would you believe it, we are in another huge square. With a fountain in the middle (they do love a fountain, although not many of them have the water running), and on the other side of the square is the River.
It is the River Tagus (which I’m sure sees lots of people doing a tag us in post on social media), or as they call it in Lisbon the Tejo. At this point it is more like an inland bay. The channel which heads out west from here is wide enough, the massive suspension bridge shows that, but here it is more like being at the coast with it being the sea between you and another country. But it isn’t, that is still Portugal out over the other side of the expanse.
The sun is shining, it is a leisurely late Sunday afternoon and so we stroll along the banks of the river following the sun in going to the west, looking for somewhere to get refreshment. There are stalls along the front. The trend would very much appear to be to pina coladas served in hollowed out pineapples. A bar has a DJ playing next to the water, and in yet another square there is a live band playing traditional Portuguese music.
We find a café on the waterfront near the ferry port (for crossing the inland bay to the cities on the south of the river) in the sun and have drinks. The coffee looks amazing and tasted even better.
It is relaxing watching the people and the variety of boats going by.
We like it so much we stop there to have food. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a menu where one of the dishes have proclaimed themselves as being spiritual, but there on the menu is Spiritual Cod, which Helen ended up ordering.
It didn’t come with enlightenment or a prayer book, just in a dish looking like it was Cod Mornay.
Whilst sat outside the restaurant, another couple on the end table tried to spirit themselves away without paying, but the eagle-eyed staff noticed and ran after them, card machine in hand and got them to cough up what they had tried to avoid paying.
The sun is all but gone by the time we move on. We find we are close to the Time Out Market, so we have a wander through it to have a look. It is full and buzzy with lots of food options and certainly somewhere to think about coming back to on another evening.
We are now heading in the vague direction of the hotel. There are more squares. Buildings are being lit up. There are lots of interesting vehicles trying to entice tourists in for tours. And there are more steep uphill roads to walk up. That is the thing with guidebook maps. They show the roads and the direction they go in, but there is no mention or indication of the elevation of said roads.
After going up for what seems like a long time, we find ourselves at the top of the route of a different funicular. A quick check shows it goes down to the main drag we have walked along from the hotel earlier in the day, so we hop on.
We did know we had been going uphill for quite some time since leaving the banks of the river, but it is a surprise just how far we had climbed as the funicular ride down took a lot longer than we had imagined it would, and than the earlier one had.
When we had been going in the opposite direction earlier, the side of the road we walk along now had been full of market stalls, but they have all packed up and gone, only to leave behind the occasional café or restaurant which had been disguised by the surrounding stalls earlier.
There are lots of billboards up around the city as there had been when we were in Budapest, as there are elections on the way. I know it isn’t the correct interpretation, but I’m not sure I would be voting for someone with a slogan of Zero Future.
What had been intended to be a quick mooch about became six hours. Six very enjoyable hours, but now bed, and rest is calling us as there will be a lot more hours, so much more to see, and difficult food choices to be made for the next four days to come.

Of course, Hybrid Work is not only a campaign to us. Therefore, we want to introduce you to our colleagues that work from everywhere as digital nomads for diconium. Read further to see how Verena experienced her workation in beautiful Lisbon.
“Oh, you worked from Lisbon?” That was a common response to my explanation that I didn’t take a six-month sabbatical in Portugal, but simply moved the home office to the sun.
But back to the beginning: in October 2021, I took my first workation. Two weeks in Portugal — first Lisbon, then Porto — together with my colleague Lena. And that’s when a thought came up: Why not just stay longer? No sooner said than done. At the end of February 2022, it was time: I said goodbye to Stuttgart and boarded a plane heading south. Looking forward to warm spring days, lots of sun and much better weather than in Germany. Nice dream. It may sound surprising, but it also rains in Lisbon. A lot. Until April. But hey, somehow it was still nice to spend this “April weather” somewhere else.

Why Lisbon, you might ask yourselves? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city where you can find everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses, a thriving nightlife, the most beautiful beaches within reach, good restaurants and cafes, relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life. Oh yes, of course we also have an office there. Little has changed in my day-to-day work. The same projects, the same colleagues, even before mostly remote — now I just had to get up an hour earlier. But it still felt easier.
“Why Lisbon, actually? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city that has everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses…relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life.”
The positive attitude towards life and the joy that this city carries also has a positive effect on my work. I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days. Lisbon simply invites you to leave the house also later in the evening, because there is so much to discover and see. And bang — it’s the weekend again. And in good Portuguese style, you simply enjoy it on the beach. You don’t need a vacation for that, it’s just a normal Saturday. Crazy, isn’t it?
“I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days.”
But I want to share something else: The biggest learning for me was how much I miss the physical meetings with my colleagues (even though I can’t count on one hand how many of them made a trip to Lisbon during my stay). Especially after things became a bit more open and dynamic again after two years remote work, I felt like I was stuck in the pandemic for even longer in my daily work life in Lisbon. Although I visited the Lisbon office, I did not meet my colleagues I’m directly working with. Therefore, every visit I made to our offices in Germany during this time showed me again how valuable these face to face interactions are — both on a human level and for the project progress. Just locking yourself and your team in a room for half a day helps move the project forward. And honestly? As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues again regularly.
“As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues regularly.”
Don’t get me wrong, there’s something about sitting in a café on the beach and working from there — provided the internet connection is stable and the noise level is kept in check. Big shoutout to Teams for providing virtual backgrounds! That’s why I’m already very excited about where I’ll be going next and for how long. Because there is no doubt that I’ll be on another Workation. But in the end it is always nice to come back home.

In my previous article for Live View, I discussed the cameras I decided to bring along on a trip my wife and I planned for six months or more. The trip would start from Lisbon, voyage briefly to Tangiers, and then cruise along the coast of Andalusia to Barcelona. I wanted to travel light but be prepared to do justice to the places I would be seeing for the first, and possibly only, time.
Now we are in the midst of that trip. This article is a report on how things have worked out so far for me and my photography, as illustrated by what I saw in Lisbon.
To recap, I brought two cameras, my OM Systems OM-1 and my new Fuji X100VI. For the OM-1, I took two lenses — the 12–100mm F/4 and the 8–25mm F/4. At the last minute, I decided to take my 18mm conversion lens for the X100VI, and I’m glad I did. I originally thought that the OM-1 would be fine for all focal lengths, but it turns out that the X100VI with the wide conversion lens is great for small city streets.
Which I used more. On various tours over three days, including dark interiors and bright streets, I used whichever camera seemed appropriate — I carried both. Counting the results, it turns out I used both cameras equally. Six hundred thirty images with the Fuji, 680 for the OM.
When it came to focal lengths, it turns out I used the Fuji with the wide converter 56% of the time —…

Going down for breakfast we were able to get what looked to be the last two free seats in the restaurant. I’m looking down the room thinking it is rammed and being surprised as it wouldn’t appear the hotel is that big. But there is a mirror across the back of the room, so it looks twice the size with twice the people in it, and it was only my third wander around the room before I nearly walked into myself coming the other way and realised what was going on. (Have I said I’m not a morning person?)
I suppose it could be said I’m the weather jinx. The previous afternoon had been warm, so this morning I leave the hotel in shorts, t-shirt, and wearing sunglasses. So of course by the time we got on the first of the tour buses it was overcast and threatening to rain. If I said it was a little changeable during the day it might just about cover the number of times we changed seats, got undercover, back into the open, back undercover, in the open, downstairs, upstairs, downstairs, on and off.
When the sun did break through it was lovely and warm, but on the second of the three bus tour routes the spit spots turned into a torrential downpour, which coincided with exactly where we had planned to get off the bus and explore on foot.
As with many larger cities there are more than one route of HOHO buses in Lisbon. There are lots of places of interest to see, but they are spread out over a wide area, putting them all on one route would mean an exceedingly long bus tour.
We had decided on the blue route first which was more to the east and north of the city. Besides the grand municipal buildings and old churches it is interesting as to what catches the eye when on the tours. Such as the sex shop in a building with an Art Deco female fresco on the wall.
Or the Lisbon Business Centre being in a low rent run down block with ideas above its station.
The name of an ice cream store.
Or even the former gas storage frames.
The route goes through the part of the city which had regeneration for when Lisbon hosted Expo 1998. And there are some very interesting structures to see.
There is always too much to try and take in and with the speed of travel, or the angle you are at on the bus means that I spend a lot of time when back at home wondering what the hell I was trying to take a photo of.
What is not in any doubt is just how steeply undulating the city is. There are a lot of roads the buses go up which I’d not want to attempt driving a car, especially the angle of some of the red light induced hill starts which would be needed.
After a lap of the blue route, we change to the red route, getting part of the way around before the rain forced us downstairs for cover, fortunately picking seats which weren’t still getting leaked on down there. The viewpoint behind raindrop splattered windows is totally different and the opportunity to take photographs is limited. To zero.
We got off where we had planned to at the Jeronimos Monastery, supposedly where the first Pastel de Natas were ever made. It is in a traffic free zone (apart from the tour buses), and it is surrounded by museums. (And parts of the monastery buildings have been converted into museums.)
It is properly tipping it down and so we head into a packed Maritime Museum café for lunch. There are map related items to buy in the gift shop, without having to go into the museum, so always good. And whilst we had been lunching the rain had stopped and the sun was trying to escape the cloud cover.
Only for the rain to come back the moment we step outside. But we are used to rain, and we carry on and have a mooch about, through gardens, under the road and railway and to the riverbank and the immense Monument to the Discoveries on it.
In front of it in the square is a map of the world and on it are places highlighted with dates of when the Portuguese empire arrived there during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries following the footsteps of its famed explorers Vasco de Gama and Ferdinand Magellan.
We are heading back under the road and rail when Helen feels someone close up behind her. There is a woman pawing at her backpack and saying, ‘sorry it was open.’ It most definitely wasn’t the woman was blatantly trying to rob Helen. Fortunately, the front pocket was only full of tissues, and her phone and purse were at the bottom of the main compartment buried under lots of other stuff like a jumper and scarf. But whilst checking there was nothing missing the woman and her sidekick had scuttled off as fast as they could and were nowhere to be seen when we were back up at street level. The would-be thief may have got fuck all, but it did shake Helen up and meant she was reluctant to use the backpack as a backpack for the rest of the day and was ultra wary about anyone being close behind her at all.
It began to brighten as we continued to wander around Belem, but we didn’t stop and pick the bus back up at the same point, instead we ended up walking back towards the large suspension bridge.
This meant a detour over a footbridge spanning the road and railway and out onto the roof of one of the MAAT buildings, giving a good view of the other older one.
And of the suspension bridge, built to look like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, it is painted in the same plum colour paint (which is the best colour to be seen in the fog), but is a bit shorter.
Behind it on the hill on the south of the river is the statue Christ the King, like a smaller version of Christ the Redeemer in Rio, more like Christ the Reduced. They do like a copy.
The bridge is called the April 25th Bridge, a nod to the 1974 revolution. It had been shrouded in mist when we had come past it on the bus earlier.
We walked back to under the bridge before reacquainting ourselves with the HOHO bus tours, retracing part of the route we had done before (downstairs in the dry at the time), and past the Belem tower.
Another shower forced us back undercover, and moving back out from the cover just happened to coincide with passing the Basilica, one of the more spectacular churches of the city, and I missed the chance to get a photo of it completely.
Before the loop was complete, we jumped off to change to the green route for a couple of stops to get us up the steep narrow winding streets to the castle. It is easy to see why this route uses a minibus. The route certainly makes me want to reiterate my reluctance to ever want to drive on these streets in a car.
The plan is to get to the castle so that we can catch the 5pm walking tour included with the HOHO tickets. Which we just about manage.
The tour guide in Guilherme, and he is from Brazil, and is doing the tour in English and Spanish, which just blows my mind as I can only just about manage the one language, and even that needs to be carried around in a bucket most of the time.
From the high point next to the castle entrance we have a slow meander down to the river stopping at key points to have things pointed out and for little pieces of the history of the city imparted to us.
One is at the statue of St Vincent (patron saint of the city),
And the viewpoint down from the plaza there, over the terracotta roofs to the river, and across to the church of St Vincent on another hill,
And the dome of the National Pantheon housed in a former church.
We pass a tree which looks like it roots have escaped from the soil and are on an acid trip induced adventure.
There is a quick poke inside the cathedral (which we are likely to return to later in the week).
And then it is down to the river side, stopping at the spiky house.
And finally into the Commerce Square in front of the grand arch, which we had passed through on our little stroll the evening before.
It was a good tour, lasting a lot longer than the advertised hour, and there was even a recommendation of a post tour restaurant for dinner. Which had massive portions of lovely food at reasonable prices. Such sized portions it was probably a good idea there was a walk back up to the hotel involved afterwards.
Those twelve hours had flown by. Time for rest and to get ready to do it all again tomorrow. More buses and a boat tour to come.

There are few things more iconic than leaving rainy London in search of sunnier skies — only to land in Portugal to find… more rain.
Welcome to Lisbon, land of seven hills, centuries of charm, and one of the soggiest weekends I’ve ever had. And somehow, it was still magical.
We arrived bright-eyed, hopeful, and wildly underdressed. The UK, of course, had decided to be 22°C and sunny that weekend, while Lisbon greeted us with a torrential downpour.
After squelching to our hotel, Portobay Liberdade, we regrouped and, now lightly towel-dried, swam our way to a nearby Italian spot (Il Basilico, I think?) for a bite. My travel companion’s trainers were instantly soaked, turning a casual stroll into a mission: Operation Waterproof Shoe Hunt.
Easier said than done. Lisbon’s got many things — views, wine, vintage tiles, but trainers shops? Not in a monsoon.
That first day? Honestly, a washout. But then, we stumbled into dinner. And let me tell you, it was a revelation.
After drying off from our soggy adventures, we chose to dine in our hotel that night at Bistro 6, and it was one of the most fantastic choices we made. The duck was remarkable: Crispy on the outside, tender and rich on the inside, with a wonderful depth of flavour present in every bite. It was so good that even in a city as full of culinary gems as Lisbon, we couldn’t resist going back for round two. I’m pretty sure I’ll be daydreaming about that plate for years to come.
By morning, we gave in to our fate. Lisbon was going to soak us, and we were going to like it. Jackets on, umbrellas up (luckily supplied by the hotel), optimism renewed.
First stop: the Mercado da Ribeira (aka Time Out Market Lisbon). Our first-ever Time Out Market and it set the bar high. It wasn’t your typical chaotic food court, instead, it felt like a well-curated space with an incredible variety of options. From fresh seafood and gourmet croquettes to decadent handmade chocolates, there was something for every craving. The place was organised yet vibrant, buzzing with energy.
If you’re new in town, it’s the perfect place to meet people: everyone sits together, it’s lively, communal, and thriving.
We grabbed a doughnut (incredible!!), a couple of coffees, then wandered through the traditional market tucked behind the main hall. Fishmongers shouting, locals shopping, fruit stacked high, there was a real sense of the city coming to life. We were completely captivated.
Next, we set off to see Lisbon Cathedral (Sé) and try our luck with Tram 28, Lisbon’s charmingly vintage and famously packed transit option. While we waited in the drizzle, we were approached by a charismatic Parisian tour guide, offering a covered tuk-tuk ride through the city.
Usually, we’d run from that kind of pitch, but he had a roof, plastic sides, and an irresistible charm. Reader, we climbed aboard.Best decision of the trip.
He took us through the seven hills of Lisbon, shared history with passion, pointed out hidden spots we’d never have found on our own, and gave us time to really enjoy the views, not just tick them off a list.
Oh, and at our very first miradouro (viewpoint), someone proposed right next to us. Cue tears. Lisbon, suddenly, wasn’t just rainy — it was romantic.
We ended the day at Praça do Comércio, where the weather finally gave us a break. Picture this: three grand golden-yellow façades on three sides…and then, nothing. Just open sky and the wide, rolling Tagus River, looking more like a calm ocean than a river. It was one of the most unexpectedly stunning squares I’ve ever stood in.
With a glass of wine in hand and the wind finally drying our coats, we toasted to Lisbon’s stubborn beauty.
Sunday morning brought us to Belém — land of custard tarts and monumental queues. Our attempt to visit Jerónimos Monastery failed (read: misunderstood the queue and were politely turned away), but fate had better plans: we headed early to Pastéis de Belém instead.And thank everything holy we did.
This place is a Lisbon legend. From the outside, it looks like a pleasant café. But inside? It’s a labyrinth of awning-covered rooms, waiters by the dozen, and pastries by the thousands. Somehow, we snagged a table.
Between the two of us, we ordered at least six pastries — custards, almond cakes, an orange thing I can’t explain — and two coffees. The bill? €10 total. I don’t know how. I don’t care. I would’ve paid triple.
We even brought some back to the UK with us. That’s how good they were.
We wandered through Alfama and Old Town Lisbon on our last day, taking in the steep streets, the tiled walls, the laundry flapping above us. If I can give you one travel tip for Lisbon, it’s this:
Do not come with a new hip. Or bad knees. Or any aversion to steep climbs.Lisbon is beautifully vertical. Like, mountain goat vertical. My poor mum (fresh from hip surgery) was a trooper, but fair warning: this city is cardio with a capital C.
So, was it the sun-soaked European weekend I imagined? No.Was it a glorious, rain-drenched, pastry-fueled, unexpectedly beguiling adventure? Absolutely.
Lisbon is a city that sneaks up on you. It’s tiled facades and rooftop views, ghost stories in ancient cathedrals, and secret tarts tucked in glass counters. It’s fascinating markets and quiet moments, and unexpected friendships with French tuk-tuk drivers.
It’s a city I’ll absolutely come back to, preferably with better footwear, a lighter raincoat, and the same appetite for surprises.

I love reading fiction, writing when the mood strikes, and pottering outside when the sun comes out. Love art, travel, and catching a West End show when I can.

Having been woken up by an unpleasant noise I hear every morning Monday through Friday, I peeked at the darkness still reluctant to get up and saw nothing but furniture shapes. This time, I was quite thrilled to kick off the day because in just a few hours I would walk the streets of a city I never thought I’d visit.
Fast forward a couple of hours, a few airport checks and check-ins and one transit flight and I was finally there. Oh yes, and my arm was sore from carrying a few suitcases (thanks to my girlfriend), with that feeling of exhaustion as if coming home after a whole day’s work and a mediocre meal and no leg space for a 190-cm guy which caused me to twist and turn in my seat. But that’s the economy class ticket benefit you don’t get anywhere else. It is the airport company’s fault but I do often get — “Well, why are you that tall?”
Other than these minor inconveniences, the flight was good. I was here. Stepping out of the plane and walking for a change was a true remedy. I heard a whispering “Thank you” from my back and knees as I was willowing towards an airport exit.
Outside, palm trees dwarfed every building around it as they stood proudly, defying gravity. Above, the clear sky was chasing away the dark clouds that gathered in the night to water the city. They knew Lisbon was awaiting guests. The air was quite refreshing and it filled my lungs with energy after every breath. Comparing it to the cold Belgrade air, which is best felt with the scarf wrapped around your mouth, was pointless. It was a true marathon to get to the destination, yet I was more than eager to get the tour started. I couldn’t wait to see what the city had to offer.
The spring sun was shining bright. It is one of those days where you take your jacket with you, but it is warm enough during the day and you don’t need it. If you sit down, you can feel the wind creeping up your shirt sleeves, giving you goosebumps. So with my jacket on and off and on and off again, I was strolling the old parts of Lisbon.
Each building, house and structure of any kind, whether historical or not was a story for itself thanks to the bright blue, yellowish and white tiles covering it. The tiles, called azulejos, were used as decoration, but also to protect the buildings from the salty river and ocean air. It is the first thing that catches the eye, together with different kinds of tiles laid under your feet. Those painted pictures of ships, seas, winds and other things on the squares, streets, and sidewalks.
Walking through the city street I was faced with the dilemma to look down and up, as vibrant colors were everywhere with tiles reflecting the sun, giving you the warm and cozy feeling of familiarity and admiration.
It took me a while to fight against the hilly terrain to get to what I consider to be the main square — Praca do Comercio. It offers a marvelous view of the Tagus river which shows its full power exactly at this place, pushing the coast to the sides, stretching out as much as possible. One might be tricked to consider this to be the sea, partly due to the pleasant breeze coming at you. However, it is just the spot where you can see the full power and potential of nature, as the river narrows down a bit further “down the road” before it collides with the vastness of the cold and blue Atlantic. Seagulls are flying around, their song mixing with the people murmur and tram’s racket.
A few tiny white sails were seen on the river, while across, the remaining parts of the city are calling you to explore them, with much more greenery and sparse buildings.
The welcoming atmosphere invites you to sit on the curb, even in one of the surrounding cafes and just soak in everything around you. And that’s what I did. The sounds, the smells the view. It is all one needs to know about a city to recognize its soul, and it didn’t take me long to see Lisbon as my own.
As the sun retreats, the tiredness due to miles of walking and exploring caught up with me again, but just like upon the arrival, it was mixed with pleasure and peace.
And the sunsets…true Lisbon colors show up, the ones you cannot see during the day. With the remains of the day, the rush is over and satisfaction is painted on every face you encounter, tourist or local.
Sleep catches with you quickly when you lie down. I cannot remember what happened, but it was morning again. And that awful alarm sound, although it felt better this time. Getting down to the hotel lobby by elevator felt a bit painful due to aching in my legs, yet there was no choice. The city was calling me out to turn every corner, see every tile and smell the air from hills and valleys.
Alfama is a city within a city. I decided to walk across it and it was a mistake from the start. Uphill and downhill terrain made this area specific, with no flat parts. To me, it all seemed uphill, especially after a few hours. Luckily, you can get on the vintage yellow tram which is one of the symbols of the city and ride up, before you get off and walk uphill. Again. Endless elevation. And just like the other areas, Alfama is colorful and vibrant but there’s something special about it, something mysterious that I couldn’t define.
My stomach started complaining, which meant that the entire itinerary changed and the first place I wanted to get to was the restaurant. Suddenly, all those historical places became “meh” as human biology stepped in.
Lisbon is a perfect city for fish lovers. Fish is all over the menus and all I desired at that point was salmon — and boy, oh boy, it was terrific. Add a squeeze of lemon on top of it, with a fresh salad as the side dish and it is a perfect combination. No bones to pick just a light yet fulfilling meal.
While all of that was happening, a fado trio was playing the background, a local band, performing here and there, and it was all that was missing. They hit the right note as the sun was setting over Alfama.
The moment I landed at the Belgrade airport, I was happy to be home, yet sadness filled my inner being. The city was grey and colorless, with people rushing all over the place, going in the wrong direction. It was cold outside and the cold reached all the way to my bones. I already missed the sunny hillsides and building tops, the uneven grounds and the atmosphere which seemed to be more welcoming.
I was back in my everyday routine. Yet, on every cloudy and misty day, I remember the Lisbon sun, shining bright!
Until we meet again!

With the sun beating down on me and a temperature of over 28°C, I see a fellow runner lying on the curb being attended to by first responders. I check my watch and decide to stop once again at the next water station. This is going to be much tougher than I expected…
My journey to the 2017 Lisbon Marathon started in the winter of 2015. I was busy assembling IKEA furniture when I was struck by a burning pain in my knee that refused to go away. For the next few days it continued to get worse and every small stair suddenly became a major challenge. Finally, I decided to see an orthopedist. I never really liked (or had much reason) to see a doctor, but I had just turned 45, my girlfriend Anna was pregnant with our daughter and I figured getting it checked out would be the responsible thing to do.
The visit ended with a referral for an MRI that led to a nasty surprise. The cartilage in my knees was considerably damaged. These injuries had been looming for some time as I continued to ignore the warning signs. The diagnosis was clear. I would now be required to get a sodium hyaluronate injection directly into my knee joints every 6 months just to ease the pain. An injection with a price tag of $750 that isn’t covered by any health insurance. To add insult to injury, the doctor casually said, “Look, you may be able to go for a 5-kilometer jog, and you should do that regularly, but nothing longer. Take it easy, you will never be able to run a marathon, so don’t bother trying.” These comments resonated in me for a long time. I never even considered running a marathon — until this very moment.
I have always seen myself as a member of the running community, but frankly, my laps through the park had become less frequent over the years. There was the occasional spring onset of daily runs that lasted for about a month, but they were never farther than 5 to 10k. The longest distance I had ever run was a 25k race but that was only once and it was over 20 years ago. So, I could have been content with injections twice a year and back to a rather normal life. Only that I wasn’t.
The most urgent issue I wanted to focus on was the pain. I started reading a lot about treatment options and I decided to try something other than getting needles jammed into my knees. After a bit of experimentation, I found that taking a high dose daily (2000 mg) of glucosamine sulphate was starting to help me. Later, I added omega 3 and collagen to the mix. After a couple of weeks the burning sensation went away. I had indeed found an alternative for my battered knees.
Please bear with me, in one of my former lives I was also a lawyer: This is what worked for me, but no medical advice whatsoever is intended.
The following year I wasn’t really prioritizing my running career. Throughout all of 2016, I covered a total distance of less than 60 km in twelve runs. Yes, I had a lot of other things on my plate, with a newborn baby, being CEO of Berlin’s Innovation Agency and everything else. At least I was sticking to the doctor’s advice when it came to the part of “taking things easy” with my knees. But I had a growing sense that I was missing something. I was somehow able to manage getting everything done — but I was also realizing that I was losing my edge.
New Year’s Eve is always a great time for resolutions. In the years past, I must admit (and you can probably relate), these intentions were rather short-lived. But this time I was hell-bent to make a change for real. So I came up with something that seemed utterly beyond reach: For 2017 I resolved to run a marathon. And to make things more interesting, I didn’t even consider the Berlin Marathon in my hometown. I was looking for a venue with added value. I soon found Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, located at the River Tagus and the Atlantic Ocean, one of the most fascinating cities in Europe. With the race scheduled for October 15th, this would leave me enough time to find out if my knees would keep up with my ambitions.
The first thing I did was to read about marathon training. There are many manuals and programs out there. The takeaway lesson was: Run frequently, consistently including workouts for speed, stamina, and mobility and run a reasonable number of longer runs that should include a 30+ km run in the weeks before the event. This means you must spend a lot of time and you must spend it regularly. Marathon training is an exercise in discipline and commitment, that much I realized. Wait, I only had time for two handfuls of recreational runs in 2016 and (what I thought to be) insufficient sleep due to our baby’s somewhat erratic sleep patterns, a demanding job and, last but not least, a relationship to cherish. Sounds like something straight from the playbook of Mission Impossible, doesn’t it?
Nevertheless, I came up with a plan. I set 2 milestones that would serve as my intermediate goals: The 10k City Night race in Berlin on July 29th along the famous Kurfürstendamm Boulevard and the Stadtlauf Berlin half marathon on August 20th. If I could complete both within a reasonable time and my knees would be functional afterwards I would book the flights to Lisbon. After registering for both races, I started running 5 kilometers on January 3rd along the icy shores of Schlachtensee Lake, which would become my favorite route for the next couple of months.
With the marathon still in the “distant” future, the winter runs that followed were a bit sporadic. Eventually I had to figure out how to fit my training into my daily routine and the only solution I came up with was to get up early. And I mean really early, at 4:30 am.
There has been a lot written about the benefits of starting your day off early and I must say, it’s totally true! Starting your work day after you have spent some time working out is great. Having a daily sense of achievement after logging 10 or 20 km before you start breakfast is truly awesome. Having the chance to focus on your thoughts while enjoying the sunrise is priceless. So, over the next few months, I was running regularly and enjoying the slow and steady progress I was making.
Both tests I recklessly scheduled quite close to the big day went well, so I booked the flights and a very nice apartment in Lisbon’s historic Alfama district. Finally, it was going to happen. I would run at the Lisbon Marathon!
In the final week before the race one issue became increasingly pressing — the weather forecast. When I had the idea of flying to Portugal for my first ever marathon, I of course checked the weather information. On average you can expect 20°C in the middle of October. But not this year, the forecast was 31°C with clear skies. The 2006 Chicago Marathon had to be shut down with the mercury at 28°C but I expected that in sunny Portugal this wouldn’t even be considered. So, I frantically worked on adapting my gear. It is a good thing that you reduce your training miles leading up to the race (a.k.a. tapering), so you can take care of these kinds of things.
However, speaking of reduced miles, another question started nagging me. Did I train enough? Even though I ran nearly every day in the weeks prior to Lisbon, I never ran a distance longer than 25 km. But on the other hand, 15 km was one of my regular morning runs, so the additional stretch should be manageable, right? Since there was no chance I could redo my training plan in the next few days, I decided to relax. The race day would prove if my reasoning was right.
I arrived Thursday evening in Lisbon to acclimate myself and focus on the challenge ahead. It was a luxury to have time to think and I enjoyed doing so at the marathon’s designated finish at Praça do Comércio. Here, you have a wonderful view over River Tagus’ final passage before joining the Atlantic Ocean. It became my “vision quest” as my girlfriend Anna would call it. She has always been supportive of my aspirations. Although we originally planned to make the trip to Lisbon together, Anna decided to stay at home with our young daughter and this gave me the gift of time alone. I used it well and came up with a list of goals and dreams for my future.
Finally, the day of the race dawned and I was sitting on the train from Lisbon to Cascais jammed with marathoners in various degrees of contemplation. Some were sitting on the floor with an empty look on their face, others were chatting happily away with their running buddies or texting home. I was silently rehearsing my game plan: Stick to the well-trained pace of 5:30, don’t get carried away by competing with other runners in the first 20 or so km, pick up the pace at 30 km aiming at a negative split, finish sub 4:00 hours.
And I stuck to the plan, at least for the first 20 km. After crossing the starting line in a wave of euphoria I was soon running steadily. I found the waving flag of the 4 hour pacemaker I was going to follow until the half marathon mark and the first misting station was in sight.
Then something unexpected happened. The heart rate display on my watch jumped to an unreal 202 bpm and I forced myself to slow down. Around 175 bpm would have been the “normal” maximum for a person of my age. Today, looking back at the data, I’m sure that this reading was erroneous because I have never again gone over a 170 bpm. At the time, I only had the information on my display and it had a tremendous impact. I suddenly realized that I still had another half marathon to go and the sun was beating down mercilessly even though it wasn’t even 10 a.m. yet. I checked my knees for any signs of pain or weakness. Had I overestimated myself? How could I have believed that with only months of training I would be able to pull this off? I already envisioned myself collapsing at the roundabout near the beach of Carcavelos.
This was the point where I was (to be honest for the first time really) awestruck by the magnitude of the marathon as a test of body and mind. I considered my options. I could stop now and justify it with the parching heat and my staggering heart rate. But in the end, I decided to follow through, no matter what. My goal had changed. Certainly, I still wanted to finish with a time that would be to the best of my abilities, but I mainly focused on not being defeated. I would slow down, I would drink whenever possible, I would even walk any uphill stretches of the course. The reason I started this endeavor in the first place was to prove to myself that it was still possible to accomplish something really demanding and to push my limits. This would become my mantra for the next kilometers to come.
And those kilometers weren’t easy. In fact, I never experience the famous “runner’s high”, at least not while I was running. The last 10 km became an uncomfortable rhythm of moving along an agonizing 2.5 km stretch only to reach the next water station, drinking and cooling myself, and starting all over again, but it worked. After I had passed the 40 km mark the number of cheering spectators increased significantly. That gave me the final boost to give the backup goal I cooked up with while poking along the torrid Avenida Marginal a try: Finishing at 4:30.
With a final sprint I reached the finish line at 4:30:54!
After hitting the stop button on my sports watch I felt exhausted but otherwise amazingly good. No cramps, no sore muscles even in the days following the race. Interestingly enough, the knees that brought me there also carried me throughout the whole distance without any problems. So, on a physiological level, it is safe to say that the stress I put on my body was easily absorbed.
The marathon had both a short and long term impact on my psychology as well. It all started with the continuous effort I put into my training despite all the seemingly “good” reasons why there wasn’t enough time. Once I made up my mind and committed myself to the marathon, I magically found ways to make it happen. I was able to build up my knees by training and through supplements with no side effects based on the research I did. I was able to regain my confidence and mental strength on a very fundamental level. And I was able to apply all of this to master the challenge the Lisbon Marathon turned out to be.
After I had taken a cold shower in my apartment and devoured a carb-laden lunch, I immediately went back onto the streets of Lisbon for a walk. I noticed a shift in my perspective that is still present today. A lot of things suddenly felt shallow and dispensable, others became much more significant, like sharpening the focus of my mental map. And I started working towards reaching some of the most important goals that I had identified just days before.
So, it once again proves to be true: Every cloud has a silver lining. When I got the news of my supposedly ruined knees, it seemed to be the end of my running days. But instead, this was just the beginning! It has forced me to make decisions about how I want to live my life. I opted for the challenges and that has allowed me to grow beyond my athletic ambitions. You gain nothing by accepting your fate, you must keep on fighting if you want to win.

Lisbon is a city of seven hills. And I am the queen of one of them, for three days. But if I go down a hill, I must climb up again.
The charm of Lisbon is its narrow lanes and endless steps lined by colorful azulejos (tile) covered buildings. The beauty of Lisbon is its hills and plentiful viewpoints with panoramic views. To climb these hills, you’d need good food to fuel your stamina. The good news is, delicious food is everywhere for every budget.
Since we had been to Lisbon once many years ago, this time we decided not to cram a tourist checklist into our three-day stay.
We were first captivated by the sweeping view from Miradouro de Santa Catarina (Viewpoint of Saint Catarina), within a short walk from where we are staying. The grand Tagus River and the red tile roofs beneath glow in the warm sun, and Christ the King statue stands tall in the distance across the river. Both locals and tourists enjoy having a drink at Noobai rooftop bar and restaurant. We didn’t have a chance to catch the sunset there but it is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view. There is also…

When I was first thinking about moving to Germany, the appeal was pretty clear: Germany is an economic powerhouse, one of the strongest economies in the world. I thought to myself, “Okay, if I move there, I’m making a smart decision for my career.” And even though Berlin wasn’t exactly my first choice, I figured it would work as a starting point.
Fast forward six years, and I’m feeling stuck both personally and professionally and I’m starting to question the environment I’m in.
Feeling stuck? I wrote about why settling in one place can actually be dangerous for your growth. If you’re curious, check it out here: Why Settling in One Place Can Be Dangerous for Your Growth.
But, let’s get to the real reason I’m writing this post: Lisbon.
I recently visited Lisbon for the first time, and let me tell you, I was shocked in the best way possible, I was still taken aback by how much I loved it.
The streets were clean, the infrastructure was solid, and public transportation actually worked well enough to make getting around a breeze. But what really stood out to me was the overall vibe of the city. It just felt… ordered.
There was this balance of modernity and tradition, Lisbon had this richness that Berlin doesn’t always capture, at least not in the same way. It’s not just in the food and the gorgeous architecture, but in the way the city feels. The people were welcoming, the atmosphere felt peaceful and grounded — everything just felt a little… livable.
The streets didn’t feel unsafe or disorderly, and I didn’t have to dodge random bottles or step over anything unpleasant. It felt clean — and not just physically, but in terms of its overall atmosphere. Lisbon felt way more laid-back and balanced — a place where I could actually imagine calling home.
On my way back to Berlin I find myself wondering… could Lisbon be the place for me? Maybe it’s time to seriously think about it. But … As much as I’ve dreamt about moving to Lisbon, my hopes have taken a bit of a hit.
Lisbon used to have a reputation for being more affordable than other European capitals, but the reality is, rent prices have been climbing steadily — especially in the trendy neighborhoods — bringing them in line with cities like Berlin!
On top of that, salaries in Lisbon are still pretty low compared to other European cities, so the cost of living isn’t as balanced as I once thought. It’s a bummer, but looks like my dream of settling in Lisbon it didn’t last too long!
So here I am again, chasing the original plan moving to Munich. Although is one of the most expensive places to live in Germany, at least the salaries are around 30% higher than what I’ve been offered in Berlin!
But even with the potential for a bigger paycheck, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just stuck in this loop of chasing after cities that are becoming increasingly expensive while the job market still feels a bit of a mirage!
The whole “Germany has tons of job opportunities” narrative is, well, not exactly the truth. Anyone who’s actually lives here knows how tough it can be to land a job, even if you speak German at a C2 level. The competition is fierce, and sometimes it feels like it doesn’t matter how qualified you are.
Sure, the western and the southern part of Germany is still financially doing well, but if the job hunt keeps feeling this grim, it might just be time to explore other options. It’s a tough decision, but I’m honestly getting a little tired of hitting dead ends. I’m even starting to entertain the idea of leaving the country altogether.
Sadly, Lisbon will remain in my heart as a city that surprised me and gave me some amazing daydreams of a life where I could see smiles around and feel a sense of calm in the everyday. It’s the kind of place that makes you think, “This could be home,” but sometimes, reality just doesn’t align with those dreams.
I’m thinking about where to go next. I’ve got some exciting options on my mind, if you’re curious, check it out here: I’m Leaving Berlin. Let me know your thoughts!

Shannon is behind one of Lisbon’s coolest coding school: Le Wagon. We met at Beta-i and got curious to know more about her story and how you start such a project from scratch without being from the city yourself. Time for some questions!
I moved here four years ago to be with my boyfriend who is from Lisbon. I never imagined at that time that I would still be here four years on, but the city has been changing (for the good) at such an alarming rate in the last few years that I feel like I moved somewhere new.
Rather than why I came to live here, the better question is why I stayed. And to answer that, you can read a blog post I published a few weeks ago on Le Wagon — Why would you relocate to Lisbon?
www.lewagon.com
Le Wagon is a code school for non-technical entrepreneurs and creatives. We give people the programming and product development mindset through teaching ruby on rails web development.
My motivation to launch Le Wagon started two years ago while I was working in a local accelerator/ incubator here in Lisbon. I saw a lack of technical talent amongst the founders and also felt that I could benefit myself from understanding on a basic level what is going on behind the scenes of software.
Now, after having gone through the program myself and already running three 9 week batches in Lisbon, I can say I know that and a whole lot more, plus have 60+ Lisbon alumni as a support when it comes to launching my own products and finding cool jobs in the tech market.
Growing very quickly with a very diverse mix of internationals and locals.
We really wanted to be immersed in Lisbon’s startup ecosystem and Beta-i was a great way to access this community.
We could do a better job of this to be honest. At the moment, we are cross promoting events and of course enjoying some impromptu beers on the roof :)
Learning how to learn (again) — their EGOS! As humans, we are conditioned to shy away from challenge. We want all the glory with all the ease. We tend to work in areas and take on tasks that make us feel good. The first three weeks of Le Wagon are an ice cold shower for those that are not accustomed to just not getting something in the beginning. You really have to have faith in yourself and our curriculum when you start the program. The concepts are abstract for most people and they need to time sink in. Le Wagon is like learning to ride a bike. You have to be willing to keep getting on the bike and falling off and trust that eventually if you do that enough times, it will click and you’ll start riding.
To keep the students believing in themselves and their ability. To keep “falling off the bike”.
In our first batch, we had a student that really struggled. And when I say struggled, there were days he didn’t finish a challenge. But the guy had a great attitude. He didn’t give up. He didn’t compare himself to his classmates. He just kept going. After the bootcamp, he was one of the first to get a job and not even in ruby — in Javascript on the backend! He is our mascot here in Lisbon on what it means to give it your all.
Our community is growing locally. We expect in the next year to have our own space with our own cowering for our alumni and ruby on rails developers.
Thanks Shannon for your time and insights!

Here at Salsify, we can’t stop talking about our brand spankin’ new office and team in Lisbon, Portugal! We do love Boston, but nothing can top the beautiful sunny weather and gorgeous beaches of Lisbon. I recently got the chance to sit down with our People Operations Specialist in Portugal, Marta Carvalho, to get her take on Lisbon, Boston, and all things Salsify!
Q: So, what exactly does a People Operations Specialist do?
A: As a part of the People Ops team, it’s my responsibility to promote employee engagement and brand awareness, onboard new hires, support HR processes, team building, and a lot of other fun stuff! Since we are just getting started in Lisbon, my current work is very focused on building and growing the Lisbon team, and ramping up the Salsify employment brand in Lisbon.
Q: How long have you been working for Salsify?
A: A little over one month.
Q: How did you find out about Salsify?
A: I heard about Salsify coming to Lisbon through networking in the Lisbon tech community.
Q: What made you want to work for Salsify?
A: The opportunity to do what I really love in a company with great culture and values. It’s great to be part of this project since the beginning. Plus, I have the opportunity to be a pioneering person in HR and to think, implement, and see through the best policies and procedures!
Q: What is it like working for Salsify versus working for a Portuguese company?
A: For me, the possibility of traveling and working in collaboration with Boston colleagues on a daily basis is something that I really love. Plus, Portuguese companies tend to have long and inconclusive personal meetings! I’ve been struggling a lot with this in my last years :) I’m delighted that things at Salsify are done promptly, on time, and focus on specific goals. I feel that people here are very productive and efficient.
Q: What is the biggest cultural difference that you’ve encountered between Portugal and the United States?
A: Well . . . you all seem to have lunch and dinner pretty early :) I’m used to having dinner by 9 pm for instance while in Boston, it was super common to have dinner by 6 pm. It feels like days and nights in Portugal take longer.
Q: What has been your favorite and least favorite thing about working for Salsify so far?
A: Favorite thing is probably the possibility to work with such a great and friendly team. Least favorite thing is the current temporary office, which is about to change when we move to a new office full of windows and sunshine!
(We actually just moved to our new office! Check it out here.)
Q: Are you someone who can listen to music while you work?
A: Only during some tasks. If I’m doing some sourcing or replying to some emails, then yes. If I need to think about something more strategic or write down policies and procedures, I can’t.
Q: Where in the world would you most like to travel?
A: There are so many places I would like to go that it’s hard to pick out only one. I love sun and beaches, so anything that seems like a paradise are good destinations (Hawaii, Bahamas, Bali…).
Q: Do you have a hidden talent/fact that most people don’t know about you?
A: Well, I dance a lot of Salsa and Bachata. I’m not sure if it is a talent, but it’s something I love to do and I know how to do it.
Q: Tea or coffee?
A: Coffee for sure. Not a fan of tea, only drink it when I’m sick. Tea does not bring me good memories :)
Q: Reading or watching TV?
A: Both. Love to see a good movie or also to do some binge watching on Netflix. However, also love to take a book to Starbucks (yes, Starbucks is very appreciated in Lisbon!) or a nice coffee shop and read it on a rainy day.
Q: What is your favorite thing about Lisbon?
A: What keeps me in Lisbon is definitely being close to my family. Also, our sunny days, good food, and great sights to see make me love Lisbon. What I like the most is the possibility to go to the beach in fifteen minutes from my home! Even in winter, the sun stills shines here and you can have a good time on a nice terrace on the beach.
Q: Best lunch spot in Lisbon?
A: There are so many. Food in Lisbon is the best. I like to go to Portugalia, in Belem (but more because of the space rather than the food).Q: You recently visited the Boston office! Was this your first time in Boston? How did you like it?
A: Just loved it! It was my first time in the US and I was delighted. The first few days were pretty tough. Never felt so much cold in my entire life! But I loved to see the city with and without the snow. You have a beautiful city and compared to Lisbon, everything is so big. I felt very welcome by the whole team and got really impressed about how big we are in Boston. Looking forward to create something similar in Lisbon.
Q: What are you most excited about moving forward?
A: I love the creation processes of everything. So, very excited about creating the Lisbon Team and to set all things for the creation of our offices as well.
Obrigado, Marta, for letting us get to know you and Portugal a bit better! Check out our careers page for more info about all of our amazing job openings, and be sure to follow us on Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter for all the Salsify updates you could ever want.

Haven’t joined Medium yet but still want to read my story? Fine. Click Here
This was a museum that caught my eye when we did our ‘buzz through’ visit to Lisbon in February. Portugal has a centuries long maritime tradition for exploration, military and commercial enterprise and since world history is a subject I’m a little interested in, I put it on the list.
We came back to Lisbon near the end of March and after quite a little bit of ‘what do we want to see?’ conversation, we purchased the 72 hour Lisboa Pass which offers free or discounted admission to dozens of attractions.
Located in the Belém district, home to an amazing number of interesting attractions, Museu de Marinha, also known as the Maritime Museum or the Navy museum, is on the list with a 20% discount. So, instead of 7€ (US$7.65 at the time) we were admitted for only US$6.13 each.
The museum is located in one end of the Jerónimos Monastery building, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which is an attraction on its own. One we didn’t visit, BTW.

Let me tell you a story. This one takes us to Lisbon, Portugal, where I went to visit someone who has been my fairy godmother and her amazing husband. To protect her privacy, let’s call her “Ballerina.”
Now, Lisbon was everything you’d imagine, great people, great food, and endless opportunities to learn. Between physics, entropy, mountains, ballet, and Portuguese culture, my mind was buzzing. But, as always, the universe had a peculiar surprise in store for me. You see, Ballerina has this friend, Karma, who happens to be a Tibetan Buddhist Kempo monk. Yes, his name is as amazing as his wisdom. One day, we decided to head to the beach for some sun and sea after I met with folks from the World Bank to brainstorm ways to tackle water scarcity. Pretty typical day, right?
Well, here’s the twist: monks don’t usually carry swim trunks. So, what do you do when your monk friend wants to dip his toes in the ocean? You go and buy him a pink swimsuit, of course. Armed with this purchase, we made our way to the water, chatting about life, music, and whatever else crossed our minds. Turns out, Karma had spent some time in Mexico and spoke Spanish. This led us down a hilarious rabbit hole of Latin music, culminating in a spontaneous rendition of *Despacito*. There we were, a cosmologist, a Buddhist monk, and a theoretical physics PhD student, on a Portuguese beach, singing and dancing to a reggaeton hit. Life’s surreal moments, I tell you.
But wait, there’s more. I’m not exactly an ocean person. I grew up in the Andes, far from any sea, and I didn’t realize how quickly the water could chill me. As the sun set, my body temperature dropped fast, too fast. Ballerina, who, by the way, is not just an award-winning cosmologist and a ballerina but also a seasoned mountaineer, immediately noticed something was off. Her mountaineering instincts kicked in, and she got me out of the water before I turned into a human popsicle. After almost giving her a heart attack with my near-hypothermic state, we bundled me up and made it back home safe.
That trip wasn’t just about beaches, physics, or even *Despacito*. It was about being in the company of some of the most brilliant and fascinating minds I’ve ever met. Karma, in particular, taught me so much about the art of controlling the mind, meditating, and navigating emotions with clarity. It was like a crash course in mastering the internal chaos we all carry.
But more than anything, this trip reminded me of the simple joy in life’s beautiful chaos. The cliff, the mountains, the black cat, the dreams, the tree, the hedgehogs, the sunset, each a little piece of the puzzle. Between deep conversations, fresh ideas, and hours spent playing with their incredible kids, I felt myself rediscovering the wild, curious, and playful side of me. It’s the part that often gets buried under all the equations and theories, but it’s always there, waiting to come alive again.
Life’s better when it surprises you, isn’t it?

It was a nightmare to leave the “Estação Oriente” in Lisbon.
After spending a delightful few days in Porto, I boarded the AP train, eager to return to Lisbon.
The trip took me 3 good hours that I spent writing and communicating with my laptop. The train wifi was working properly.
However, as I arrived at the Lisbon train station (Aug 5), I found myself in an unexpected predicament.
The bustling station was packed with an ocean of people from all corners of the globe, and a wave of claustrophobia washed over me.
I felt in some ways lost and unsure of how to reach my hotel via the subway train.
Navigating through the sea of travelers proved to be a daunting task.
Each person seemed to be in a hurry, and it felt like the entire world had gathered in Lisbon to witness a momentous event — the Pope.
Feeling overwhelmed, I took a moment to compose myself and tried to spot any sign or direction for the subway.
However, it was not easy amidst the crowd. And every escalator was not working.

When I left Paris — after visiting a few cities in France, I headed to Lisbon, Portugal. After all, I was already in Europe. So, why not explore more than just France — thus killing two or three birds with one stone? (No birds were harmed during this trip).
As my Uber driver approached where my hotel was located, I saw a bridge. A long one! And as we got closer, I was taken aback by its resemblance to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
I was like, wait a minute, where am I?
The Ponte 25 de Abril (the 25th of April Bridge in English), connects the city of Lisbon to the municipality of Almada. I later learned that it was built by an American Bridge Company, and one can see where the inspiration for the design came from. The bridge’s upper section accommodates cars and the section under is for trains. However, unlike the Golden Gate Bridge, Ponte 25 de Abril doesn’t allow pedestrians or biking on the bridge.
As I gazed into the distance, I saw a statue. I later read that it was called Christ The King — a Catholic monument and shrine overlooking the city of Lisbon and was inspired by the…

If you’re reading this article, it means you’re hoping to meet new people in Lisbon, that’s awesome! You may be considering moving here permanently, exploring Lisbon as a digital nomad, or you may have lived here for a while and feel like it’s the time to get out there and make new friendships. Whatever the reason, the answer to “How do I begin?” is the same: download the Meetup App.
In case you were wondering why I’m recommending Meetup instead another app: no, I’m not affiliated with Meetup in any way. When I first came to Lisbon at the beginning of 2022, I tried out various apps, and Meetup stood out to me as the one with the most significant number of interesting-sounding events that fill up quickly.
So, in this article, I would love to mention a list of Meetups that I found particularly worthy of checking out. If you think that I missed out on any excellent Meetup event, please leave a comment below so that everyone can benefit :)
The list of great 10 Meetups includes:
Curious Monkey
This is a non-profit group and a creative space for sharing knowledge about art and bringing together local and expat communities in Lisbon. They organize various events, including yoga, open mics, and talks with book authors, journalists, and casts of well-known shows such as Cirque Du Soleil. If you’re looking for some quality conversations, then Curious Monkey will be a great group to join!
www.meetup.com
Drink & Draw
Drink & Draw hosts pop-up drawing sessions in unique locations around Lisbon. For around twenty euros, you can enjoy a mobile-phone-free session with incredible people at a beautiful local winery or a cafe. Each participant is handed a set of drawing materials upon entry and a drink choice, and then the drawing begins! Two or more models pose in the middle of the room, and participants are given tasks such as “draw the model in 30 sec” or “draw the model in 7 min but with the opposite hand.” It’s a lot of fun and an excellent opportunity to explore your drawing technique.
www.meetup.com
Future Founders
I’m a big fan of this group because I always leave their events feeling inspired and with a sense that I learned something new. The group attracts founders, product people, and venture capitalists. It’s the perfect place to obtain or give feedback, discuss technology, and get funding! Some of the events take place in a park where participants gather in small groups to discuss challenges and ideas, and then the groups are swapped every 15–20 min. For those of you who have a business registered in Portugal, this may be an excellent place to learn more about the legal side of things as the group hosts talks dedicated to this topic as well.
www.meetup.com
Lisbon Digital Nomads
Boasting 17K+ members at the time of writing, this group is growing fast and is the best way to connect with other digital nomads and make new like-minded friends. The group organizes recurring running, networking, and board game events. The event spots tend to exceed 100 participants per event, but don’t be disappointed if you end up on a waiting list. You can still show up to the event and be admitted!
www.meetup.com
Polylogue’s Lightning Talks
If there were a category for the most thought-provoking event host, Polylogue would win. The idea behind this group is simple yet powerful: whoever shows up can give a 5 min talk about any topic of their choice. The host will provide a projector, a microphone, and snacks. The reason why I love this event so much is that it forces you in a way to learn something new that you would otherwise not look into. Topics range from highly technical concepts to funny talks about delivering packages to the most secluded places in the world to relationship advice. Whatever the case may be, it’s always fun, and it’s a great way to meet people who are passionate about what they do in life. Additionally, if you’re looking for a new coworking space, attending Lightning Talks may help you decide, as the events are hosted across various coworks.
www.meetup.com
Lisbon Supper Club
I first encountered this concept in Lisbon and immediately fell in love with it. This is how it works: you sign up for a themed supper (for example, a “British Roast” or “Truffle Lovers”), pay around 25 euros, and then attend the supper with up to 20 people who also signed up. The interesting twist is that the supper takes place in the dining room inside the chef’s apartment which creates an incredible atmosphere encouraging all the strangers to get to know one another by the end of the feast. The food is delicious, the ambiance is magical, and the new friendships last!
www.meetup.com
Passport Comedy
I’m not going to lie, I had low expectations for this group before going to their first event. And then — haha! Little did I know how excellent these events would turn out to be. Passport Comedy has a solid lineup of comedians who will guarantee you an evening filled with tears of laughter. I laughed there more than at the Comedy Cellar in NYC. Grab your spot before these comedians begin doing Netflix Stand-Up Comedy Specials — it’s worth it!
www.meetup.com
Storytelling Lisboa
The concept of this group is quite fascinating. Each event has a specific theme, such as “Chaos,” “Breaks,” or “Landlords,” and one thing in common — participants can volunteer to spend 10 min telling their story to an audience of 200+ people. Anyone can volunteer to tell a story, but there can be no more than ten speakers per event. The stories range from sad to funny, and the events are hosted in English or Portuguese. I was impressed by how well-structured, emotional, and thought-provoking these stories are. It’s an event format that is worth checking out at least once.
www.meetup.com
The Block Lisboa
This article wouldn’t be complete without at least one mention of a crypto-focused group. The Block hosts many crypto, NFT, and developer events. Some of them are more technical and may require prior knowledge, so make sure to read through the event description. I attended an excellent NFT workshop that felt like a whole course on NFTs, met extremely savvy people, and enjoyed great food. Regardless of how familiar you’re with blockchain, I strongly recommend looking through what The Block offers as long as you’re curious about how things work.
www.meetup.com
Two Left Feet
And finally, salsa and bachata! This group guarantees a relaxing evening filled with music and dance moves. As long as the weather’s good, the classes take place outdoors, and the instructor explains each move clearly. While dancing, the participants are asked to switch partners with every new song, so this class is a great way to get better at salsa and bachata and an excellent way to make new friends.
www.meetup.com
That’s it! I strongly recommend checking out these Meetup groups. I realize there are other great groups out there, so if you feel like I missed any of them, please leave a comment so that every reader can benefit from your recommendation. I am seeing more and more groups being added weekly, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this list grows 10x by the end of 2023!

This historic city has delicious seafood, unique local music, and stunning views

I’ve just got back from exploring one of the warmest, most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited: Lisbon
After a week of exploring Portugal’s capital, I’ve come up with some must-dos for making the most out of your visit.
The beautiful gates of old Lisbon (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
The internal transportation system in Lisbon is easy to use: you go to any metro station and from the machines there buy a Viva Viagem card for 50 cents. You then charge the card as much as you want, in increments of 3, 5, and 10 euros.
Once you’ve charged your card, you can select what kind of ticket you want to use it for. You can “zap” in and out of the metro and some buses by touching the card over a scanner at the beginning and end of each journey. This will automatically deduct the cost of your trip from your card’s total.
Alternatively, before you begin your day’s travel you can choose to buy a day pass the ticket on the card for 6 euros, which may work out cheaper.
Pro tip: Get two cards — one for zapping, and one to use if you needed a day pass.
Lisbon is famous for its seafood and for its pastries. There is a lot to try, but if I had to recommend just two must-eats, they would be Bacalhau (salted cod) and Pastel de nata (custard tartlets).
Pastel de nata (amazing Portuguese pastry made from custard), is something you can’t miss when visiting Lisbon
Pastel de nata is one of the most common and well-known Portuguese pastries, and every visitor to Lisbon should try them. Pasteis de Belem makes a great version, by far the best I tried. They were so delicious I managed 12 in one day!
The Bacalhau meanwhile is a very popular ingredient in Portuguese cooking. It’s delicious and quite different from anything you will have tried elsewhere. And don’t skimp on the other kinds of seafood, which is such a key part of Portuguese cuisine — try the grilled salmon, for example.
Pro tip: Go to Casa Portuguesa do Pastel de Bacalhau in the famous Rua Augusta and try a special twist on Bacalhau. This place mixes the traditional flavors in a cod cake filled with Serra da Estrela cheese — a match made in heaven!
Lisbon has its own genre of music, Fado, which is like blues with a touch of folk, and more sadness. If you look online you will find a lot of “Fado houses” recommended by various travel guides to Lisbon, but these are all quite pricey, touristy places.
If you want an authentic experience, just go to Alfama district around 9 to 10 pm, wander through the streets, and check out the small local bars. You will often find places that host non-famous but beautiful Fado singers. Get a drink or a light dinner and enjoy an authentic Portuguese night — one of the best experiences I had in Lisbon.
If you open any Lisbon travel guide, you’ll always find this tip: ride tram №28. The reason is that this tram’s route passes through very interesting, scenic districts of Lisbon, including Baixa, Graça, Alfama, and Estrela.
And the tram itself is old and historical and looks beautiful to ride. But this has become a very touristic attraction and it’s literally full of pickpockets.
Tram 12 because the famous Tram 28 is a tourist trap. (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
So be smart and instead ride tram №12, just beside it. It goes to most of the same places and will provide you with a better experience.
Pro tip: Don’t take the full trip; ride the tram until you arrive at Se Cathedral and hop off. You are now on the top of the hill in the Alfama district. The cathedral is worth seeing and a couple of steps beside it is Santa Luiza Miradouro, a perfect place to watch the sunset, after which you can head to the city center on foot — a beautiful and easy walk.
The view from Santa Luiza Miradouro, one of many beautiful viewpoints on top of the hills in Lisbon (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Lisbon is spread over seven hills. The tops of these hills provide a wonderful opportunity to view the city. These panoramic viewpoints are called miradoras in Portuguese and there are many of them. It’s a free way to view the city’s beauty. Watch a sunset or a sunrise from a miradouro and I promise you it will be something you will never forget.
Above I mentioned the Santa Luiza Miradouro (a personal favorite). But you can also try the Praça Alegria Miradouro (reached from Praça dos Restauradores by the traditional Funicular Gloria), which provides views over Baixa, leading towards the Rio Tejo.
Castelo de Sao Jorge Miradouro is also nice, although don’t bother with the Castle Sao Jorge next door — it’s a waste of time. But this miradouro is on top of the highest hill in Lisbon, so the view is beautiful.
Shopping is a real pleasure here at Centro Colombo, the most famous shopping mall in Lisbon (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Lisbon is a very good clothes shopping destination in Europe, with seriously good prices!
The best place for a shopping spree is Columbus mall; I got a beautiful coat and a pair of jeans for 33 euros this December (650 EGP!).
Pro tip: One word: PRIMARK
There are a lot of amazing day trips that you can do from Lisbon, taking a train from Rossio train station (which is a beautiful thing to see even if you are not traveling!). But if you will do just one, then without a doubt it should be the beautiful city of Sintra.
The beautiful Sintra, a close-by city and a recommended day trip from Lisbon (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Sintra is a historic city over the hills, full of old beautiful palaces and a grand Moorish castle that is worth seeing. The city’s central streets are made of cobblestones and the whole architectural style is colorful and beautiful.
Pro tip: when you arrive by train, exit on the right and wait for the tourist public bus 434 (5 euros); it will take you on a one-way circular ride around the three most important landmarks of Sintra (the town, the Moorish castle on the hill, and the Pena Palace). You can ride and hop on/off any bus until you make a full circle back to the train station. The castle is highly recommended!

This story is about how a one encounter can change everything and how Lisbon can tell you everything if you can listen
Recently we were walking around the city with my friend and he asked me,
— Does the city respond to you? It got me thinking.
If you think of a city as a separate civilization, any city responds to me. Perhaps because I am a historian and I love life, comfortable shoes, walking at least 10 thousand steps a day and have endless curiosity. For me, a city is about life. Some look at a city as a geographical object, others as an investment, a source of income, beauty, history or just a backdrop. I look at the city as a separate civilization. On the other hand, there is a city and there is a village. In the village, life is organized differently. In the village, in my opinion, not much happens. All life is concentrated in the city — championships, concerts, forums, summits, museums, galleries, meetings, marches, etc. Open any news and all the news is about city life. The city is about life. And who is interested in other people’s life? A person is either not interested in it, or he looks at it from the outside, half-heartedly. He’s busy with his own life. For example, can you describe the street where you go to work every day and tell another person about it in such a way that he wants to live on this street? Can you convey your interest in life to another person? Apparently, when we say that this city responds or doesn’t respond to me, we don’t mean the facades of the houses. We’re talking about how the life of the city coincides with our own idea of life. Or it doesn’t. And then it seems like a foreign city.
Cities like people.
First encounter with Lisbon
It wasn’t love at first sight. But it was love. For Lisbon or for Bruno or for Lisbon through love for Bruno. It doesn’t matter anymore. It’s love. I think of Bruno so often that I sometimes think I made him up. Maybe I did. No there really is a guy named Bruno, who showed up at a moment when I felt like there was no way we matched up with Lisbon. He showed up and opened my eyes to this city. No, he wasn’t my city guide, but he looked and kissed me in a way that made me want to live in this city. No, Bruno and I aren’t a couple, he’s still in my memories, and what’s more, I don’t think he even realizes the Important role he played in my life. But my story with Lisbon will always begin with that encounter.
Lisbon responded to me
The day after meeting Bruno, I went for a walk with a completely different mood and found myself in Rossio Square. I took a 360 degree look around and realized that from this point I could see all of Portugal’s history.
Did you know that you can see the history of the country by standing in this very square and you don’t even have to move anywhere? Don’t believe me? Now you will 😊
Medieval Ages
Look up the hill to the east to see St. George’s Castle, one of the oldest buildings in Lisbon. This is where Portugal’s history as a kingdom begins. Having survived the Romans and Visigoths, the Iberian Peninsula was subjected to a new invasion. In 711 Muslims came to its territory — they were called Moors. The beginning of Portugal’s own independent history is associated with the name of Afonso I Henriques, nicknamed the Conqueror. Personality has significance in history. Thanks to Afonso I the territory of the country increased many times. But the most valuable trophy of Afonso I was undoubtedly Lisbon, which after cruel battles in 1147 became part of Portugal and turned into one of the largest centers of the country, and in 1255 the capital from Coimbra was moved to Lisbon.
Not far from Rossio Square there is Martin Muniz Square, who fought bravely during the siege of Lisbon, he alone attacked the gates of the fortress and defended them without letting them close, sacrificing his life. Thanks to Martin Muniz’s feat, the attacking Christian soldiers were able to approach the open gate and capture the fortress.
It is on this square that the famous 28th tram stops, which will take you to St. George’s Castle. Of course, you can also climb the hill on foot and get confused in the maze of streets of Alfama. It is from here that the city began to grow, descending down the hill to the banks of the Tagus River.
If you turn to the west, you will see the Gothic arches of the ruins of the Karmu Monastery. It was once one of the largest churches in the city. The history of the monastery began in 1385, when before the decisive battle of Aljubarrota, King João I of Avis and his magnificent commander-in-chief of the Portuguese army, 25-year-old Nuno Alvares Pereira, made a vow: in the event of victory over the Castilians, each would build a monastery in honor of Our Lady. To commemorate the victory and in fulfillment of the vow made before the battle, João I founded the monastery of Batalha, and Nuno Alvares Pereira in 1389 founded a monastery of the Carmelite order in Lisbon, known as the “Church of Carmo”. Where he later donated all his considerable fortune, and then took monastic tonsure. Pious Nuno lived in the monastery until the end of his days. The hero of the battle Nuno Alvares Pereira deservedly got his place on the arch in the main square Praça do Comércio.
The Carmelite Monastery was to become one of the most beautiful monuments of the National Gothic, but a tragic fate awaited it. On November 1, 1755, the vaults of the church could not withstand the strong earth tremors and collapsed, burying the townspeople who came to mass under them and losing forever the tomb of Connetabile Nuno, whom the Vatican canonized recently in 2009. The Battle of Aljubarrota, in which Portuguese troops defeated the Castilian army, laid the foundations for the Age of Discovery.
The Age of the Great Discovery was a golden age for Portugal, the XV-XVI centuries
Take a look at the square beneath your feet: the wave-shaped mosaic is no accident. It is a symbol of the ocean, of the sea voyages that made Portugal a great empire. Portugal opened the world to the world and discovered itself. The age of the Great Discovery was a golden age for Portugal, the XV-XVI centuries were a time of unprecedented Portuguese greatness, it was a wonderful time of selfless and courageous navigators heroes.
Breathe in the air. Can you smell it?
The most incredible smell I’ve ever smelled is the smell of jacaranda. Lisbon’s lilac tree, Jacaranda mimosifolia, is truly worthy of the royal court. Jacaranda came from Brazil, bringing with it the scent of honey, grapes and the Atlantic Ocean. Brazil was a colony of Portugal, and Rio de Janeiro even served as the capital of the empire for 13 years, because of the invasion of Napoleon’s army under the command of General Junot the royal house had to move to Brazil in 1807. It is a unique fact in history that the capital of an empire becomes its overseas colony.
In fact, the official name of the square is Pedro IV Square. In the center of the square you can see a monument to the King of Portugal and the first emperor of Brazil.
Rossio Square now looks smart and peaceful. And once the fires of the Inquisition were burning here, heretics and witches were burned on the place of today’s national theater of Queen Mary stood the palace of the Inquisition and people always gathered to watch this spectacle. The first autodafa took place here in 1540.
Slowly, the former greatness of the Portuguese Empire fades away and in 1580. Portgugal fell under Spanish rule for 60 years. In 1640 there is a rebellion in Lisbon, as a result of which the independence of Portugal was restored. And if we walk a little from Rossio Square past the magnificent train station, we will see the Monumento dos Restauradores.
In 1755 Lisbon was destroyed by a terrible earthquake.
Take a look around — this is Lisbon Pombal. Lisbon rebuilt after the earthquake. a great city reborn after a great catastrophe. At least, that was the original intention of Marquis Sebastião José Pombalho, who was appointed by King José I to lead the rebuilding of Lisbon after the devastating earthquake of 1755 and who created the so-called Pombaline style. One of the most characteristic features of the Pombalino style is its desire for order and will to live, which can be traced back to people’s desire to protect themselves from the destructive elements. If in Alfama it is very easy to get lost in its chaotic winding streets, then in the lower new Lisbon it is impossible to do so — the city is built on a plan, clearly on a line. The task before the architects was difficult — it was necessary not only to rebuild a part of the country, but also to make the buildings stronger and more resistant to seismic activity. Pombalino style is very visible on the streets of the city — strict rectangular shapes of buildings, the exterior of buildings is simple, standard and laconic.
Breathe in again. What do you smell this time?
It’s the smell of coffee and the roaring 1920s. I was sitting in Café Nicola, where the bohemians of Lisbon drank coffee. Did you know that Portugal is a coffee fanatic country. According to the Potrugal Coffee Association (Associação Industrial e Comercial do Café https://aicc.pt/) 80% of Portuguese people can’t imagine their lives without coffee, while the rest don’t drink it. Remember the phrase: “Um café e um pastel de nata, por favor” and you won’t be lost. A vida só começa depois de um café — life begins only after coffee. I don’t know who this phrase belongs to, but I’m sure he was Portuguese. By the way, definitely those 20% are lying.
The 20th century is a turbulent time.
As I stood in Rossio Square I remembered that it was here in 1974 that thousands of people gathered to celebrate the fall of the dictatorship. On April 25, 1974, a bloodless military revolution took place in Portugal. Soldiers, tired of colonial wars and censorship, overthrew the authoritarian regime. In the streets, women and children came up to them, put carnations in the barrels of their rifles — and they did not shoot. Red carnations became a symbol of freedom and in Portugal you look at them in a special way. This event has become a symbol of hope for all of Europe.
Here in Lisbon, in Rossio Square, on Avenida da Liberdade, at the walls of Carmo, the dreams of freedom have become a reality. And I want to remember that revolutions are not always accompanied by weapons. Sometimes it’s just flowers and music. And that’s the lesson of Lisbon.
And that’s not all that Rossio Square has to tell us.
The city responded to me. It was in this city that I first experienced how deeply a place can speak if you know how to listen to it. Here, in Rossio Square, another Portugal opened up before me.
If you have walked around Rossio Square too, tell what you felt. Maybe this place opened up an unexpected side of Portugal for you?
I want to work in Lisbon as a tour guide. I want to tell the guests of the city about the history of the country, which has given the world so many wonderful discoveries and not only geographical discoveries and many lessons.
That’s my dream.And dreams are supposed to come true.

Posted: 6/26/2003 | June 23rd, 2023
Lisbon is one of my favorite cities in the world. It’s home to impressive museums, historic buildings, picturesque plazas, chilled-out cafes, and a lively mix of clubs and candlelit music venues where people go to listen to traditional fado music. I fell in love with the city as soon as I arrived — and it was even better the second time!
Today, Lisbon is one of the most popular cities on the continent. From cruisers to digital nomads, everyone loves this sunny city. I’ve visited a few times over the years and always look forward to going back. The warm weather, inviting colors, and laid-back vibe really make people feel welcome.
The best way to see the city, though (especially if it’s your first time) is to take a walking tour. It’s the first thing I do when I visit a new city as it’s the best way to connect with a local guide, get insider info, and see the main sights.
These days, there are a ton of walking tours available to ensure you make the most of your visit. Here’s a list of my favorites — from free tours to food tours to pub crawls — to help you sort through it all so you just end up with the best!
Best Overall Tour
Learn More
I’ve taken Walks tours all over Europe and it is, by far, my favorite tour company. They always manage to go above and beyond with tours that are both fun and educational.
In Lisbon, they offer a few tours (including food tours) but for a good primer on the city I recommend their Lisbon in a Day tour. It includes a river cruise, early access to Jeronimos Monastery, and lunch. It lasts a full day too!
Best Free Tour
Learn More
This informative three-hour free tour takes you through five of Lisbon’s most popular neighborhoods — Graça, Alfama, Baixa, Chiado, and Bairro Alto — offering up an entertaining and enlightening dose of history and culture along the way.
The tours also focus on a more local side of Lisbon. If you’re on a budget and want an introduction to the city, this is the tour for you. Just remember to tip the guide!
Here are a few more walking tour options to help you make the most of your time in Lisbon:
Devour started in Spain and quickly began doing tours in Lisbon. They offer a food and fado tour, mixing two cultural highlights of Lisbon on one tour. I personally like the Tastes & Traditions food tour they do: you stop at seven small businesses in Lisbon, eating up to nine samples and sipping three different types of beverages. Devour is one of the best food tour companies in Europe and their Lisbon tours are no exception.
Tours start at 95 EUR.
Book here!
This tour company offers a whole range of tours but their Best of Lisbon introductory tour is perfect for both first-time Lisbon visitors and budget travelers. The three-hour tour starts at 9:30am and takes you through some of the city’s main neighborhoods, making a stop for wine and a bite of the famous pastry, pastel de nata (an egg custard tart). The group tours max out at 14 people.
Tours start at 18 EUR.
Book here!
Street art has taken over the world’s big cities, including Lisbon. On this three-hour tour, you’ll see some of the best works in the city and learn about the social and political motives behind them. Tours are led by a local street artist too, so you’ll really get an insider’s look at the scene and visit murals most other tours skip.
Tours start at 35 EUR.
Book here!
Pancho does tours all over the Iberian Peninsula, using local guides and crafting itineraries that focus on street art, tapas and wine, and day trips to places like Sintra. Personally, I like their fado music tour. During the 2.5-hour tour, you’ll learn everything there is about this melancholic music that’s endemic to Portugal. You’ll get a front-row seat at a fado show in the center of Lisbon at the end.
Tours start at around 40 EUR.
Book here!
Overtourism is a problem in many cities, particularly in Europe, with crowds of people ping-ponging from one attraction to the next. Hence, the idea behind We Hate Tourism Tours: the 3.5-hour walking tour takes you to some way off-the-radar neighborhoods to show you how the people of Lisbon really live. There are only about six people per tour, which keeps things intimate. It also means you should book in advance as tours sell out fast. I love how they are getting people out of the main touristy areas and showing you a real look at Lisbon life. I can’t recommend this tour enough.
Tours start at 40 EUR.
Book here!
Lisbon has a very lively nightlife these days and, if you’re looking for a way to see it while also meeting other travelers, the classic pub crawl is a good way to go. This tour takes you to three spots, with a free shot at the first and the third stop. Plus, there’s a one-hour period of all-you-can-drink cider or sangria. It’s a great option for solo travelers looking to meet other people. It’s not a real “local” thing but it’s fun!
Tours start at 20 EUR.
Book here!
***
Lisbon has walking tours for just about every interest and budget, which is one of the many reasons I love the city. Whenever I visit, I always take a tour or two because the city just has so much to see and do, and the local guides always add a ton of value to my trip. These tours allow you to get an inside perspective on life here and ask locals questions on where to go, what to do, and how to act. Be sure to take at least one of these tours while you are in the city.
My detailed, 200+ page guidebook is made for budget travelers like you! It gets straight to the practical information you need to save money while backpacking around Europe. You’ll find suggested itineraries, budgets, ways to save money, on and off the beaten path things to see and do, non-touristy restaurants, markets, and bars, and more! Click here to learn more and get started!
Book Your Flight Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. They are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. Two of my favorite places to stay are:
If you’re looking for more places to stay, here is a complete list of my favorite hostels in Lisbon.
Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:

Stories from Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking lands and cultures

Recently I received a call from an Asian friend, who also happens to be a former colleague. He was embarking on a maiden trip to Lisbon, and wanted me to help him formulate a list of things to do.
I’ve been to Portugal’s capital city so many times that I have got bored with it. In fact, these days when I plan a trip to the Iberian nation, I prefer to skip the capital altogether.
Having said that, even though a typically touristy exercise, it was nonetheless my friend’s first trip to Lisbon. As such, I wanted to help him in every way I could, hoping to contribute as much information as was possible. In any case, his list of questions was palpably a long one.
Frankly speaking, Portugal’s capital has quite a few iconic monuments and tourist attractions. On the contrary, a lot of options mean someone who is visiting the city for the first time would struggle to make decisions.
It was a matter of time before his itinerary became increasingly elaborate. Based on suggestions, including that of yours truly, he had included Arco da Rua Augusta (Rua Augusta Arch), Avenida da Liberdade (Avenue of Liberty), Baixa Pombalina (Downtown), Mosteiro dos Jerónimos (the Jerónimos Monastery or…

Lisbon,https://medium.com/explore-everyday/tagged/lisbon,"So much to say about these past days in Lisbon, Portugal. I can’t really claim to have discovered this city properly or put enough effort into understanding the Portuguese culture and for this I am placing the blame squarely on the city’s ability to party.
Dear You:
Home is such a faraway place now — across the ocean and 13 hours back, with your body strapped in place and the monitor throwing light onto your lap. You cannot sleep. Blue butterflies trail down Cinderella’s ball gown, and Taylor Swift…
We spent two nights in Lisbon as part of our 5 night trip to Portugal for the March Easter weekend. Getting from Sintra to Lisbon was pretty easy although we did have some confusion when getting a ticket from the machine — it’s probably better to head into the main train station and buy a ticket from there.
When people talk about Chapitô, the first image that usually comes to their mind is the stunning view of Lisbon they get from the terrasse of the restaurant, Chapitô à Mesa. But the project of Chapitô goes beyond the simple borders of its restaurant: Chapitô reunites…
Workdays can be pretty exhausting at times and Friday can seem far away. Fortunately, someone came…
Welcome to the Incomplete Guide to Lisbon’s Food Culture. Yes, it’s still work…"

I love the bustle of Lisbon: the up-and-down streets, the beauty of the multicolored azulejos façades on the buildings, the decorated cobblestone streets and sidewalks, and even the grittiness of the poorer neighbourhoods. But sometimes you want a break, a place without busy-ness, without touristy-ness. A place where you can feel calm and reflective for few hours. I discovered such a place in Estrela Park, a few blocks from the gleaming and grand Portuguese Parliament Buildings, and just opposite the Basilica da Estrela.
In contrast to these grand and gleaming buildings, Estrela Park feels intimate and a bit wild. Its main features are the exotic plants and trees from around the world that grow tall and lush within its gates. The park was designed in 1842 as a place for the working classes of Lisbon to relax and forget the toil and the stress of city living. Ironically, funding for construction dried up due to political instability, and the park was not completed until thirty years later. This was a tumultuous time for Portugal, as the nation veered precariously and at times violently between monarchists and republicans.
The tranquil green spaces are punctuated by several beautiful stone statues. It occurred to me that this juxtaposition between art and nature, white and green, would be worth a photo essay, showing the statues at a distance, half-hidden by the foliage, and then up close, where the depth of their expressiveness is unconcealed. But then, as I learned the stories behind these statues they revealed themselves to be much more than decorative. I’m presenting them in the order I came across them as I explored the park (and with gratitude to this Wordpress article, which helped me fill in the blanks about their origins):
The King’s Daughter, Guardian of the Ducks
She stands amid the rushes in the center of a pond, carrying a bundle of straw or something; a gaggle of stone ducks flocks around her feet. Up close, the naturalistic Art Nouveau style of the sculpture shows her in motion, walking along, yet looking down with care and affection at the ducks she guards. But wait: why would anyone guard ducks?
I discovered online that the statue was inspired by the Norwegian fairy tale of the same name, which I had never before heard of. The ducks, it turns out, are actually the 12 brothers of the princess. They had been enchanted by an evil witch. The princess risked her own life to break the spell, which could only be done by weaving each brother a shirt from thistledown (that’s what she carries in her arms). The down had to be harvested by moonlight in the moor of the trolls. It’s a harrowing tale of courage and deception, well worth reading.
Statue of João de Deus
João de Deus was a famous Portuguese poet, educator and politician of the 19th century, known for his personal rigor and political independence — he never joined a political party. I first spied him behind the wrought-iron fence of the bandstand, beneath a flowering jacaranda tree. I was struck by the upright posture of this diminutive man, whose large head makes his body seem quite short. He seems both humble and strangely dignified. The school just next to the park bears his name.
Wikipedia says this about him: Next to Camões and perhaps Almeida Garrett, no Portuguese poet has been more widely read, more profoundly admired than João de Deus; yet no poet in any country has been more indifferent to public opinion and more deliberately careless of personal fame…
Oh my! He sounds like a man with the heart of a flanêur!
The Digger
This statue of a farmer tilling the soil with a hoe was erected in 1913 — the first statue added to the garden after the monarchy was abolished and Portugal became a republic in 1910. Framed behind a spreading banyan tree, the sculpture seems a fitting public expression to mark the political transition. Notice how clearly the man’s rough clothing and strong arms are depicted.
But that look in his eyes — it’s not that of a victorious peasant embracing his nation’s freedom, is it? To me, he is looking up anxiously, almost fearfully. Perhaps he symbolizes the entire nation, still working hard just to survive, gazing towards an uncertain future of the 20th Century. Would the eyes of a similar statue created in Portugal in 2022 look much different?
The Awakening, or Laziness
This 1915 statue of a naked young woman arising in the morning is said to be the most popular in the park. It’s easy to see why. From a distance, under an umbrella tree, her white figure is eye-catchingly sensuous.
Up close, though, it is the expression on her face that makes her so utterly beguiling — that satisfied, languorous smile, those half-opened eyes! Though one of her arms is missing, the other is clearly in the middle of a stretch. I love the two very different words the woman supposedly embodies: Awakening and Laziness. Is she rising to meet the day, awakening to the possibilities and hopes of her future — much as the young republic was awakening? Or has she already risen too late to do anything productive with her youthful energy? It’s hard not to think about her fellow statue, the Digger, not 50 meters away, who has been toiling away, probably since dawn.
Statue of Antero de Quental
Antero de Quental was a 19th Century realist poet and political philosopher, but his statue is the last edition to the park. It was installed in this private grove of ivy-covered trees in 1951. It makes me laugh to see a “realist” poet dressed in the robes of an ancient Roman! I hope he has a good sense of humor in whatever immortal realm of the poets he resides.
As a young poet, de Quental declared the role of poets, in an era of great transformation, was to be messengers of the day’s great ideological questions. He emerged as a socialist, advocate of the proletariat, and eventually an anarchist. To me it’s surprising his defiant-seeming statue was installed in the midst of Portugal’s repressive Salazar dictatorship.
Wikipedia has this to say about the great poet, and the sad ending of his life: Throughout his life, de Quental oscillated between pessimism and depression; afflicted with what might have been bipolar disorder…he committed suicide by two gunshots to the stomach while seated on a bench in a local garden park. He died approximately an hour later. “Of all things, the worst is having been born,” he wrote in a poem.
Allegory (Man with a Dog)
This final statue I encountered reclines at the edge of another little lake in the park, and has an “unknown provenance.” Seen below, shrouded behind palm trees, it features a man in a robe with wild curly hair and a long beard that appears blown back as he leans slightly into an invisible strong wind. His large, powerful hands hold protectively onto his little dog. Its lips form a wide “O” because its mouth is also the spout of a fountain.
There is something loveable about this sculpture. I suppose it is the forcefulness of the man juxtaposed with the gentle way he holds his companion. It made me smile and think of all the old men and women I’ve seen in Lisbon, even in Estrela Park, out walking their little dogs.
The future might be wild and uncertain, but we can do the best we can to take care of the ones we love, whether dogs or ducks or a whole nation, even a continent, once again in the midst of turbulent times and perhaps a great transformation.

"Lisbon: The Most Over-Hyped, Over-Priced “Hidden Gem” in Europe",https://medium.com/@Lidinwise/lisbon-the-most-over-hyped-over-priced-hidden-gem-in-europe-07885eff7ce5,"Sign up

Ah, Lisbon. The “it” destination of every travel influencer who’s already exhausted Paris, Rome, and Barcelona. You know, that hidden gem where everyone and their grandmother is flocking to for its authentic charm? Yeah, that place.
Let me paint you a picture: sun-drenched streets, vibrant azulejos, and Fado music echoing from every corner. It all sounds like a dream, right? Until you’re elbow-to-elbow with a herd of selfie-stick-wielding tourists, paying €15 for a pastel de nata while being told it’s a steal. Lisbon is that friend who showed up late to the party, acts like they invented the party, and then charges you an entry fee to stay.
Remember when people said Lisbon was Europe’s best-kept secret, a cheap alternative to all those other overpriced cities? Ah yes, those were the days… like three years ago. Fast forward to today, and you’re casually dropping €200 a night for an Airbnb with a rustic view of the neighbor’s laundry hanging out to dry. Authentic, right? At least the Tuk-Tuksare cheap. Oh wait, no they’re not — get ready to sell a kidney for a 10-minute ride that smells like exhaust fumes and regret.
Oh, and about those locals everyone raves about meeting — good luck finding any. Lisbon is now a foreigner’s paradise, with expats and digital nomads who’ve all set up camp. You won’t meet many born-and-bred Lisboetas because they’ve been priced out of their own city and forced to the suburbs. It’s basically Lisbon: The International Edition. But sure, tell your friends you really connected with the local culture while chatting with other tourists over overpriced sangria.
What could make this urban utopia even better? How about a healthy dose of soul-crushing traffic. Lisbon has turned into a slow-moving parking lot. It’s ironic because for a city with hills so steep they should come with a life insurance policy, you’d think driving would be a breeze. Nope. It’s gridlock central, with honking horns, frustrated drivers, and narrow streets that could fit maybe one-and-a-half cars from the 1980s. So be prepared to sit back, relax, and enjoy the sounds of motorbikes revving while you take in the sights and smells of the city.
Speaking of smells…
If you’re looking for that special olfactory experience, Lisbon’s got you covered. Nothing says European sophisticationquite like walking down a street and being hit with the sweet perfume of sewage mixed with leftover sardines and an occasional whiff of diesel fumes. Add in the occasional garbage strike, and you’ve got a delightful sensory overload that really enhances the ambiance. Ah, the authenticity.
“Lisbon has the best seafood in the world!” they say, and sure, it’s great. If by “great” you mean paying €30 for a plate of sardines served with a side of Instagrammable lighting. Maybe you can hunt for one of those hidden, local tasquinhas, but here’s the reality: the moment you find one, congratulations! So has the rest of the internet. Prepare to pay tourist prices for what used to be a grandma’s Sunday lunch.
And speaking of pastel de nata (because everyone has to mention it, right?), after you’ve waited 45 minutes in line for the world’s best custard tart at Pastéis de Belém, you’ll realize something groundbreaking: it’s a tart. A good tart, but in the end, it’s 3 bites of egg custard. Revolutionary.
Love walking? Great, because you’ll be doing a lot of it. Lisbon is famous for its seven hills, which should really come with a fitness warning. Your calves will either be rock solid after day one or you’ll be crawling up to the nearest overpriced cafe to gasp for air and reconsider your life choices. Who needs a gym when you’ve got uneven cobblestone streets and inclines that rival the Tour de France?
Oh, and don’t think about wearing anything stylish. Those charming stone sidewalks will have you slipping and sliding into oblivion. Practical shoes or death — your call.
Lisbon is the land of boutique hotels and chic rooftop bars now. Need a cocktail with a view? You’re in luck — if you’ve got €15 to spare for something served in a mason jar with an edible flower garnish. Nothing screams “authentic Portuguese culture” quite like a trendy rooftop overlooking the real Lisbon down below, where locals used to afford rent.
Speaking of rent, just try talking to someone who’s lived in Lisbon for more than five years. They’ll tell you about the days when you could get a two-bedroom apartment for the price of a plate of Bacalhau à Brás. Now? Good luck finding anything that’s not being Airbnb-ed by some guy named Chad who’s “living his best life” while making a killing off your holiday budget.
Fado music is the soul of Lisbon, a haunting, melancholic soundtrack to the city’s history. That is, until you realize you’re paying €50 for a dinner-and-Fado experience where the servers sing in between handing you a glass of overpriced house wine. It’s like dinner theater but with extra saudade and a hefty bill.
If you love being part of a crowd of people who are all convinced they’ve discovered something new and edgy, Lisbon is for you. Sure, it’s beautiful, but so is that postcard of the Eiffel Tower you could’ve bought instead of spending €500 on a long weekend here. Between the hills, the prices, the awful traffic, the expat invasion, and the stench, Lisbon is Europe’s most over-hyped, over-exposed city. But hey, at least you’ll get a great Instagram post out of it. #LisbonGoals #LivingTheDream #SendHelp

Tried & tested recommendations from a diehard Lisbon lover.
Ah, Lisbon. With 4.5 million visitors per year, it’s one of the world’s leading tourist destinations—and a city that, for the past winter, I’ve been lucky to call home. Given that there are too many attractions worth seeing in this historic seaside capital, it was tough to pick favorites. But if you ever get a chance to explore, here are a few places you definitely shouldn’t miss.

Hello readers!
I’ve always dreamt of being the traveler who writes her blog from a cozy coffee shop in the visiting town. That dream comes true as I bring you this post live from Lisbon, Portugal.
Sid and I couldn’t be happier since we touched down in Portugal. Visiting this vibrant country has been a long-standing wish, and we’re thrilled to be here finally. We are spending ten days exploring two incredible destinations: the vibrant capital city of Lisbon and the stunning volcanic island of Sao Miguel in the Azores.
In this blog post, I will share my experience in Lisbon.
I had doubts when Sid insisted on coming to Lisbon instead of Porto or Faro, as in my research, most travel blogs raved about these two as more popular and cultural cities to visit. But oh boy, how Lisbon grew on me.
I mean it is difficult not to fall in love with Lisbon. In addition to its energy, charm, and laid-back vibe, the city has so much to offer:
What more can a girl want? Well, Lisbon had a secret surprise for me.
By lucky happenstance, we visited Lisbon in the week of St Anthony’s Day, the biggest festival of the year for the city. This catapulted our experience 10x. Not only did we get to enjoy the festivities of June 12, but also we got to see the city in its full charm, bustling with street parties, food stalls, on-the-go cocktails, & colorful decorations throughout the five days.
The festival was undoubtedly a highlight, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have experienced such cultural immersion. Here are some special moments from our time joining the local festivities:
If you can, I will highly recommend planning your trip to the capital city of Portugal in June. But no sweat if you are unable to. Lisbon is a family-friendly and an all-year destination, so visit whenever you visit, you will have a great time.
Let me share more about what else made our Lisbon experience unforgettable.
Belem was our first stop in Lisbon. It’s full of attractions, so we purchased a 24-hour Lisboa card to avoid having to buy individual tickets at each site. This also helped us avoid queues which is a life savior as this location is frequented by many tourists. Almost everywhere there was a 30–45-minute queue to get tickets, so I will highly recommend buying yours in advance!
We started with the Belem Tower. It had beautiful stone architecture and was very picturesque thanks to being right by the water.
Besides that though, there wasn't much to do inside despite the hype. So if you are pressed for time, instead of waiting in line to go up the tower, I will recommend walking along the water to the Monument of the Discoveries, I enjoyed this walk much more than exploring Belem Tower from inside.
The Monument of Discoveries was a captivating work of art. It showcases 33 significant figures who played pivotal roles in Portugal’s overseas expansion. On this trip, I was fascinated to discover how much the Portuguese pride their international conquests in South America and Asia.
What truly captivated me about this monument were the intricate carvings of these figures. As someone who dabbles in pottery and finds it challenging to carve even in the forgiving medium of clay, I can only imagine the skill and precision required to achieve such detailed work in stone.
Speaking of carving, the real treasure was the Jerónimos Monastery — our next stop! While I was standing in the line to go in, I had many moments when I wanted to ditch it and move on to the next site as even Lisboa card didn't allow us to skip-the-queue here. But THANK GOD I did not.
The architecture inside the Monastery is breathtaking. I was constantly reaching for my phone, and even though the lighting was challenging, we managed a few great clicks.
There was also a church adjacent to the monastery, which was equally beautiful. I had a little deja vu of history class when I crossed Vasco Dd Gamma’s tomb, remembering reading about him as the man who found the sea route from Europe to India, ultimately leading to the Portuguese colonizing the Indian state of Goa.
Belem also has the iconic Pastéis de Belém, a popular bakery where the iconic custard tarts of Portugal are believed to have originated. It was so conveniently located next to the monastery, that we weren't even surprised that there was a long wait to get a table. It didn't matter as the weather was pleasant, we just grabbed our bites and enjoyed them in the nearby park — in true London fashion! 😉
After Belem, we returned to the city center. We decided to hike up to the Castle Sao Jorge via Alfama.
Alfama is Lisbon’s oldest and most enchanting neighborhood. And wandering through its narrow, winding streets here is one of my favorite memories from the trip. 😍
Second favorite memory is the pitstop at Portas do Sol. This viewpoint offers a much-needed breather after climbing the steep steps of Alfama. And the panoramic view is breathtaking! Another spot where I couldn't stop reaching for my phone and managed to get a few good clicks despite challenging lighting.
I came back to this multiple times during the trip and it was never enough time to soak in the beauty.
As we made our way to the castle, the views were even more spectacular from up there. The castle’s interior doesn’t hold much as most of it was destroyed in an earthquake, which was never reinstated. Fun fact: under the dictator's rule, this castle’s walls were restored to create a postcard-perfect image of Lisbon, leaving the insides in complete ruins.
I, however, thoroughly enjoyed exploring the interiors too. The battlements, the scenic staircase, peacocks strutting the castle grounds, and remains of the pottery used many years ago, made for a charming evening.
We also watched the sunset from the cozy little restaurant they had inside the castle walls. It was the perfect place to end the day and savor some summer drinks after a long fulfilling day.
Lisbon provides easy accessibility to the neighboring towns such as Sintra and Cascais. Both of which are less than an hour's train ride and cost under 10 euros back and forth.
For Sintra, we took the train from Rossio Station. Trains also run from Oriente station at a higher frequency but we opted for Rossio as that was within walking distance from our apartment and we wanted to get there as soon as possible to beat the crowd (which we couldn’t because yours truly likes her sleep😛).
The town was quite hilly, so while I was taking my time to hike around in my flowy dress, Sid, who grew up in the foothills of the Himalayas aka pahadi ladka, was feeling right at home and leading the way enthusiastically.
And for once, instead of Sid, I was remembering my childhood vacations in the hills — to Shimla and Mussoorie — the famous hill stations in India.
Our first stop was Quinta da Regaleira. This site is a mysterious estate with Gothic architecture, hidden tunnels, and lush gardens. Everything was so beautiful and well-maintained, that one can easily spend hours in this place.
The highlight was undoubtedly the famous Initiation Well, a spiral staircase that descends into the earth.
We enjoyed the experience of going down the stairs and it was also fun to explore the network of underground passages and caves it led to.
Our day was jam-packed as there were two more sites we wanted to see in Sintra. So we decided to have a quick lunch at the café within the estate. The soup at the cafe was one of the best soups I have had — 100% recommended.
We decided to make our way to Moors Cattle — our next destination — via a hike through Villa Sassetti. Now, here are some learnings:
It took us about 45 minutes to the Moorish Castle. Even though I was feeling tired, this site took my breath away. It was an ancient fortress that extended on two sides with long stone-walled towers on each. It was a complete contrast to Quinta da Regaleira but no less breathtaking. I had never seen anything like this before, so I was in awe. And despite my fear of heights, I climbed to the highest point of the castle and was rewarded with stunning views.
Can you tell from my photo that I was getting tired? Well, by the time we reached the iconic Pena Palace — I was in a mood 🥱
Sintra is often referred to as the magical town owing to this palace because it allegedly inspired Walt Disney to create the castle in Disney stories. Sadly, I wasn’t as impressed by the palace as I had hoped. Maybe it was the mix of exhaustion and crowds that turned me off. Because goes without saying that the palace was stunning. The intricate tile work and the rich contrast of deep red and yellow with the green-manicured gardens were truly impressive.
And roaming around the rooms gave an insight into how living in the bygone era of royalty and romance must have felt.
Kudos to Sid for keeping me going and capturing beautiful memories of lifetime despite my exhaustion.
After two days of intense exploring, Sid decided to catch up on work for the remaining days. It was a perfect excuse for me to start the morning slow.
The shot above is from our apartment in Lisbon. We stayed at the Sao Nicolau Townhouse by Ando Living. Ando Living is a collection of lifestyle-serviced apartments in Lisbon, Porto, and Istanbul. The apartment was spacious and beautifully decorated and we were welcomed with complimentary snacks and wine, which was a pleasant surprise and fun to relish on this balcony after a tiring day of city exploring.
We liked staying in the Baixa-Chidao area, it was a little touristy but the vibes and connectivity were excellent.
With easier access to Europe, Sid and I are embracing the concept of slow travel. This means staying longer at places we are visiting to truly soak in the local culture. Sid is splitting his time between exploring and working remotely. I am using the extra days to engage in local activities that otherwise I wouldn’t have the time for.
I was fortunate to try a few of these in Lisbon, and I will recommend these three:
After that, I decided to take a baking class for Pastéis de Nata. I am not a big chef, but I like to learn new skills, and cooking delicacies from different cuisines has always fascinated me. When we decided to move to London, I remember thinking this would be a good opportunity to build this skill. After all:
There are multiple baking classes available, but I decided to do the one with Homecooking Lisbon. It was highly rated and better priced. I think that’s because it was a little out of the touristy areas, but not too far, as I walked to LX Factory from there. I also saw a tram right outside so its pretty well connected.
The baking class turned out to be an incredible experience. Having never baked pastries before, I was nervous. But our instructor was so skilled and walked us through each step patiently. Honestly, I thought the tarts are pretty easy to bake at home, and I will definitely try.
I made a new friend in the class— a sweet girl from Australia with whom I was teamed up. I had a blast baking together and we couldnt stop giggling after she pointed to me that she found our instructor rather charming 🥰
I also met a lovely couple from New Zealand who had been saving for years to make this trip happen and were midway in their three-month-long Europe exploration, having covered South France and Spain before Portugal, and were headed to Greece and Italy after.
There was also this fun family from California. Both parents were proud chemical engineers, much to the embarrassment of their daughter, who had to keep reminding them that “This is a cooking class, not a science class!” 😄
And the best part was that we not only had a plate full of warm custards to try as a group, but was enough for everyone to take home — I was so excited for Sid to try!
2. Free Walking tour
Last but not least, I can’t not talk about the free walking tout I took on my last day in Lisbon. It was a fantastic way to meet a local guide and learn fun facts about the city that I had so thoroughly enjoyed.
Our tour guide was fantastic — she was fun, laid-back, and full of captivating stories about Portugal — good, bad or ugly — she narrated her anecdotes in an endearing way.
Did you know that Lisbon is older than Rome? Yep, it is the second oldest capital city in Europe, right after Athens. Despite being so ancient, it was ruled by numerous powers, including the Romans, Germans, Spanish, Greeks, and even the Moors. The Moors, in particular, left a lasting legacy with their beautiful tiles that adorn the city today.
Did you know the Portuguese are very proud of the overseas expansion? I mean, they did put up the Monument of Discoveries in Belem to celebrate that. I knew the Portuguese had invaded India and Brazil, but I didn’t know they had invaded China as well. In fact, I learned an interesting fun fact that oranges in the Mediterranean used to be bitter and green until the Portuguese found the sweet and reddish oranges in China, which they brought back to Europe for trade. They were such a hit that countries started naming the fruit after Portugal — Romania’s ‘portocale,’ Bulgaria and Turkey’s ‘portakal,’ and Greece’s ‘portokali’ all mean orange.
Our tour guide also shared about the time when Portugal crowned a bastard son as king of Portugal instead of making the daughter queen because she was married to the King of Spain. I mean, that makes sense, given the history of colonization. Interestingly though, the story has a Game of Thrones twist. The city’s bishop was against this coronation and in protest, he didn’t ring the bells of the famous Lisbon cathedral. Fatal mistake, as soon after he was thrown out of the top window (yes, the window you see in this picture) in front of the entire city and it was still considered an honest “battle mistake.”
“Well, that's a Portuguese sense of humor and easy-going vibe for all of you” — concluded our tour guide.
Well, she didn't just leave us there. She also took us to this special street called Rua De Saudade to familiarise us with “Saudade”, a unique Portuguese term that doesn’t translate into any other language, and encompasses a feeling of longing, melancholy, and nostalgia.
This is the other layer to the Portuguese soul she said — an undercurrent of melancholy.
3. Fado Live Music Show
This is also what their traditional Fado music beautifully encapsulates. We were fortunate to find a nice show to enoy this music. We had such a great time experiencing this despite the language barrier, it was a perfect way to end our stay in Lisbon.
On day 4, the sky cleared. Until now we had decent weather too, but it was slightly chilly for me, especially in the evening. Staying indoors would have been a shame on a perfect sunny day like that, so since Sid was busy , I hopped on a quick 40-minute train ride to explore the beach town of Cascais by myself.
It turned out to be the best decision! As soon as the train left the Lisbon station, I was welcomed by the sparkling blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean. I wasn’t expecting the entire train ride to be this coastal. And when I reached, right off the bat I could feel the beach air. The city was bustling with people, but in a relaxing and rejuvenating way. And the vibe was lively and infectious.
Before I retired to the beach, I did a short walk around the town to check out some places I read about in the self-guided walking tour I found online. You see, Cascais is that kind of town where there are beaches plus a lot of other things to see as well.
Cascais was also great for retail therapy. I mean, leave me alone and I don’t come back with shopping bags — ask Sid if that has ever happened 😛
No, but seriously, I found both quality and price better here in Cascais than in Lisbon. And if those beautiful colorful cork products don’t attract you — nothing will. I was so excited to taking these beautiful pieces home and remember my sweet trip by.
==============================================================
I’ll come back to Portugal for more history in Porto, more culture in Algrave, and more commerce in Alentejo. But for now — it is island time and up next is Sao Miguel, Azores. Stay tuned, the next post coming soon!

If you look on Instagram, living abroad seems to be such an exciting, colourful, perfect experience. But more often than not, being an “immigrant” is much harder than it seems.
[Clarification, to me, you are not an “expat” until your company sends you to work abroad. If you choose to move in another country, you are an “immigrant”. Using the word “expat” only for temporary, rich and privileged (often Western) countries seems like a post-colonial term to me. We are all immigrants if we decide to live abroad.]
At the beginning everything is exciting and overwhelming at the same time. Then, you start feeling alone. You don’t speak the language. You’ve lost all the things that used to make you “you” before. Your little habits. It’s super hard to integrate.
There’s this saying that goes something like “the grass is greener in the neighbours’ garden”. Well, until you haven’t experienced it, I don’t think you can understand what it actually means.
After having lived in 5 different countries (France, Belgium, Hungary, Romania, Portugal), in 8 different cities, I can confidently say that there’s no such thing as one, perfect place that has it all. In the end it comes down to what you are looking for at a certain point in your life.
For example, some on the internet will have you believe that living in sunny Lisbon, Portugal is wonderful. It is, but few talk about the (very) low salaries locals have here and the struggle it is to make a living. How high the taxes are. The horror of bureaucracy. Or how expensive housing has become (same prices as in Paris!). How uncomfortable winters can be here, without central heating, proper isolation and as a result, mold infestation in the walls. How hard it is to make friends if you don’t speak the language. The list goes on.
I used to think that people in my home country (France) were all very negative. But then I met people who challenged my conception and I realised that you find negative people or even jerks, everywhere. Human beings tend to do this very funny thing called “projection” which is when someone projects his or her own perception onto something or someone else.
Generalising an experience is a dangerous exercise because in the end all experiences are very subjective and personal. Some will like living in “X” place, some will hate it. Don’t take everything you see or hear for the absolute truth. Challenge it. Ask yourself, would it make sense to me?
Also, the place you might hate could be paradise for someone else. Let’s keep an open mind about the reality of what life is actually like. Not in those “expats” bubbles or what “Instagram lifestyle gurus” preach.
Living abroad is fantastic, it’s also very hard. You grow a lot. You have to reinvent yourself, leave your comfort zone. It can also be very rewarding. You learn about yourself, about life, about letting go and adapting, about surviving. You might even start to appreciate some things you had “at home”.
Everyone should experience living abroad once in their life, if they have the opportunity to do so. Maybe if we did, we would be more tolerant and understanding of each other, more open, warm, welcoming… Maybe communities would actually flourish again. And the world would be a better place.

This blog post is the 4th article in the series. The collaboration between Dark Matter Labs and the Institute of Human Rights and Business (IHRB) has previously resulted in mapping of Copenhagen and Prague, and aims to continue its investigation further in Athens.
Through findings in this blog, we aim to flag the role of the state and city councils as active agents — alongside many others — shaping neoliberal development as opposed to the prevailing belief that solely the market forces may jeopardize spatial justice. The example of Lisbon shows that whereas transparent and accessible land ownership information is an important enabler for public oversight and policy, it is not the only key factor shaping a city’s ability to safeguard local livelihoods and affordability. This blog post expands on the thesis that land ownership patterns are foundational to spatial (in)justice, broadening the definition by encompassing the state- and city council-led regulatory mechanisms that govern property markets.
Lisbon is currently the 3rd most expensive city in Europe for rental accommodation. Given Portugal’s lower salary levels compared to other European member states, the recent penetration of vast amounts of foreign capital into the housing market has made everyday life increasingly unmanageable for its citizens.
Lisbon can be considered as a flagship example of the dynamics where the public debt of the European “semi-periphery” to the financial European and global market “core” (see: Lima, 2023) creditors turns the city into space for capital accumulation and its repayment. The public assets, municipal land, cultural heritage, housing, service sector and public space all become tools for economic growth often measured solely by abstract metrics such as real estate value appreciation.
Financialization means that even greater amounts of capital decoupled from the real economy and local realities (livelihoods, salaries etc.) flow into the city’s square meters turning them into financial assets that demand continuous returns on investments. In a context where finance is linked to space, new waves of capital need to continue finding physical room to act, with major impacts on people’s lives. The true debtors of this logic are not only the state or the municipality balance sheets, but the displaced citizens whose apartments needed to be freed for urban rehabilitation, struggling middle-class families facing soaring housing costs, the 22,812 families on the waiting list for social housing, and the young; future generations who might never afford a home, forced to live with their parents.
In Lisbon, state-aided deregulation of the rental market, commodification of the existing housing stock, land and new housing developments speculation are the forces that have shaped this condition. Based on existing research, this blog aims to explain these forces.
Due to a lack of data transparency, it is difficult to precisely assess and depict who owns land and properties in the city, as well as what are the historical transactions which could bring actors in power into the public eye. What is known, however, through qualitative interviews with leading housing justice researchers, is that the main factors that have been shaping the catastrophic housing affordability crisis in Lisbon are those known to many other cities in Europe.
The structure of the blog aims to guide the reader through the dynamics which led Lisbon to its current condition.
1. Role of the state — making ground for new capital
2. Large institutional investors & land ownership patterns
3. Data transparency review
4. Conclusion and recent developments
Neoliberalism involves preference for the extension of spontaneous (freed from state interference) competitiveness, market powers, and the belief in their ability to regulate economies efficiently. As it aims for a world where the state’s role is diminished, it paints a false picture of its passive role in the neoliberalisation of the economies. However, it’s precisely the state which, through a deliberate set of policies and regulations, provides the means through which the free market forces can spread their wings.
The case of Lisbon is exemplary, demonstrating that, in the context of property markets, instead of merely conforming to the free market doctrine, the state, and the municipal government chose to regulate in favour of the private sector to stimulate economic growth.
Against the backdrop of the 2008 financial crisis, the EU, Portuguese state, and Lisbon city government implemented, on the one hand, austerity measures resulting in the lowest public investment in housing in Europe, and on the other, multiple incentive mechanisms to attract foreign investment capital, aiming to repay the “Troika” loan, and re-stabilise the economy.
Neoliberalist logic moved Portugal away from its previous, more welfare-oriented system, creating a new state-craft infrastructure for market-oriented economic growth. Rather than being passive agents, the governing institutions actively retreated, creating room for the private market to rule.
To understand the reasons why Lisbon became so unaffordable, one needs to understand the set of historical events that turned the city, from being from a “high-risk” location, to a top investment destination in 2018 (the Emerging Trends in Real Estate European ranking, PwC & Urban Land Institute, 2018).
The developments which took place over two decades can be summarised as major trends of:
2. 1. Further financialisation of the housing stock through engagement of large- scale institutional investors
The first trend can be broken down further into three state-led and deliberate shaping mechanisms including:
Financing — Urban rehabilitation funding programmes that provided efficient financing infrastructure for renovations of the historical core
Deregulation — Simplification of urban rehabilitation rules
Liberalisation — Special tax incentives based on a desired economic turn towards commercial and tourist functions
Low taxation for EU citizens willing to relocate and invest
Incentives for wealthy transnationals willing to invest in the property market
o Liberalisation of the rental market through, among others,
The set of events shows that multiple incentives and deregulation rather than demand and supply issues led to the current unaffordability (see: Untaxed, Investigate Europe 2022).
The measures that led to the commodification of the historical core proved to be successful in terms of real estate investment returns. Following this first wave of investments, the perceived oversupply of luxury housing and scarcity of land for new large-scale investments in the central areas led institutional investors to bet on the peripheral plots of Lisbon’s metropolitan area.
A significant surge of almost 90% in building permits between 2017 and 2018 indicates this surge in large-scale investments, where substantial capital could be deployed. The adoption of a build-to-sell strategy ensured a secure exit option for institutional investors, who then facilitated the acquisition of ostensibly “affordable” housing from non-premium segments by smaller investors keen on subletting.
As highlighted by Lima, 2013, the narratives of the large investors shifted towards “long-term” investments targeting “the middle class”. Further narrative tools which the author points towards are:
Against the backdrop of liberalised rental laws, institutional investors drove the creation of a “new supply” of speculative rental apartment units extending beyond the historical core. This perpetuates the financialisation of housing, allowing the trend to proliferate and persist beyond the city centre.
The following illustration aims to capture the dynamics that led to Lisbon’s persisting unaffordability:
By complementing the great research of Lima, 2023 with our own investigations regarding land sizes, the following table shows the largest projects led by institutional investors in the Lisbon metropolitan area:
Link to the TABLE
Additionally the Map by Lima, 2023 shows locations of the projects.
Further research, including Lisbon’s Municipal Housing Charter’s, clearly indicates that the Municipality of Lisbon and State & Public Companies remain large landowners in the city (see maps).
We have created a map that combines this data.
Link to INTERACTIVE MAP
Interestingly, the Lisbon Land Registry function resides under the Ministry of Justice. The permanent certificate of land registry provides, online, all the data regarding a property, even the pending requests. It is always updated and available for consultation. The WEBSITE (INSTRUCTION (in Portuguese) of the Registo Predial Online offers the possibility of creating a ticket based on Town, parish (however, outdated taxonomy) and building number. The building number however can only be known if the interested party knows it (e.g. from a legal document such as a property sales contract) or applies for it in a physical office in Lisbon.
Application based on the property number (not land plot) is possible but costs 1 euro per entry (each apartment is one entry). For for purposes of this project, obtaining the scale of data would be simply beyond budget, and it may not even give much information on land. No data has therefore been purchased from this source.
As a test, a random search for buildings in the area of Santa Catarina (which is now part of the Misericórdia parish) revealed 650 possible buildings, several of which may contain multiple housing units. One could reduce the cost of the purchase by filtering out some buildings (for example, those known to be owned by the municipality), but this is not an option, as the cadaster building number is decoupled from its address.
Interviews with researchers conducting similar investigations (Cocola-Gant, A; Gago A.; Lima, R, and Silva R.) confirmed that large-scale land ownership investigations are an impossible or very costly task. Applications for buildings by their address costs 14 euro, need to be submitted via a physical office in Lisbon and are limited to 10 inquiries per day. According to some researchers, even the municipality’s own planning department may not have a clear overview on the municipal assets.
Lisbon serves as a prime illustration of how gentrification processes, initially disconnected from land ownership, originate in the city core and radiate outwards. Initially, urban rehabilitation efforts and incentives for transnational individuals and corporate investors attract foreign capital, which primarily targets properties such as apartments and housing units, and are not necessarily land focused. In the second instance, however, as the market matures, land plays an important role as the large-scale investors attracted by promising returns seek space for large-scale developments. Thus, as the property market in the central areas gets saturated, the new wave of large-scale investments provides a new supply of housing units, inflating the market further.
Amid rising cost of living, Lisbon city council has recently introduced measures to mitigate the effects of increased financialisation of the housing sector.
This February (2024) the municipality approved the new “Cooperativas 1ª Habitação Lisboa” programme which involves making municipal assets available to housing cooperatives for 90 years. This includes small plots of land for construction of affordable housing by the cooperatives. Furthermore, Lisbon’s Municipal Housing Charter just went through a 3-month long public consultation process (see also Civic Assembly’s website, the Report, and Maps). The Charter defines a strategy for the implementation of municipal housing policies between 2023 and 2033, representing an investment of 918 million euros. Its future is yet to be seen.
Special thanks to Agustín Cocola-Gant, Ana Gago, Rita Silva, Rafaella Lima for your valuable research and time sharing insights that enabled the writing of this blog post. In depth research, action and activism on the ground are the true powers able to change the trajectories of spatial injustice.

There is a certain pride in affirming the statement, “sou alfacinha” (I’m a little lettuce) when inquired by other Portuguese people about where in Portugal I am from.
Not that it isn’t already obvious from my bland accent. The one that, us Lisboners, call the ‘normal’ or ‘neutral’ Portuguese accent, but really is more of a muffled series of mumblings and swallowed word endings. Something resembling Spanish with a Russian accent, or so I’ve been told.
“Sou alfacinha”, I confirm, with a smile on my face. I smile, and then curl the sides of my mouth into an expression of confusion. Why on earth am I calling myself a lettuce? And a small one at that?
The expressions we provide on-demand, like automatized motions learned as toddlers, are often a complete mystery to us. We use them, seldom realizing what they actually mean.
Like a baton passed in an intergenerational rally race.
It’s a crisp morning. The kind that flaunts itself through the window as the day breaks. The sun is beaming through its seams and reflecting off the Atlantic coast, into the vast sky that paints the day blue.

Luxury travel, redefined. Changing the way you discover the world, one immersive experience at a time.

Carried by the river Tagus is the mix of food, architecture, spices, and cultures that have blended together over the course of centuries to create present-day Lisbon. With the lure of vibrant yellow trams, delicious custard tarts, and promises of charming nearby towns, the rest of the world is turning up to discover one of Europe’s oldest (and most beautiful) capital cities.
Kelsey Lash is our intrepid travel writer who recently deepened her love of the Portuguese capital during an incredible stay at the Four Seasons Hotel. Kelsey tapped into the expertise of Lisbon native and local guru, João Santana Domingos, to take you on an immersive journey through the vibrant streets, profound history and captivating culture of the City of Seven Hills.
Lisbon’s history, which shines through modernity, is best experienced through taste — and there’s no better way to sample that diversity than with petiscos. These small portions of diverse and adventurous dishes can be washed down with a glass of vinho verde, a young wine with a distinctive fresh and fruity palette, cultivated by small growers in the country’s historic Minho province. Taverns and trendy bars alike present the perfect opportunity to experience Portuguese cuisine and lifestyle in one atmospheric sitting. Head to Bairro do Avillez where seafood and fish are always on the menu and sample the specialty red giant shrimp and razor clams.
With an undulating cityscape of peaks and urban valleys, Lisbon, like Rome, has seven hills, each with its own breathtaking view. Hop aboard the Tram 28 and let it carry you to to Miradouro das Portas do Sol, where the views of the Alfama neighborhood are without comparison or set off for the Miradouro da Senhora do Monte with an elevated vantage point and a wide scope view of the city. Take a sunset stroll up to the sloping, verdant lawns of Parque Eduardo VII, a 62-acre public park with vistas of the Tagus and beyond. Salute yourself for a day’s worth of climbing at one of our favorite wine bar’s, By The Wine, found in the heart of the elegant Chiado neighborhood.
Portugal is blessed with over 1,000 kilometers of beaches, and Lisbon has some of the best. Protected from Portugal’s infamous swells, Cascais enjoys sandy beaches, a busy marina, and scenic seaside cliffs with the dramatic Boca do Inferno (Hell’s Mouth) rock formation. Ride the waves at Guincho, an ideal beach for surfing and other water sports. Stretching for miles, Costa de Caparica has fantastic facilities and is ideal for families. Explore the pristine beach of Portinho da Arrábida, complete with rolling terrain and white, sandy shores. Whether you get your kicks from riding the waves, hiking the shore or burying your toes in the sand, there is no limit to the city’s coastal offerings.
See Lisbon the way locals do through barrios that have stood the test of time. Home to a vibrant community of locals, a legion of cafes and shops, and a lively small-town atmosphere, Alvalade and Avenidas Novas neighborhoods entice residents and travelers alike. Another in-vogue neighborhood, Marvila, has transformed abandoned warehouses into workspaces, artisan breweries, and art galleries. Have a beer at Dois Corvos, where they created the first artisan beer ever produced in Lisbon.
At the center of Campo de Ourique is the eponymous market, Mercado de Campo de Ourique. Dating back to 1934, the former farmer’s market has been painstakingly refurbished, yet retains the authenticity of its heyday. Packed with gourmet food stands offering options for all manner of tastes and moods, the lively hangout spot is bursting with colors, flavors and locals at lunch.
Reflecting the metamorphosis of Lisbon, the LX Factory has breathed new life into a former manufacturing complex in the Alcântara neighborhood. Combining arts and an entrepreneurial spirit, the sprawling, multifaceted mall has become one of the city’s coolest hangouts, with bookstores, hip fashion boutiques, interior design outlets alongside artists’ ateliers — all under one urban-industrial roof.
Discover the beating heart of Lisbon in Fado music, a Portuguese folk song of melancholic character usually accompanied by guitar and a traditional Portuguese meal. Since the early 19th century, Fado (literally: “fate” or “destiny”) has been an important fixture in everyday life of the Portuguese working class, where fadistas draw locals into dark taverns to be serenaded. Themes of resignation command the performances, but hopefulness is weaved throughout, a reminder that each ending is also the start of a new beginning.
Painted tiles, known as azulejos, made their way to the Iberian Peninsula in the 14th century and have since become synonymous with Portuguese culture. Examples are omnipresent in Lisbon, from the exquisite facade of Fronteira Palace to the cartoon-style murals inside Oriente Station to huge openair artworks gracing walls across the city. For an immersive, interactive exploration of the aesthetic tradition, take an exclusive tile-making workshop with artisans at a family-owned factory in the Arrabida National Park area.
A fairytale of palaces and castles, Sintra has charmed travelers for centuries. Protected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, European Romantic architecture reigns, yet beneath the colorful exterior the region holds dark secrets from its past: The well of the Quinta da Regaleira estate hides a concealed network of tunnels once used in obscure masonic rituals. Back on the sunny side, there are ancient ruins, hiking trails, and sand beaches to be discovered. Take a tour in a 1940s replica sidecar, beginning on the coast in Roca Cape and weaving through the Estoril Coast and Cascais Bay, before reaching the village.
Nature reserves often conjure images of inland oases, but Arrábida Natural Park is different. The area comprises a stunning section of wild coastline backed by fertile lands yielding Moscatel and Periquita grape varieties; follow the Costa Azul wine route to sample the region’s terroir and locally produced cheeses. Located just an hour’s transfer from Lisbon, this piece of paradise is accessed via the iconic Ponte de 25 de Abril bridge, redolent of the globally renowned Golden Gate in San Francisco. After an adventurous arrival, relax on secluded white sand beaches, go dolphin watching, and dine on freshly caught fish. Distinguished views, lush hills, and limestone cliffs constitute numerous hiking trails, and your expert guide will lead you to the footprints of dinosaurs dating to the Jurassic era.

My very first impression of Lisbon was of a public parking lot taken over by gypsies. One guy, with the biggest tin of sausages I’ve ever seen, sidled up to the window of the campervan I was in with friends, & asked for a single euro, we handed it over without question. If there’s something everyone should know, it’s don’t mess with gypsies. When we came back at the end of the day the giant tin of sausages had been thrown, still 3/4 full, near one of the tyres, but the campervan was intact & as we left it. We considered that euro as the best value of the trip. I really regret not getting a photo of the sausages.
My lasting impression is that a visit to this city is a ticket to many beautiful experiences. The city has an energy, diversity, organised chaos & creativity that reflects a true metropolis.
» Triple bottom line, sustainability, (Socio-cultural, Economic & Environmental)I have now been to Lisbon 3 times, seeing 3 very different parts of the city & 3 very different experiences. Each visit building a picture of the city that I enjoy more each time. I think the public transport is one of the best I’ve seen. But, the major problem the city faces is that it seems like there’s a massive difference between the haves & the have-nots. If you catch a train or bus to Estação do Oriente you will see this fairly clearly. The only upside being that at least there is a sheltered place for people experiencing homelessness, a luxury not often afforded by people in the same situation in other cities, Vancouver comes to mind.
As a city that heavily relies on tourism, a blessing & curse for beautiful cities round the world, it has been subject to the highs & pitfalls of an industry that is never quite secure. The Portuguese were smart enough to create a digital nomad visa to attract location independent people from all over the world, which is adding a different layer to the economy & social mix. The only problem being that this causes impacts on living costs for residents.
Despite this, life is fairly cheap, food is exceptional & so is the wine. I walked through a shopping centre near Estação do Oriente while I waited for my bus & the place was completely packed with people loaded with shopping bags. But global labels selling well doesn’t mean much for the have nots.
Lisbon economic is the engine of the country, along with Porto, which is even moreso tourism focused. Lisbon has a focus of people, the city centre is only 100sqm with estimated 533,920 people but the outlying metropolitan area has over 3M people (worldpopulationreivew.com) & is the largest urban area in the EU.
To me Lisbon is a centre of creativity, artistry combined with technical proficiency. A great combination for design thinking. I can see that the people are open to social evolution, are connected to the global consciousness. I can see in the future this could really grow, expand & exported (as it already is).
» Tree canopy cover & evidence of biodiversityThis really depends where you are, apparently “approximately 8% of Lisbon is covered directly by canopy”(Franco & McDonald, 2018) & the feel on the ground is that there’s parts that are really green, but more parts that are not. I feel like I experienced therange of the spectrum with my last 2 visits, I stayed in complete opposite places. This is always good to do for a holistic view of a place, I like a little visit to a lower socio-economic place to bring me down to earth.
As far as biodiversity goes, I believe there is some left, I could hear birds & there was evidence of fauna in some of the parks. There are some really large parks which have wild parts to them, the below satelite map shows that there is large areas of greenspace, which you feel on the ground. There are breaks from the dense suburbs, which is an approach I actually really like, to densify housing & consolidate green space into large areas. A few small fish in the water, yes I did bring my snorkel mask like a total nerd.
Next time I go I want to spend a whole day walking around the large green space in the lower right hand corner of the below pic, Parque Florestal de Monsanto. I’ve been to the outskirts but in the middle, you can see the clearing about the road running through, this is a prison, it’s blurred out in Google maps, which always tickles the armpit of my curiosity. Even the prison in Wacol near Brisbane isn’t blurred out. I’m also interested in what Skycity is going to be like, which is in the middle of the greenspace closer to the middle of the image. Also indicated is Cascais for reference.
» Pedestrian, cyclists & motorcyclist friendlyI had so much fun cycling through Cascais when I was there. Cascais is a little out of Lisbon near the coast, but I think it still feels like an extension of the city out on the corner of the Tagus river & the Atlantic. In other parts of the city cycling is impossible because of the hills, but tuk-tuks are regulars now. In other parts it is normal to see confident cyclists getting about on the street & despite the heavy car traffic, they seem to be respected & allowed to take up space. I think partly because they’re also generally moving faster than said cars stuck in traffic. I think also partly because the Portuguese people seem very level headed & pragmatic, this said I would love to see more bike lanes painted in.
Yes, there are plenty of motorcycles getting about, there’s even a chapter of the Litas (a worldwide womxn only riding club) that exists there. It is the perfect place for getting around the skinny streets or getting out on the weekend.
» Public transport system effectiveness
I love a good short wait for a train & easy transfer to another line, & the system here delivers the goods. Ahhh :) Those accustomed to the shitshow of the Brisbane heavy rail system will also be enamoured with this one. I also like when a place has good people watching, which Lisbon provides, it’s not the veritable freak show in NYC, but you definitely want to be wearing sunglasses to check people out (in a non creepy way pls).
I also like how clean & comfortable the trains are. There are buses too, which I still haven’t been on, but from the maps it looks like a good amount of the city is well connected. Another good thing is that the transport card, which is cheap to buy, will get you everywhere in the greater metropolitan area, even to Cintra, the most magical fairy castle place I’ve ever seen.
» Residents experiencesI really think in this case it depends on where you live, thus why I was so glad to experience both sides of the proverbial tracks. I think that both sides have a good life, there’s all the opulence & luxury you can afford, at the same time there’s plenty of social, low cost housing, if you can get it. I think city possibly does the tired old dance of focusing funds to the streetscapes of the tourist & wealthy areas, but at the same time if you’re not wealthy there’s a lot of little stalls & hustles going on which can keep unskilled people going. I don’t doubt that the have-nots have it tough though.
I think I’d be interested to know how accessible university education is in Lisbon, I think this is going to be key to the future as the city’s population is aging. I think a well educated workforce has the potential to do better during the rough times ahead (for most cities) as retirees outweigh working adults. Some of the most intelligent, multilingual & interesting people I’ve ever met were Portuguese (shout out to Claudia Taborda, one of my lecturers at QUT), so I get the impression education is at a high level here.
• Now to the weirder things I care about
» Can I drink alone at a bar & not feel judged?For me yes, I have done this every time I’ve visited & loved the whole experience. I felt sexy & mysterious & was not subject to a single judgy face. As with Paris, I would drink or eat alone there any day. In fact I had one of the best Thai curries of my life at an Indian restaurant in Cascais watching motorcycle racing on the big screen at a table next to a guy doing the same. Couldn’t have felt more acceptable. I have a friend who lives there who often sends me photos of cocktails he’s drinking alone at the beachfront, sometimes he takes his cat, it all sounds like a dream. Also, I once went to a Fado restaurant, without booking, like a dummy, but managed to snag a seat opposite a truly interesting woman from Dubai, also getting about alone, we shared a plate of snacks, the enchanting music and single woman traveller stories, truly one of my most favourite nights, made possibly because I was solo.
» Are the plants realYes, lots of real plants in restaurants, can’t say I recall seeing many plastic plants getting about. But I haven’t been through the whole city yet so maybe next time I’ll notice it & need to do a retraction. There is so much bougainvillea doing really well, which just adds to the ambiance.
» Is it safe to walk alone at night?Yes, for me anyway. The last 2 times I was there I walked back to my accommodation alone late at night, in 2 very different areas, passing all sorts of characters, but felt safe. I may have made another woman feel unsafe as I followed her back to the guesthouse we were both staying at, she did not want to chat. Still useful to be street smart.
» Do people dance? (self consciousness rating)Yesss! Ah it’s very nice to see, people dancing at clubs, even in an afternoon, or on the beach next to the volleyball courts. There is a bit of an athletic vibe, especially with the younger adults, so I think dance ability comes with that.
» Is there cool old shit with cool stories, other than churches or cathedrals?So much! Books shops, bars, castles, just the cobbled streets are super interesting, the trams are great, this is a city for all senses, visual & taste especially. This is like the epicentre of non-religious cool old shit (plenty of old religious shit for those that way inclined).
» Pet trends, dogs in bars & dog parksI didn’t notice that many dogs to be honest with you, I think this speaks to the transitionary lifestyle people have here, but I did see some at the beachside cafes & they looked very welcome there, I wouldn’t think twice about having a dog in this city. Plenty of walkabouts to get up to, plenty of parks too.
» Do people stare at my tattoos? Are there alt folk about?I feel like this is the least starey place I’ve been, no one gives a shit, plenty of other tattooed people about, you can be whoever you want to be. I think this all goes with the general progressive & globally connected vibes. There is a continuation of tradition, but there’s also a tolerance & acceptance that I really like.
» General vibe notesIt’s just a cool city, not squeaky clean, has a certain amount of grit. But I think it’s a good place to get fat & happy — or fit & hippy. Up to you on that journey. All the food I had there was incredible. The people are lovely, & mostly speak English so it’s real easy for a dumb monolinguist like me (hot tip, more people speak English than Spanish, so don’t gracias, instead stick to either obrigada/o or thanks).
Not yet mentioned is the Pastel de Nata —this is very important! If you do one thing it’s visit Pastel de Belem, wait for as long as necessary, order an espresso & 2 pastels, don’t make the mistake of thinking 1 is sufficient, I think 6 is actually the correct amount.
I think one thing that could be a critique, is how it sprawls, even though there are places closer that could be renewed with some creativity & investment. This is the problem with older cities, there’s places that have been around for centuries, sometimes millennia, but who’s going to make a decision on removing the remains when they become useless. It’s a decision I don’t know the answer for, since I am from Brisbane which has a fairly rigorous demo & rebuild policy for anything over 15–40yrs old.
Not sure if anyone can tell this, but I would jump at the chance to live in Lisbon.

Lisbon, the capital city of Portugal, is a captivating blend of rich history, vibrant culture, and breathtaking landscapes. Nestled on the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula, Lisbon has long been a hub of exploration, trade, and cultural exchange. This article delves into the fascinating history of Lisbon, highlights its must-visit places, and provides insights on the best time to explore this enchanting city.
Lisbon’s history is a tapestry woven with diverse influences and remarkable events. The city’s origins can be traced back to the Phoenicians around 1200 BCE, who established a settlement called “Alis Ubbo.” Over the centuries, Lisbon was inhabited by various civilizations, including the Romans, Visigoths, and Moors, each leaving an indelible mark on the city’s culture and architecture.
Roman and Moorish Eras
During the Roman era, Lisbon, known as Olissipo, flourished as a significant trading post. The Romans constructed roads, bridges, and aqueducts, some of which still stand today. The fall of the Roman Empire saw Lisbon transition into the hands of the Visigoths and later the Moors. The Moors, who ruled from the 8th to the 12th century, infused the city with Islamic culture, architecture, and advancements in agriculture and science. The Alfama district, with its narrow winding streets and Moorish influences, remains a testament to this period.
The Age of Discovery
The 15th and 16th centuries marked Lisbon’s golden age during the Age of Discovery. Under the leadership of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portuguese explorers set sail from Lisbon, embarking on voyages that would change the world. Vasco da Gama’s discovery of the sea route to India in 1498 and subsequent expeditions established Lisbon as a global maritime power. The wealth and knowledge brought back by these explorers fueled the Renaissance in Portugal, leading to significant advancements in art, science, and architecture.
Earthquake and Reconstruction
The devastating earthquake of 1755, followed by a tsunami and fires, razed much of Lisbon to the ground. The Marquis of Pombal spearheaded the city’s reconstruction, implementing innovative urban planning and architectural techniques. The Baixa district, with its grid-like streets and neoclassical buildings, emerged from this reconstruction, symbolizing Lisbon’s resilience and rebirth.
Lisbon is a city that begs to be explored, with its historic neighborhoods, iconic landmarks, and cultural gems offering a rich tapestry of experiences for visitors.
Alfama: The Alfama district is the oldest neighborhood in Lisbon, characterized by its labyrinthine streets, traditional Fado music, and stunning viewpoints. Visitors can wander through its narrow alleys, visit the São Jorge Castle, and enjoy the panoramic views from Miradouro da Graça.
Belém: Belém is synonymous with Portugal’s Age of Discovery. This district is home to the iconic Belém Tower, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and the Jerónimos Monastery, a masterpiece of Manueline architecture. The Monument to the Discoveries, located along the Tagus River, pays tribute to the explorers who set sail from Lisbon.
Baixa and Chiado: Baixa and Chiado are bustling districts in the heart of Lisbon. Baixa is known for its elegant squares, such as Praça do Comércio and Rossio Square, as well as the Elevador de Santa Justa, a stunning neo-Gothic elevator offering panoramic views of the city. Chiado, on the other hand, is a cultural and commercial hub, with its theaters, bookstores, and vibrant cafés.
Bairro Alto: Bairro Alto is Lisbon’s bohemian quarter, famous for its lively nightlife and artistic atmosphere. As the sun sets, the neighborhood comes alive with Fado music, trendy bars, and restaurants serving traditional Portuguese cuisine. During the day, visitors can explore its unique shops and historic buildings.
LX Factory: LX Factory, a former industrial complex, has been transformed into a creative and cultural hub. Located in the Alcântara district, it features trendy shops, art galleries, restaurants, and a lively atmosphere. The iconic Ler Devagar bookstore, with its towering bookshelves and whimsical décor, is a must-visit.
Lisbon’s Mediterranean climate makes it an attractive destination year-round, but the best time to visit depends on your preferences and interests.
Spring (March to May): Spring is one of the best times to visit Lisbon, as the weather is mild and the city is in full bloom. The temperatures range from 15°C to 20°C (59°F to 68°F), making it perfect for exploring the city’s outdoor attractions. Additionally, the spring months see fewer tourists compared to the summer, providing a more relaxed experience.
Summer (June to August): Summer in Lisbon is warm and bustling with activity. Temperatures can soar to 30°C (86°F) or higher, making it ideal for enjoying the city’s beaches and outdoor festivals. However, this is also the peak tourist season, so expect larger crowds and higher prices for accommodation and attractions.
Autumn (September to November): Autumn is another excellent time to visit Lisbon, with pleasant temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). The summer crowds begin to thin out, and the city’s parks and gardens are adorned with vibrant fall colors. September, in particular, is a great month to experience the city’s cultural events and festivals.
Winter (December to February): Winter in Lisbon is mild compared to other European cities, with temperatures rarely dropping below 8°C (46°F). While there may be occasional rain, the city remains lively with Christmas markets, festive lights, and cultural events. Winter is also the off-peak season, offering more affordable accommodation options.
Lisbon is a city that seamlessly blends its rich historical heritage with contemporary culture and vibrant energy. From its ancient neighborhoods and iconic landmarks to its creative hubs and lively districts, Lisbon offers a diverse range of experiences for every traveler. Whether you’re exploring the narrow streets of Alfama, marveling at the architectural wonders of Belém, or enjoying the nightlife in Bairro Alto, Lisbon promises a journey filled with discovery and enchantment. Additionally, check holidays in Portugal prior to travel to improve your overall tour experience. So, pack your bags and set out to explore this captivating city, where the past and present converge in a harmonious symphony of culture, history, and adventure.

Given a choice, I would any day pick either Braga or Porto over Lisbon and skip the latter altogether. The capital of Portugal is a beautiful city, no doubt, but it is also predictably touristy and, as such, immensely avoidable after a mandatory trip, or two. Having said that, it doesn’t always happen as per your wish.
During a recent trip to Lisbon, I made an earnest attempt to camouflage my prejudice, ensured the person accompanying me got to enjoy the best of everything Portugal’s capital city has to offer, and eventually didn’t regret making yet another visit to a city I have honestly got bored with. On an interesting note, I faced a unique predicament during my stay.
Football fans will be aware that the domestic season in Portugal got over recently, and I believe there is no better time to discuss my predicament. That the 2024–25 edition of the Primeira Liga went right down to the wire didn’t come across as a surprise. It was the 34th (and final) round of matches that decided the winner.

I arrived at the cafe/bakery and thought about getting a number to be served. Before I could do it, a nice man gave me his number. This is a Portuguese way of living. They are always helpful.
It was so relaxing to sit in the bakery and have coffee with a croissant. I could stay there all day just writing and drawing, or people-watching.
And or walking on the banks of the river on Parque das Nações.
Today I had codfish with spinach and chickpea puree. And then again, in a different way, as a snack with apple juice and strawberry. You can find all kinds of fish everywhere you go here.
On the banks of the Tagus River, I was surprised and happy to hear a Brazilian song.
I recently had the opportunity to visit Lisbon, the capital of Portugal again. I immediately felt at home with the city’s beauty, its rich history, and its vibrant culture. There is art everywhere.

Beyond here, there’s nothing. Ne plus ultra, the Romans carved on the Pillars of Hercules at the narrow neck where Spain almost, almost touches Africa.
They were talking about the wild, tempest-tossed Atlantic, of course. A swelling, storming, steel-grey wilderness that devoured their ships the way killer whales now devour the rudders of billionaire’s yachts.
Ignore the warning. You can sail out between the pillars of Hercules. The Romans knew that.
The wild Atlantic swallowed Ulysses, but more modest men of cunning made their way tortuously along the coast to Lisbon. In Alfama, the ancient fishing district with an Arabic name that survived the 1755 earthquake that reshaped the city entirely, you can still see the ruins of the Roman empire’s last settlement before the sea.
Lisbon is the westernmost city in Europe. And after visiting every capital city in Western Europe, after traveling from Sicily to Stockholm and from Warsaw to Wrexham, Lisbon, and Portugal as a whole, remained a barely explicable gap in our charted territory.
We liked it right away.

Blink and you will miss the tiny little pride flags stuck in the windows of shops and cafes in Lisbon. Blink and you might miss its queer culture entirely.
When I first visited Lisbon’s unofficial “gay village” it was a culture shock in comparison to the vibrant gay village of my city, Montreal. Nestled among the hip streets of Lisbon’s Bairro Alto district, the streets looked like any other. If I had not gone on the queer walking tour that I found on AirBnB Experiences, I might have assumed there was very little openly queer culture in Lisbon.
How delightfully wrong I was! Lisbon showed me that there are many ways different countries express and celebrate LGBTQ culture. While in Canada we feel that queer expression must be loud and visible, Portugal seemed to take a laid-back approach that felt fitting for their more laid-back approach to life.
Beautiful tiled buildings cast shade upon the Bairro Alto’s carefully crafted stone streets. Cozy tables and chairs were set up on wide sidewalks outside restaurants that smelled of herbs, fish and a smattering of international cuisines.
I had walked these same streets during the day; they were quiet aside from a few shoppers and seniors chattering about life as they strolled. As I…

October 18, 2022|Portugal
Ah, the Alfama district of Lisbon! Land of incipient heart attacks and broken ankles. Spoiler Alert — I avoided both. Narrowly.
Before I get into today’s festivities, let’s back up to yesterday (or actually the day before) when I left San Francisco on my latest quest to visit slightly off the beaten path destinations before I get too decrepit to visit them. This trip will take me to Morocco.
But first, a stop in Lisbon.
I managed to snag another insanely cheap fare to Lisbon — $375 round trip! The downside was that I had to fly through Munich. The upside was that I flew through Munich which meant that I got to go through EU immigration in Munich instead of Lisbon — which based on recent experience, probably saved me about 2 hours of standing in line. Honestly, I think it was a good tradeoff, especially considering the price point.
I arrived in Lisbon late — nearly 10:00 p.m. Because I was arriving late and my stay is so short, I decided to splurge (by my standards) and stay at the Melia Airport hotel. After waiting too long for my bag (but hey, it showed up), I walked across the street, checked in, took a shower and went to bed. I can’t remember the last time I arrived at a foreign destination at bedtime, but I consider that to be a complete luxury…

Lisbon may not be the first city that comes to mind for most people wanting to visit a European capital. However, don’t let this be a reflection on what the city has to offer. On the contrary, having been asked for pointers quite a few times over the years, I’ve decided to compile a list of 7 things that are off the beaten path, absolutely worth doing should you visit or live there. These should give you a small taste of the potential that this three thousand year old city hides.
Lisbon has a 4km long aqueduct built in the 18th century. Many people know of the large arch that cuts across the Alcântara valley:
However, far less well known is the fact that it cuts deep into the city centre, and that you can walk inside it, and see some beautiful monuments on the way. This path is part of the City-wide “Water Museum” that is currently being developed and begins at the “Mãe d’Água”, the largest water reservoir of the structure.
This gorgeous monument offers some great views of the city which I shall not spoil for you here. The next step is to head to nearby Príncipe Real and head underneath the park into another reservoir, the Patriarcal.
This is where you can take a really pleasant guided tour along 4oom of tunnels that pass underneath the streets of the city.
At the time of writing, the tunnels lead all the way to the São Pedro de Alcântara view point, where you can join other tourists. However, the city is currently expanding the length of tunnels accessible by foot.
Portugal does not have a rich history of beer. The Portuguese are well known for their love of wine, having some of the best bottles in the world produced there, and the Portuguese culture is built much more around wine that it is around beer. It is quite ordinary to see people drinking wine at lunch and dinner rather than beer, as is more common in Northern and Eastern Europe. Having said that, Lisbon and Oporto have jumped on the craft beer bandwagon with roaring success, and these local delicacies can be enjoyed at a variety of places throughout the capital. There is a great list of places here which I will summarise:
Update: Check out Musa in Marvila.
The reason Lisbon was built in its current location, and one of the main factors of its historical prominence, is the Tagus river delta. The Tagus is the longest river in the Iberian peninsula and its enormous reverse-delta is home to dolphins, flamingos and amazing views over the city. One of the best things to do in the city is to hop on a sail-boat and do a 2 hour cruise of the delta at sunset.
Lisbon is quite unique in comparison to the other European capitals when it comes to museums. You won’t find a Louvre, National Gallery, or Prado here. What you will find however, is a large amount of excellent small to mid-sized museums all over the city, catering to every taste. I’ll spare the reader another long list and link to this blog which has a comprehensive one. To that list I’ll add a couple more that should be at the top of your list:
2. Under-dogs Gallery — Lisbon’s best street art gallery. It doesn’t limit itself to just street art, however:
Lisbon’s music scene is UGE as some might say. The city offers a regular serving of all types of genres, scenes and festivals all year round. The centuries-old multicultural environment has always been a fertile ground for original music output, and you can hear European, Brazilian, African, Indian and SE Asian music scenes come together in a setting unmatched anywhere else in the world.
A few highlights:
Venues:
Labels:
Events:
Special mention to this wine bar located inside one of the watering holes that used to quench the city’s thirst. Incidentally, it’s one of the end points of the aforementioned aqueduct, although this stretch isn’t accessible to the public (maybe try asking the owners of the wine bar).
With the largest amount of sunlight hours per year of any European capital, it’s only natural that Lisbon’s sunsets would live up to the city’ sunny reputation. Great spots to enjoy these are:
Equally stunning are the sunrises from some of the nightclubs like Lux.

I hope this brief list gives you some idea of the huge amount of things to do there. If you have any more tips or have specific questions, feel free to leave them in the comments!

Lisbon is full of surprises. It doesn’t matter if you have visited it a thousand times, there will always be another little street, corner or “beco” that will lead you to a new square or to a colorful building that you have never seen before. Here is a guide that will lead you to those beautiful not-that-well-known neighborhoods!
If you have been in Lisbon, it is likely that you have seen the Assembleia da República (Portugal’s chamber of Congress) or the Basílica da Estrela. Well, not that far from those places, there is a little neighborhood that has survived the last waves of tourism. It’s called Madragoa, and it’s one of the most authentic and beautiful places in Lisbon!
José Saramago, a portuguese writer and Nobel prize winner, lived in Madragoa. About it, he wrote: “in one of the hillsides of Lapa, it’s Madragoa, named that way after the people of the sea (or “mar”, in portuguese) came to live here after the XVI century”.
You can walk through the Rua da Esperança (the same street where Saramago lived) and see some cozy little coffee shops and traditional Tascas, or go uphill to Rua das Madres and be amazed with the colours of typical Lisbon’s houses.
2. Penha da Franca
Penha da França it’s located above Arroios neighborhood, and right next to Graça. And even though it’s centrally located, not that many tourists knows about it. A main reason why many young locals have chosen this area to live.
Penha da França features two amazing view points: the Miradouro do Monte Agudo and the Miradouro da Penha da França. Also, you’ll find delicious nepalese restaurants, proper portuguese’s tascas and interesting antique shops. You can even go to the Alto de São João cemetery, which has unique monuments and amazing river views.
And because of it’s location, you can walk right into it! From OnJ S. Lázaro hotel, you’ll only have to walk through Avenida Almirante Reis, and the go uphill taking one of the many stairs, like the one in Rua Cidade de Manchester or Rua Cidade de Cardiff.
3. Bica
To be fair, it is likely that the Bica elevator will appear on your travel guide, or at least that your tour guide will recommend it to you. Not of that matters: we still think that the Bica neighborhood is wildly underrated.
First, as you can see from the main photography of this article (made by notorious @francisco_crocco), Bica is huge, colorful and hilly. Second: in the past years, it has become one of the coolest neighborhoods in Lisbon, and a lot of new restaurants have opened there, mainly in the Rua de Sao Paulo.
The stairs, the little squares or “largos”, and the notorious Miradouro de Santa Catarina definitely need a longer visit.
4. Obvioulsy, you can’t miss the rest of Lisbon!
By highlighting these neighborhoods of Lisbon, we don’t mean for you to skip the beautiful Alfama, Graça, Baixa or Bairro Alto.
As we said before, if you come to Lisbon, you’ll never stop to discover new corners to fall in love with.
Check out the rest of our posts, and see waht they have to offer!

Posted: 10/28/2021 | October 28th, 2021
When I first went to Lisbon in 2012, I immediately fell in love with it. Hilly, colorful, beautiful, and full of wonderful food — it was everything I wanted. And the fact that it was very inexpensive didn’t hurt either.
Pre-COVID, Lisbon’s secret got out. Tourists flocked here in droves, and it became a magnet for digital nomads. While the crowds are greater and the prices are higher than before, Lisbon’s charm hasn’t been fully lost. The food scene is still excellent (and underrated if you ask me). The bars are lively. And the street scene is always intoxicatingly fun.
Plus, compared to other capitals in Europe, Lisbon is still a bargain.
The city’s 11 neighborhoods all have their own unique characteristics, providing visitors with a wide variety of locales to choose from. From achingly charming Alfama to the always swinging Bairro Alto, there’s something for everyone.
But before we dive in, here are some of the most common questions I get about Lisbon:
What’s the best neighborhood for budget travelers? Baixa and Rossio are home to many of the city’s hostels, making it a good hub for budget travelers.
What’s the best neighborhood for families? Modern, somewhat futuristic-looking Parque das Nações is loaded with family-oriented attractions, including the Oceanarium, Europe’s largest indoor aquarium.
What’s the best neighborhood for partying? Crammed with tiny bars and restaurants, Bairro Alto is the place to go at night in Lisbon.
What is the best neighborhood, overall? Alfama is a fun place to hang out for a while. It’s old (it survived the big earthquake of 1755) so it still has a timeworn atmosphere. And it’s the best place to pop into a bar to catch a fado concert.
So, with those questions answered, here’s a breakdown of seven neighborhoods with suggested accommodations for each:
Lisbon Neighborhood Overview
Located beneath the walls of São Jorge (St. George) Castle, this hilly medieval district — one of the oldest neighborhoods in Lisbon, along with nearby Alfama — actually means “Moorish Quarter,” because it was once where the Moors resided centuries ago.
Today it has a large Asian population, who go about their daily lives in a neighborhood that oozes with charm and history: its winding cobblestone streets are flanked by medieval buildings. And one of its main historical reputations is that it is the birthplace of fado, a singular Portuguese genre of music that can best described as mesmeric and melancholy.
Best Places to Stay in Mouraria:
There wasn’t much to see here about three decades ago. Then the city deemed this eastern swath the home of Expo ’98, otherwise known as the World’s Fair, and the area was transformed into a modern, somewhat futuristic park. If you’re into contemporary architecture, this is the place for you. If you’re a traveling family, this is also the place for you. The area includes cable cars, Europe’s biggest aquarium, a waterfront promenade (with lots of great public art), and an interactive science museum. It’s also very quiet here.
The Best Places to Stay in Parque das Nações
Literally meaning High or Upper Neighborhood, Bairro Alto oozes with tranquil Portuguese charm. Once the sun goes down, though, the party starts — especially on Friday and Saturday nights, when there are street parties galore. Tiny bars spill out onto the sidewalks, candle-lit eateries serve up local staples, and people everywhere are just in party mode.
During the day, come for the outstanding viewpoints and the awe-inducing Baroque churches. At night, come to wander the narrow 16th-century streets and do a street-party crawl. But don’t wear out the soles of your shoes — jump on the classic funicular (cable car, one of several the city is known for) up or down the hill.
The Best Places to Stay in Bairro Alto
Some of Europe’s most charming neighborhoods include Trastevere in Rome, Mala Strana in Prague, and Montmartre in Paris. Add Alfama to that list. It’s achingly charming, especially when you add in some fado — Portugal’s heartbreaking, melancholic genre of music that you can hear everywhere in Alfama.
The neighborhood was one of the few districts that survived the infamous 1755 earthquake. So, stroll its narrow, hilly streets and get a sense of what pre-quake Lisbon was like. It’s also home to São Jorge Castle, Lisbon Cathedral, and the decorative tile-loaded São Vicente de Fora Monastery.
The Best Places to Stay in Alfama
Translated as “Sodré’s Wharf,” this micro-neighborhood is dominated by the city’s main food market, Mercado da Ribeira, which today is also known as the Time Out Market. It’s a collection of stalls from some of Lisbon’s best restaurants and food purveyors and the place to go for food-loving travelers. The streets surrounding the market are flanked by various bars and restaurants, and street parties break out here seemingly 24/7.
At night, don’t miss Pink Street, a pink-painted pedestrian street teeming with fun-loving people every night of the week.
The Best Places to Stay in Cais do Sodré
This is the river meets history, where Vasco de Gama and Christopher Columbus embarked and disembarked. It’s where Portugal’s one-time powerful empire set sail for the rest of the world. Today Belém is an aesthetically pleasing part of town that is also crammed with great museums. Be sure to check out the Museum of Art, Architecture, and Technology (MAAT), the Berardo Collection, the Folk Art Museum, the National Archeology Museum, and the Maritime Museum, not to mention the Jerónimos Monastery.
Also, next to the monastery is Pastéis de Belém, one of the best/busiest places in the city to get the famous pastéis de nata (egg custard tart).
Best Places to Stay in Belém:
It’s not officially a neighborhood, but this long avenue has its very own vibe. Need some designer shoes? A designer handbag? A designer anything? This is the area to shop ’til you drop. The long and wide Champs-Élysées-like street is also a lovely place to stroll. And it’s all very parklike. While the verdant Avenida is bustling at times because of the traffic, it can be very tranquil too.
Where to Stay on Avenida da Liberdade:
These two neighborhoods make up much of the city’s main tourist core. Lined with pedestrian streets, there is a lot of Neoclassical architecture here, built after the massive earthquake in 1755. There are tons of eateries, as well as tacky souvenir shops to browse around the district, and the popular Museum of Contemporary Art can also be found here. Be sure to spend some time strolling around the popular Commerce Square.

Lisbon is a fascinating and underrated metropolis. It gets much less attention than other Western European capitals, but I think it should be on everyone’s must-see list. And if you’ve already been, put it on your must-see-again list. It’s worth it.

Just a short flight from London is the city of Lisbon. The Portuguese capital has become hugely popular lately as a travel destination. With cute architecture, delicious cuisine and gorgeous views, it is no wonder why so many people are stopping by. A few days in Lisbon is a welcomed break, with sunshine and lots to see, do and eat. A perfect place for a weekend getaway!
Located on the West side of Portugal, the city’s airport is a travel hub for those flying in. In fact, I was surprised by the large size of the airport and the number of flights coming in from London, the rest of Europe and the States. TAP Portugal are aggressively expanding but has been relatively less heard of in the travel world. I was pleasantly surprised by the flights to and from London and would recommend flying with them when planning your visit it Lisbon. Added bonus is that the airline’s flight crew has been named most handsome crew!
Top tip for booking flights is to use sites such as Kayak to find the best deals.
Once you have landed, get yourself an Uber (referral) or try out Kapten (code) and head towards your hotel. Lisbon is a relatively small city, so a cab ride into the city is pretty affordable and quick! I am a big fan of using Airbnb when I travel and was so glad to have done so in Lisbon! I stayed at Joanna’s flat, where I had a large, comfortable and artsy room, in the quiet back streets of the city. It gave me a real taste of living like a local, where the hosts gave me loads of tips and recommendations. Their dogs and cats were super friendly too!
For those who haven’t had their first Airbnb experience, what are you waiting for?! Give it a go in Lisbon and you won’t be disappointed. Make sure to use my referral code and do loads of research on the property before you book. Those who have had bad experiences tend to forget to checkout the comments, reviews and photos! For those looking for more traditional accommodation, make sure to use sites like Booking.com, Agoda and even Hostelworld to get the best deals. Hotels are all pretty affordable in Lisbon, so choose one that is central and looks comfortable!
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -
Start your visit with a trip to the Time Out Market, an enormous food market in the centre of town serving up some unique and delicious dishes. The food hall is packed with restaurants and stalls, serving up some of the most incredible seafood, cold cut meats and delicious local dishes! Do be mindful that during peak hours, it might take a while to get a seat and table. Make sure to check out the store that only sells canned food!
Lisbon is famously known as the City of Seven Hills. This means that pretty much every corner or street you walk down, you will somehow end up walking up one of the hills. This also means that there are numerous lookout points around the city that all offer some incredible views! There is something mesmerizing about those tiled roofs, all in that gorgeous orange!
A walk around Lisbon and you will discover endless cute little streets, squares, monuments and beautifully decorated buildings. This makes getting lost a real treat!
For those who don’t fancy too much hill walking, take the famous Tram 28 and go for a little tour around town. It is a great way to get away from the heat while seeing loads of the city.
The best way to get to know a city is through a free walking tour! They are usually run by genuine people who know the city and you will end up only paying for what you want. These are normally tip based services and you quite literally decide how much the tour was worth at the end. I usually look for tours run by Sandeman’s- they are really enjoyable, dynamic and run by fun guides!
The tour gives you a deep understanding of the city’s history, local heroes, top spots and great tips for the rest of your stay in Lisbon. Some of my highlights were the oldest book store in the world, endless squares, the Santa Justa lift and some incredible city stories!
Just outside of the center of Lisbon is the historical area of Belem. You should spend at least half a day or a morning in this area. The first stop would be to get to Pastéis de Belém early in the morning, before the queues start. This is the world most famous bakery shop that sells the best pastel de nata in town. It is freshly made in store and the queue gets really long. So definitely get there for their 8am opening. You cannot beat a hot pastry first thing in the morning, with a nice cup of coffee.
After your heavy and sweet breakfast, you could stop by the Palace and do a quick tour, or check out the Jerónimos Monastery. I skipped the Palace and headed for the later, where I was met with a grand looking building with incredible interiors. This monastery was opened in 1495 and still has regular services.
The last part of the morning in Belem would be a nice gentle stroll down the riverside. You will first see Padrão dos Descobrimentos, a monument representing the concept of Portuguese exploration.
It is such a nice little walk along the river, with plenty of cafes and restaurants to sit at and people watch. Before you know it, you will have reached the Belem Tower, a medieval defensive tower that is worth stopping for photos. What a nice morning spent in Belem!
This neighborhood in central Lisbon is worth exploring and wondering around. It has this really nice vibe to it, with low buildings and lots of bars! Definitely a spot to pop by for some drinks! Wine lovers have to head to BA Wine Bar — this is a cute little spot serving up some great local wines!
One of the best things I managed to experience in Lisbon was an intimate Fado performance. Fado is a music genre from 1820s and usually played by a small band with some very intense singing and usually portraying some very emotional and sad events. The songs are all in Portuguese but you can really feel the emotions from the music and the singing alone. It is an experience really worth having! So much emotion. I would suggest heading to Mascote da Atalaia in Barrio Alto the day before to book a spot for dinner the next day. The food is decent, there is this amazing sparkling white wine on tap and the music is just completely out of the world!
The last area of Lisbon worth mentioning is Alfama. During the day, the tiny and cobbled streets are filled with old grandmas shouting at each other and having a good time. At night, it is where all the bars and parties are at! This former red light district was ironically the only area in the whole of Lisbon that did not get destroyed during the last massive earthquake! You can walk down the streets at night and head into any bar, fado or restaurant, to really get a taste of Lisbon’s night life!
One of my favorite travel shows is Somebody Feed Phil. This short series is really centered around places to eat and is based around a city per episode. When Phil was in Lisbon, there was one restaurant that I just knew I had to go check out — Ponto Final. A short ferry ride from the centre of Lisbon and you will be on the other side, with some of the best views of the city. About a 15 minute walk along the waters and you will come across this cute little restaurant literally on the side of the water! Make sure to call well in advance if you want a table on the edge. It is definitely worth it, especially with the view of the whole of Lisbon. Perfect while you feast on the freshest seafood ever — grilled fish, octopus and all. I spent a ridiculous amount of time here for lunch (3 hours!). It was so relaxing with incredible food and great wine too! A definite must when in Lisbon.
For more traditional Portuguese or local food, there are two decent spots in town. One is Taberna da Rua das Flores, a super cute and artisan tavern-like contemporary restaurant. The food was seasonal, with black boards as menu. The staff are nice enough to point out each dish in detail and recommended things to try. Its like Portuguese tapas, sharing small plates and trying lots of different things! The dim lighting and vibe makes this place really intimate for dates as well!
Word of caution — this place is very popular! I went at around 6pm and was asked to come back 1.5 hours later! It is a small place and it is fair enough. Pop your name down and then head next door to By The Wine for some quality local wines and snacks.
For a more traditional setting, try out Casa do Alentejo. This is an old palace that was built around the 17th century and contains some beautiful mosaics and interior designs. Finding the spot was a bit challenging but once inside from the busy high street, you enter into a tranquil courtyard and get absolutely transported into some Spanish or Moorish setting. I spent some time walking around just to see the place! The stairs and the interior were all really well designed and preserved.
Food was served upstairs and consisted of great local dishes from the Alentejo region, with the likes of lamb stews, pork loins and rabbit. What makes this place so special is the dining hall. One of the most incredibly designed places I have eaten at!
Peri Peri What? How can you come to Portugal and not try out the famous Peri Peri chicken? Rumour has it that Frangasqueira Nacional has the best chicken in town. This little take out spot is famous for the meat and runs out of chicken on most days! I was so looking forward to this but only to find out that it was closed on a bank holiday! Feeling gutted, I walked aimless around the empty streets to find an alternative. Luckily, I walked into a little park with a small spot for dinner. In a green house like building is Esplanada Cafe. This is such a cute spot with large open windows and is a perfect place to sit and sip wine and enjoy some gorgeous chicken! One of the most relaxed evenings I had in Lisbon!
Lisbon was such a lovely city to explore and enjoy. This is a perfect destination for a long weekend. Spend a few days in the city and you will be eating great seafood, getting lost in beautiful architecture and learning so much about the history and life of this great city! Stay tuned for my next post — a day trip to Sintra!

How to spend few days in Lisbon without rushing but enjoying the city and working a bit
I visited Lisbon a few days ago. I wasn’t planning much beforehand, went to places as I felt for it. I read few blog posts about Lisbon and Portugal in general but did not had much expectations other than it’s cool city and I will have fun for sure. I knew a few friends that were in Lisbon whom I wanted to meet with otherwise had not much of a plans. I got recommendations for a very few spots to see but I used google maps for the most of the things.
I met some crypto people at The Block Cafe which is hosting networking event every Friday from 6pm, search for it on meetup.com for more info.
I bought the first day metro card at the machine at subway and used it pretty lot during the day. Metro is super clean and safe although I didn’t felt for riding it in night as the taxi is pretty cheap. For taxi I was using Bolt which is European version of Uber and it works great, the taxi is cheap and it was usually around 5€ for like 2–3km ride which is not that bad. Even taxi to the airport was around 10€ which is amazing.
I wasn’t really aiming to go to places but I wanted to have fun. I havent been to many places as I was working in the morning and spend some time hanging out at friends places. Here’s list of places that I’ve been to:
It’s Portugal and so food experience is very unique, in terms of there’s so many pretty bad restaurants or just super basic ones that are okay but you want to get the experience. I’ve been always eating out but here’s my list of fav places that I kept coming back to or I visited and was just blown away. I did not eat at many places as I was eating lot of pastel de nata.
I just love them and last days I was eating like 6–8 a day just because it’s love (don’t judge me plz). My rank of pastel de nata based on how much i liked them. Here is my rank:
I think I will just keep coming back to Brasileira as its in a great location.
Lisbon has some nice rooftop restaurants and bars. Here are the ones that I visited and loved them!
I had nice time in Lisbon and I hope you will have too, just be ready for slow down. Lisbon is very slow city and everything takes for ever. You will experience it in restaurants, be patient. If you want just quick food fast ask for takeout and pay immediately.
I did not added links to the places as you can just google them using google maps. I also created Lisbon must visit highlight on my Instagram profile with pictures from these places. Follow me on Instagram for more adventures @anett.rolikova

When you think of finding your way around in places that are unknown, you rely on GPS and your phone to help you get there. Back in 2016, when I was exploring Lisboa (Lisbon), Portugal, I found myself in the Alfama district. It’s one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city and possibly one of the most confusing places you could be in.
As I walked through the neighborhood, I found myself lost in a seemingly endless maze of narrow, winding staircases and hidden alleys. Without the help of GPS or the internet, I had to rely on my sense of direction to find my way around. Turns out, that sense was non-existent.
Despite feeling completely disoriented, exploring Alfama was an adventure in itself. Around every turn, I found unexpected surprises: charming courtyards, hidden plazas, and laundry drying in the sun. It was like I had stepped back in time, and I was happy to be lost in this labyrinth.
Eventually, I managed to find my way back to civilization, but I wouldn’t have regretted getting lost in Alfama. Navigating through the district’s twisting streets turned out to be a memorable experience.
Exploring Alfama district is an unforgettable experience of getting lost in a labyrinthine of narrow streets and it’s one of the most interesting neighborhood designs I’ve ever seen. After all, getting lost in such an ancient area is not a bad thing, but a chance to explore its wonders one inch at a time.

When we began planning to relocate to Portugal in 2022, I was excited for the opportunity to ditch my car and use public transit — especially trains — to get around.
And for the most part that's what we've done: we don't own a car, and we get around the center of Lisbon by public transit, with the occasional bit of frustration when a bus arrives late or a metro carriage is packed to the brim with commuters.
Comboio Portugal's trains can get you around most of Portugal without too much difficulty, but we were disappointed to discover that there were no easy routes out of Portugal and into Spain — much less into the greater continental system of trains that crisscross Europe.
But what do I mean by an ""easy route?""
The main issue is that — due to a limited number of train schedules — it is not possible to travel from one end of the peninsula to the other without an overnight stay somewhere near the middle. The limited number of departures — and indeed the speed of the route itself — mean that it's not possible to do even if you catch the first train out of Lisbon or Barcelona early in the morning.
Badajoz is a Spanish city in the ancient and contested border region of Extremadura (Estremoz in Portuguese). It’s a medium-sized city that seems to be well-accommodated, with historical relevance dating back to pre-Roman times.
But key to our attention is the fact that Badajoz is the current nexus of Portugal's train service, Comboio Portugal, and Spain's primary rail carrier, Renfe. Here the two services join at a small but functional station.
But your problems originating from Lisbon actually begin before you reach Badajoz, at a small city in Santarém called Entroncamento.
Entroncamento is where the relatively-fast Intercidades train service from Lisboa Oriente switches to the slow, frequently-stopping Regional service from Comboio Portugal. There are no direct trains from Lisbon to Badajoz, and you must switch at Entroncamento, with the same being true going the other direction.
The Regional service from Entroncamento is on a small, two-carriage train that makes 16 stops along the way and takes almost 3 hours to make the journey between Entroncamento and Badajoz. It's not entirely uncomfortable, but it is not fast, and the stops are frequent. But they are also some of the most charming stops along the route, and they offer some of the most beautiful vistas of Portugal's interior.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is likewise beautiful. It's accomplished on Renfe's Alvia service, and is much more comfortable than the journey between Badajoz and Entroncamento. The Alvia has comfortable, assigned seats, air conditioning, and a cafeteria car. It's much more like the Comboio Portugal Intercidades service, and it offers gorgeous views of Spain's snow-capped Sierra de Gredos mountains.
Gazing out the window of either the Renfe or CP trains, it's easy to imagine the Iberian countryside of Hemingway's cock and bull stories — gentle brooks that wind past the ruins of old stone fences, among low-slung green hills dotted with the outlines of black bulls and cork trees. This scene blends uninterrupted on either side of the border for a 100km stretch, making it impossible to know which country you're in.
On the Portuguese side of the line, I saw a farmer with a plow yoked to a mule, manually plowing the soil with equipment that Iberian farmers have used for a thousand years. I could barely believe my eyes.
Our goal is to reach Barcelona, and we don't mind leaving on the earliest train out of Lisboa Oriente. And in all of our scenarios we will select the fastest services available.
That will be the 07:39 AM Intercidades (IC) departing from Lisboa's Oriente station. Oriente is a lovely station that's easy to navigate and can be reached from the Lisbon Metro's red line. The IC ride from Oriente to Entroncamento is the shortest leg of the entire journey, clocking in at a little under an hour and placing you there by 08:30 AM assuming everything goes right (it often does not on Comboio Portugal).
Here you have a few moments to top off snacks and water and locate your train to Badajoz. The Entroncamento station is pretty spartan and has limited facilities, so it's really best to get anything you'll need for the entire stretch to Badajoz before you leave Oriente.
In Entroncamento, you switch trains onto the slow-rolling and frequently-stopping Regional service departing at 09:06 AM. This train has two cars and unassigned bench seating. It's far from comfortable and at 3 hours it can be a test of patience.
By the time you roll into Badajoz at 12:54 PM you will have lost an hour crossing the Spanish border.
You will also need to find some way to occupy several hours, as the next train departing for Madrid is at 05:43 PM on Renfe's Alvia service.
Here is where a key decision emerges on your trip from Lisbon to Barcelona — spend a long evening and night in Badajoz, waking the next morning to catch the first train to Madrid at 08:16 AM, or continue on to Madrid, arriving at 10:39 PM, where you will spend the night and have many options for reaching Barcelona the following day. Your choice basically comes down to: where would I rather sleep?
The good news, I suppose, is that 10:39 PM is a perfectly acceptable time to find a meal in Spain, where dinners often do not begin until 9:00 PM or later. But if you are already tired, Badajoz seems to have plenty to offer and — at least as far as I can tell — would not be a bad place to spend the night. And spending the night here would certainly allow you to eventually roll into Barcelona a little earlier in the day.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is a little under 5 hours whether you take the 08:16 AM or the 05:43 PM, but it is comfortable, with the Alvia offering assigned seats and both 1st and 2nd class carriages. There is a well-equipped cafeteria car and frequent trips up and down the aisles by the food cart.
Assuming that you decided to spend the night in Badajoz and take the 08:16 AM Alvia the following morning, you would arrive in Madrid a little past noon, and would then have many options for traveling on to Barcelona. All of them can be on Renfe's AVE high speed rail service, which was slightly nicer than the Alvia service and comparable to Comboio Portugal's Alfa Pendular high speed service.
This is the route I actually took a few weeks back. It was long — and I made the trip hung over from a night of drinking with colleagues in Barcelona — but it got me home.
As with the trip originating in Lisbon, we want to get as far as possible in a given day, so we don't mind leaving early. During my trip a few weeks ago, I intentionally chose a later train as I knew the earliest train out — at 5:50 AM — would be too early for me, and as we'll see in a moment, sacrificing sleep to get out as early as possible is not going to do anything for getting home faster when going west.
The AVE service is nice and fast, with comfortable seats that you can select in first and second class. I bought a first class seat because I wanted to be as comfortable as possible with a belly full of last night's cocktails — not that it helped much as the train jostled from side-to-side as it chugged slowly out of the ancient Catalonian principality.
The countryside here looks a lot different than it does coming from the west, but during this time of the year it was beautiful. Fruit orchards (I couldn't tell if they were cherries, plums, peaches, or some other variety of stone fruit blossoms) were in full bloom, creating rows of pink and white blossoms that striped the countryside all the way to Madrid.
The AVE service should drop you in Madrid at a very respectable 9:10 AM. But the problem is that on most days, there are only two trains departing Madrid for Badajoz: 8:30 AM and 4:17PM. And you've already missed one of them.
So you must again ask yourself where you'd prefer to spend the night.
Even though it feels like you haven't made it very far, there's a strong case to be made for spending an evening in Madrid vs. Badajoz. Madrid is a major city with many restaurants and attractions that can be used to blow your time. It's almost worth it just to exit the train station here so you can see the beautiful edificio of Madrid's Puerta de Atocha railway station. But there are also museums, parks, the botanical gardens, and more just a short distance from the station.
I chose to spend the night in Madrid and got a small room near the train station so that I could pull out on the first train to Badajoz the next morning. Given the hangover, I did not do any sightseeing. But you're smarter than me and won't have that particular problem. Right? I did eat some of the worst croquettes I've ever had that night.
Sorry Spain — Portugal's are just better.
That first train leaves at 8:30 AM, and at least for me, navigating the train station was a little confusing, so I suggest leaving yourself enough time to figure out how to get to the right train. The arrival and departure terminals are in separate buildings, so make sure you go to the right one.
The Alvia train to Badajoz is fine, with all of the amenities you need to be comfortable, but with slightly less-comfortable seats than the AVE even in first class. It speeds along just south of Spain's Sierra de Gredos mountains. With their snow-capped peaks, they make for a gorgeous backdrop to the aforementioned cow pastures and cork trees. It's a little like Texas hill country, but with some very serious hills.
By the time you reach Badajoz at 1:34 PM in the afternoon you will have made a 5 hour haul across the Iberian peninsula, but it places you in Badajoz with enough time to catch the trains on to Lisbon, where you will pick up an hour as you cross the border.
The first train to Portugal departs at 2:09 PM in the afternoon, so you have a bit of time to get snacks and water before moving on. If you miss it, there's another train to Lisboa Oriente station at 7:41 PM, but it obviously puts you in Lisbon much later at night (after 10:00 PM). This may not matter as much for a tourist, but as I was eager to get home to my family, my calculations were always focused on getting home as early in the day as possible.
Both services require taking the slow moving Regional service to Entroncamento — the reverse of what I described in the first westward-bound trip — and switch to an Intercidades service for the final leg of the journey to Lisbon's Oriente Station.
The Regional service to Entroncamento sits on an inconspicuous track that's on the perimeter of the main platforms. It's clearly labeled as a Comboio Portugal train, and when we arrived I assumed it was the train I needed to board. But we were made to enter the terminal anyway, and not permitted to re-enter the platform until its scheduled departure.
The Regional service to Entroncamento also departed late, but the conductor mostly made up the time during the trip. It was interesting to observe the people getting on and off along this route. Many of its stops were extremely rural, and I saw a mixture of different commuters: cyclists fully-decked in their cycling gear who brought bicycles aboard and got off after a few stops, grannies with grocery bags in either hands who rode the train for just one stop, and younger folks who looked like they were taking the full ride for a weekend of partying in Lisbon. Sometimes the conductor stepped out to help the older passengers on or off the train with their grocery bags or boxes, and it was easy to imagine that this cast of regulars were people he knew well and saw multiple times a week.
We arrived about 10 minutes late and discovered that CP had held the outbound train to Lisbon, allowing us to board and make the 4:52 PM arrival time in Lisbon.
This was much to the current passengers' consternation, but much to my relief and gratitude.
While I'm glad I made the cross-peninsular trip by train, it's not something I would want to do regularly. Nor, perhaps, would I want to do it with a large family and lots of luggage in tow.
But if you have a few days to burn and nowhere better to be, and you don't mind a slow moving tour of the Iberian countryside, this is an excellent option.
I should point out that overall the cost of the trip was actually comparable to a round-trip airline ticket. The Portuguese leg of the trip comes out to about €25 one way. The leg between Portugal and Madrid is another €45. And a first class ticket on the AVE between Madrid and Barcelona, in either direction, comes out to about €119. This is all in one direction.
If cost is your limiting factor — and especially travel time — air travel makes more sense.
But there are plenty of good reasons to take the train if you can: reduced environmental impact, the ability to get up and walk around to stretch your legs and take in views, choices for food and drink in the cafeteria cars, and beautiful views of the countryside are all compelling reasons to consider travel-by-train. And while the trains (at least in Spain) require you to run your bags through a screening process, it was nothing compared to the headache that is air travel in the year 2025.
I'd like to see more options for getting places by rail, so I try to take the trains whenever it's feasible. My hope is that the more we use trains, the more countries see the demand for expanded routes and increased optimization in existing routes.
While I might not take this route frequently, I'm at least comfortable in the implications that it brings and can pack and plan accordingly. And if you believe the hype, plans are in the works to bring high speed service between Lisbon and Madrid. If accomplished, this would result in something like 3 hours of travel time between the peninsula's capitals and would make getting on to Barcelona in a day an easy feat.
But I'm afraid the Portuguese cynicism for major works like this has already worn me down, and I'm not expecting this to be the case any time soon.
Even if I don't plan on going from coast to coast, I know I can make it from capital to capital in a single day, and that's a thing I might try to do more often now that I've done it once.
And maybe at some point, I'll make the cross-peninsula trek and just keep going — into France and the heart of Europe. But that's a feat for someone with way more time on their hands than me right now.

Lisbon is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and Portugal’s main centre of education, economy and culture. Its picturesque alleys of Bairro Alto and the fancy boulevards from Rossio to Tejo are just a fraction of places to go and see during the day. And by night, you’ll hear traditional Fado tunes coming out of every bar, inviting you to join the vibrant nightlife. Lisbon’s atmosphere is overall an exciting mix of fast-paced city life and Mediterranean flair that provides the needed balance between work and life.
But when you go off the usual streets and places full of tourists, you may experience a whole different side of Lisbon, one that isn’t mentioned in any common guide and for outsiders quite difficult to access. Without knowing the right places beforehand, it’s practically invisible. I talk about Lisbon’s rising underground scene of secret Chinese restaurants.
“You probably mean the „illegal“ Chinese. There are three of them close to Martim Moniz. One at the end of the street Beco da Oliveira and two are in a building in street Rua do Terreirinho (number 40 if I remember correctly).” — Henning, Erasmus Student from Lisbon on Hubble
The most prominent spot for such restaurants is around the metro station Martim Moniz in the neighborhood of Mouraria. They are often hidden in apartment buildings and back alleys, and the more you proceed into the side streets of Mouraria, the creepier it gets.
“I’m not pretty sure about the name of the restaurant but I think it is Chinês Clandestino. As the name says, it is a clandestine restaurant, so it’s like a secret spot to have a nice meal. Here you have the address: Mouraria — Rua da Guia, 9, 2 Dto, Mouraria, Lisboa. Have fun!” — Daniela, World Citizen on Hubble
The friendly and colorful Lisbon you once knew (well, a few minutes ago) is gone. Streets are plastered with garbage instead of the azure blue Azulejo tiles. Now, heated discussions in all kinds of languages come in place of the relaxing, traditional melodies from the Old Town. You would love nothing more than to turn around, hop onto the metro back to Bairro Alto and quickly forget about your unsuccessful adventure, but the goal is already within your reach. You can’t go back now, can you?
“There are two in Rua do Benformoso 59. Just knock on the door on the 1st floor or try the one on the 2nd floor.” — Nanxi, Foodie on Hubble
You wind up standing in front of a slightly rundown house. The door is open most of the time and leads to a dark hallway. It feels like you’re in a movie…No, not the one’s with a happy ending. You dare to go upstairs. The smell of food fills your nose but the fear of getting kidnapped and waking up tomorrow without a kidney is the only thing you can think of.
Nervously, you read the number of the apartment where you have to go from a little, crumpled-up piece of paper which you got from your Airbnb host. It’s the right place. You gather all your courage and knock on the door. You regret it, why did you even come here, you should have gone to McDonal — … Suddenly, an old, Asian lady opens the door and invites you warmly in. Although you don’t understand a word, it feels like everyone is very kind to you. Maybe this isn’t so bad at all. At least your organs are safe.
In the restaurant, it’s a completely different world. A bit modest, but clean, traditional and cozy. A few people are having dinner, others play ancient board games. The old lady sits down and continues to watch a TV show while you proceed to one of the 8 tables in total. There’s no pressure. You sit down, choose a meal and after all the stress you get rewarded with incredible amounts of tasty food at a good price. Regular restaurants have nothing on the unmatched dishes and familiar vibe. It’s like you would eat at your grandparent’s home, well if your grandparents should be from Asia and… I mean you get it.
I can’t recommend those places enough. Instead of going to the same locations over and over again, you should try one of these secret restaurants. It’s an exciting part of everyday life in Lisbon and when you want to see its true nature while having a cheap night-out, this is it!

Lisbon’s Quiosques Helped Me Rediscover Backgammon,https://medium.com/portugal-calling/lisbons-quiosques-helped-me-rediscover-backgammon-96b569844156,"Sign up

Like most children, when I was very little, there were things in our house that I was not allowed to touch. Things like the grandfather clock in our living room, which I was told would fall over on me. Or the record player, which I actually did touch, and did break the stylus on, and which never worked again. And of course common dangerous kitchen things like the stove, oven, or kitchen knives.
But of all the things I was not allowed to touch, the weirdest and seemingly most harmless one was a small, gray, leather-bound case that my mom kept in her room. It was about the same size as one of our encyclopedias, but thinner, and had a handle for carrying. The brass latches kept both sides of the case firmly closed. At the time, it felt like the perfect child-sized suitcase for pretending I was going on a trip somewhere. “Aloha! I’m off to Hawaii with my cool little suitcase!”, I might’ve pretended. Except that I definitely was not allowed to use this little case as a prop.
But within this tantalizing little case was something special to my mom. Something she worried I would either damage, or lose the pieces to, or spill something on, or maybe she just thought I’d swallow a piece. It was a backgammon board; a game my mom would later reveal to me in the hopes of having a partner for playing. But she would be disappointed, as it turned out, because backgammon is kind of confusing for a kid.
While we tried to play a few times, most of our games ended in mutual frustration, and for the time being I decided backgammon was boring and not something I wanted to learn to play.
The trajectory of gaming for me was not a straight line from my first encounter with backgammon to rediscovering it decades later. As a kid I played a lot of the basic Milton Bradley and Parker Bros. stuff — Monopoly, Trouble, Guess Who, Clue — and as I entered my junior high years I began playing tabletop role playing games. During weekends in high school, I would go to a tennis meet, then head to a friend’s house at Fort Polk where half of our team would engage in UNO or Risk and the occasional groan-inducing session of Axis and Allies.
It wasn’t until I was in early college, and I met my friend Lyle, that I got into what were then called “European-style board games”: Ticket to Ride, Puerto Rico, Game of Thrones, and more. The vast world of tabletop gaming — with its myriad choices of engines, strategies, settings, and pleasant little game pieces — opened up to me and hooked me. It was revelatory.
After I got married in 2010, I introduced my wife to the world of adult board games, and she got into them as well. By 2012, we were hosting weekly game nights at our house in Atlanta. My wife would prepare a delicious meal for everyone, and we’d kick things off with a warmup game like Citadels, Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards (we lovingly call this game Wizards of Skullfuck Mountain because none of us could be bothered to remember the name), or something else that played quickly. Then we’d eat, and get into the real main course — a good multiplayer board game— which might last for 2–3 hours.
This went on for many years until the complications of life finally intruded on everyone, and we had a kid.
Around the same time in 2012, I was being introduced to the ancient Asian strategy game of Go by a coworker. I was fascinated by the simplicity of the game, but continuously challenged by its complex strategies. At this point I was mostly dabbling — we’d play a few games on a mobile app each week, but eventually I changed jobs, we lost touch, and I didn’t think about Go for a while.
Then in 2014, I got an itch to play Go again, and got a physical Go board and pieces and brought them to work. I sat it on my desk and friends and I would take turns playing throughout the day. One day an outside consultant I had hired walked by my desk and noticed our Go board and revealed that he was deeply into Shogi and Go. This let to a renewed interest in Go for myself, and an introduction to the intricacies and deep strategies of Go for some of my coworkers. While some of them got deeply into it (one of them is now the head of Atlanta’s Go Club and a highly-ranked player), I played occasionally but did not invest a lot of time in practicing. Consequently, I am not very good at Go but I still love the game.
Fast forward to 2024. I still love games. And our daughter does too. Among her favorites are Splendor, Azul, Ghost Blitz, and chess. A lot of my free time in Lisbon is spent sitting at the park quiosque reading, writing, and drinking a cold beer on a nice day. While the kid runs circles around the quiosque with her friends climbing trees and playing tag, my wife and I sit at the quiosque’s small tables making small talk, looking at our phones, or planning out the week’s activities. Sometimes friends join us, and when they do there is plenty of good conversation to keep our brains occupied. But when it's just us, it's nice to have something to do beyond just chatting.
This got me thinking about small games to occupy ourselves. It's not unusual to see people playing cards, but I don't love the way cards occupy your hands, and I honestly don't really enjoy most of the two-player card games. I thought about Go, but I have consistently failed to get my wife interested in Go, and with its hundreds of small pieces, it could make for a real mess if the kit came open accidentally or a pigeon decided that one of the pieces looked particularly tasty. Then I thought about dice, but I don't know any simple games involving dice.
But then a thought entered my mind: what about backgammon?
Backgammon has its own portable case and is available in very small form-factors.
Backgammon is for two players.
Backgammon has limited pieces to lose.
Backgammon has a relaxed pace, and allows your hands to be free to smoke or drink.
But what I couldn't remember is anything about playing it, so I started doing some reading and watching some videos and realized that backgammon was actually pretty easy to learn, but that there was ample room for strategy. Things clicked and finally fell into place for me, and I thought that I'd like to order a small backgammon set to try.
I found what appeared to be a nice, travel-sized set on Amazon Espanha: a travel set from Yellow Mountain. As we had a trip coming up to Alcaide for the Festa de Cogumelos, I knew my wife and I would have an opportunity to play for a few days: during our time relaxing at the hotel.
For two people on the move wanting to learn to play, it was a good set. The Yellow Mountain set is probably overpriced, but it’s nice for anyone looking for a travel-sized board. When fully opened it lays flat on a table, has a felt game board, and the checkers are magnetized, making it easier to keep up with them. It comes with a set of backgammon rules. My only real complaint is that the miniature dice feel cheap, and that the magnetized checkers sometimes make them hard to stack.
After our arrival at the hotel, we sat in the lounge and played for several hours while we had drinks and snacks. I explained the basics of the game to my wife and she quickly caught on.
Since then, we’ve played hours of backgammon while we're at the quiosque, but we have also started playing more at home. We are having a great time challenging each other and figuring things out for ourselves. It’s so nice to have an interesting, casual game to play while we hang out at the quiosque. I’m looking forward to having it this coming spring and summer.
And there's a lot of strategy that we have yet to discover. We didn't begin using the doubling cube — a dice that effectively lets both players bet on the outcome of the game in order to win more points — though we eventually added it into play and have slowly started to increase the number of points needed to win a game (we're up to 9 points now). But the doubling cube absolutely adds another element of strategy to the game.
Neither of us has yet to score a gammon or backgammon, which occurs when one player manages to ""bear off"" all of their pieces out of their home board before the other player has a single piece in. Most of our games wind up being very close, and I'm confident there are strategies we are overlooking for blocking each other from scoring. The defining moment of each game is always when one of us gets our last piece past the last opponent on the board, at which time it becomes a race to bear off all of our pieces.
For Christmas, my wife bought me a nice, handmade home board from a Greek company called Manopoulos — it's gorgeous and the pieces and game board are so satisfying to hold and touch! It's too big for the quiosque, but that's okay. It's a wonderful board to use at home and we look for any opportunity to pull it out and play a few rounds. It’s something that will be in our family for years.
And you know what? I’ll probably let my daughter touch it, though thus far she has shown little interest in backgammon after watching us play many rounds.
I’m glad I remembered that little suitcase from my childhood, and that my mom at least tried teaching me a game that — although I didn’t find interesting at the time — I would remember later in life. It at least made backgammon a possibility in my mind and made it an option to consider when I was looking for a casual, portable, strategic, two-player boardgame.
I think my mom would be happy to know that I rediscovered backgammon and learned how to play. And I'm glad I did! The gameplay is the perfect pace for nice days at the quiosque.
And when she eventually returns to Lisbon for a visit, I look forward to surprising her with my knowledge of backgammon, and playing a few games with her at the quiosque over a cold beer.

21st August 2013 Lisbon, Portugal
The ship’s engine whirled, shook and rattled to a stop as outside, the crew scuttled about to pull thick ropes around the metal structures on Lisbon’s port to hold the cruise ship in place for the day. The sun’s rays enveloped the entire city from the top of the mountains, over brightly-coloured houses all in pastel, before reaching over one magnificent church standing tall at sea level.
“Lisbon was a city full of history and culture. Many buildings and markets were kept as it was a hundred years before, portraying the old ways of life.”
We went ashore after having breakfasted on the ship and rode a century-old tram around different city quarters, with assurance from the driver that this tram line was used as regular transportation in the city.
The tram climbed up steep hills and slid down narrow alleyways as if following a secret passageway that only our driver knew of. We passed the old quarter with houses worn down and looking like slums, but still had beautiful glazed tiles in their façade that were used immensely as decoration in the olden days, giving blue, green, turquoise and red patterns to entire buildings, making them stand out from their plain, pastel-coloured neighbours.
As the tram rattled past the main train station, it occurred to me why the architecture looked a little bit like home. Coming from Thailand, I was familiar with the fact that Portuguese culture influenced a lot of Thai culture during the time of King Rama V (in the 19th century), where the King had commissioned Portuguese architects to design many buildings during the time of his reign. One of the locals explained that the king of Thailand indeed came to visit Lisbon once, meeting the King of Portugal in the very same train station that our tram moved past.
We reached a huge open square surrounded by magnificent white columns of the city’s biggest theatre, the monument of King John of Lisbon atop a horse, as well as the palace walls that ran along the length of the square. The tram stopped long enough for all of us to have a glass of port wine and a Portuguese egg tart (pastéis de nata).
“Port was traditionally drank after a meal in Portugal, a habit taken up by the British people, but twisted by the French: they enjoyed their glass of the sweet red port as an aperitif before meals.”
This Portuguese pastry was also familiar to us Thais — creamy egg tart with a consistency similar to that of crème brulée, encased in a crispy, flaked pastry shell sold at the side of the roads. But the Portuguese version has a touch of cinnamon, which gave the tart a special and more complex aroma and flavour. The combination of freshly made, warm egg tart and cool, smooth port is thoroughly enjoyed in Portugal as a breakfast pastry or mid-afternoon snack with coffee.
One of the most famous places to try these gloriously crunchy, buttery tarts in Lisbon is at Pastéis de Belém
A café stood in the corner of the square, where one of the locals pointed out to us that it has been operating there since the 1700s. It was mid-morning, but the café was packed with customers having coffee and a golden, thread-like dessert called Fios de Ovos . Another familiar sight, this dessert is thought by many to originate from Thailand and called Foi-Thong (golden thread), however it was the Portuguese that first made it.
The dessert was another Portuguese delicacy which was shared by many far Eastern cultures when the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, sailed across the Indian Ocean and created a new trade route in the 15th century.
The tram started up again, winding its way down to a huge moastery that stood close to the harbourside, its walls running 500 metres across the gardens in front, close to the sea. If you came to Lisbon, this was a must-see sight as the monastery was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Inside the dome-like structure which loomed high above us, were altars of Jesus Christ and tombs of the king and queen. The main altar was of European influence, with paintings of the Lord, Mother Mary from the Renaissance period, but the tombs of the long-gone royals were supported by Indian elephants, showing further the fascination with Oriental cultures the king of Portugal at the time had. Inside this church also lay the tomb of the explorer Vasco da Gama.
Lisbon is a big city and half a day of exploring was simply not enough.

Situated in one of the most beautiful squares of the world, the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio, most commonly known as Rua Augusta Arch, is the monumental gate that connects Lisbon to Tagus river.
The construction process of this Triumphal Arch, the emblematic finishing element of the buildings that constitute the former Terreiro do Paço, was long and certainly not controversy-free.
Supported by grandiose columns it is topped by a set of sculptures that carries a lot of meaning.
Today it is one of the tourist attractions of the city and a must-visit place for the Portuguese as well as for foreigners, as it provides a stunning 360-degree view over the river and the Pombaline Downtown.
After the devastating earthquake of 1755, it was necessary to rebuild the entire downtown area of the city. For that a team of engineers and architects was formed and was led by minister Marquis of Pombal that under the rules of the Reformist Enlightenment movement created a new modern, rational city with a classic and simple style, the Pombaline Style.
The monumental Praça do Comércio was built over the former Terreiro do Paço. The royal palace that used to exist there since the 16th century and that collapsed was solely symbolically replaced by the equestrian statue of King José I.
The square, composed by buildings with arcades, is perfectly symmetric and has two towers both on the east and west sides, while the south side faces the river and the north side faces the new city. The Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio, the noble entrance of Lisbon, was projected for the north end since the beginning.
The first project, by Eugénio dos Santos, was classic and simple and was approved in 1758. It was a round arch sided by statues in niches, with a triangular pediment and topped by a sculpture set.
In 1762 the architect passed away and was substituted by Carlos Mardel who presented a new proposal. More connected to a baroque model, this proposal replaces the pediment with a tall bell tower and a clock, decorated with pinnacles and flame-shaped sculptural ornaments.
Just like the previous one, this project long awaited its execution, seeing that the economic resources of the kingdom were being destined to more important works.
With time passing by, the political context as well as people’s tastes changed and new ideas arose, which triggered a heated discussion among the people of Lisbon.
Thus, the execution of the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio was successively delayed. First due to the withdrawal of Marquis of Pombal from the government in 1777 and later due to the political and economical instability that resulted from the civil war in the early 1800s.
However, in 1815 the support columns were built and only in 1873 was finally inaugurated the monument projected by Veríssimo José da Costa, a solution that merges the best of the two previous proposals.
From Eugénios dos Santos he chose to include the sculpture sets, as well as the classic lines and balanced proportions; from Carlos Mardel he included the clock and placed it facing north, while the south side features the coat of arms of Portugal. Plus, he added a baroque style with the rococo decoration that surrounds them.
Veríssimo José da Costa kept the already built base but discarded the triangular pediment from the two previous projects, replacing it with a rectangular structure that corresponds to a wide hall, where we can see the clock mechanism, as well as a superb view from both the large lateral windows.
The sculptures present in the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio resulted from an iconographic programme from the French artist Célestin Anatole Calmels (1822–1906). This artist executed, among others, the emblematic works of the Allegories on the sides of the portal of Palmela Palace and the sculpture set of the pediment of the City Council of Lisbon.
On the south side of the arch, the artwork on the top level was executed by the Portuguese romantic sculptor Victor Bastos (1830–1894), author of, among other pieces, the monument of tribute to the poet Luís de Camões, situated in the Square named after him.
They are the colossal allegories of the rivers Tagus (west side) and Douro (east side) on the sides of the building; and two pairs of statues that represent four important figures of the History of Portugal.
While the representations of these same rivers in the statues of Liberdade Avenue are harder to distinguish, here they’re more clearly identified. The statue on the east side features a bunch of grapes, which we immediately associate to the Demarcated Region of Douro, instituted in 1756 during the governance of Pombal. On the opposite side the Tagus seems to have had an object on its hand, but whatever it was is now broken.
When it comes to the statues, from left to right we can find: on the west side, Viriathus (181 BC-139 BC), the mythical leader of Lusitanian people, followed by Vasco da Gama (1469–1524), the navigator and explorer that discovered the sea route from Europe to the East.
On the east side, from left to right we can see Marquis of Pombal (1699–1782), who was responsible for the development of the country and for the reconstruction of the capital. A figure that certainly wouldn’t have had a place here if the arch hadn’t been built so belatedly. Finally we see Constable Nuno Álvares Pereira (1360–1431), an equally important personality of the History of Portugal and Lisbon and founder of the Carmo Convent.
Four personalities from different times and of distinct qualities but all certainly related to the allegories on the top of the arch: Valour and Genius crowned by Glory.
This last stone sculpture set presents us three figures: the middle one is standing and represents Glory, who is holding two bronze bay crowns on top of the head of two seated figures next to her.
Below them we can see the inscription: “VIRTVTIBVS MAIORUM VT SIT OMNIBVS DOCMENTO. P.(ECVNIA) P.(VBLICA) D.(ATVM)”, which means: By virtue of the Greatest, so that it may serve everyone as a teaching. Dedicated to public expenditure. ”
On the west side we can see the female figure of the goddess Minerva wearing a plume helmet and holding a sword, with a lion resting by her side. On the two sides of the helmet are presented two small winged dragons, which remind us of the symbol of the House of Aviz.
The roman goddess Minerva, associated with the greek Athena, is the goddess of wisdom, strategic warfare and the sponsor of arts, hence being connected to Valour.
Genius is here represented on the east side by the god Apollo with books and a lyre. In this case the beardless young figure has wings, which connects it to the Christian figure of the Archangel Michael.
On top of one of its wings there’s a discreet small figure of a philosopher that we hypothetically associate to the roman writer of the 1st century BC Virgil.
The symbology of the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio, the Equestrian Statue of King José I, the Cais das Colunas and even the dimensions and proportion of the Square and of the buildings that constitute it, have been targets of interpretations that tend to emphasise its masonic and esoteric character. We leave these reflections to the specialists.
To finish off, we must suggest you visit the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio that has been open to the public since 2013. You can access it in Rua Augusta by going on an elevator and then going up a few stairs. You’ll have access to a terrace where you can admire the stunning view.

You know what they say, right? It is very easy to come to Lisboa, but to leave this city is very hard. In the next few months, you will spend in this ‘ ‘, you will find out that this could not be more true. To get familiar with the place you can call home for your Erasmus semester, Cidade Linda here are some of the highlights you can — and should — not miss.
You probably noticed them in your new neighbourhood: These small restaurants or local cafés can be found throughout the city. Start your day by ordering a strong ‘ bica’ and a pastel de nata. You cannot leave Lisboa without trying this combination out and, chances are high it will even become your daily routine!
Besides supporting your local pastelaria, check out Manteigaria as well. There are two: one in Rua do Loreto and one in Lisboa’s Time Out Market. This food market is also great for getting a bite or a drink during the day or evening.
When you are done exploring the city and head out to Belém, the place not to miss for the best pastéis de Nata (this is plural of ‘ pastel de nata ‘ by the way, which is good to know in case you want to order more than one) is Pastéis de Belém. Easy to recognise because people line up in the street, but it’s worth the wait. Trust me!
On a Tuesday or Saturday, take a stroll through. Feira da Ladra is a secondhand market, up in the area between the Graça and Alfama neighbourhoods and is a must-see as well. It is a great place to go treasure hunting and find a truly special souvenir to bring home: uniquely illustrated postcards, plates with a 70’s design, but also vintage shoes or old leather bags. Enjoy a walk back to the city centre from here, and you will notice why they say Lisboa is built on seven hills right away.
One of the best places in town to get a drink with a view is Park Rooftop. When you haven’t been there before, it can seem a bit strange to enter a random parking garage for a drink. But, just take the elevator all the way up and you are at the rooftop bar. It can be hard to get a table but try going during the day and enjoy the view on the Ponte 25 de Abril. This place is also nicest views over the city must be highly recommended when the sun sets or for parties at night.
There is a lot to see and do in the city of course, but when the temperatures rise — and believe me, they will — check out the beaches nearby. Easy to reach by train are those of Carcavelos, Estoril and Cascais. Another great one is Costa da Caparica, on the other side of the Tejo river. Take the bus from Praça da Espanha and you can be in the ocean just forty minutes later. Perfect, right? And, since you are there, you might as well try a surf lesson.
A night out in Lisboa starts here. Meet your friends at the nearby Praça Luís de Camões and head into one of the small streets to buy a cheap drink at one of the bars. From here, you can easily walk down, towards the river, to the Cais do Sodré area later that night. Here, the bars and clubs can be found in Pink Street. Not the official name, but the asphalt is actually painted pink. Try some of the streets around it as well, just follow the crowd and enjoy your drink out on the streets!
Another thing not to miss is LxFactory. Try to go on a Saturday and have a look at the market at this former threads and fabrics factory, but any other day is nice as well to go here for a drink, lunch, brunch and do some shopping. Oh, and you should definitely check out Livraria Ler Devagar, an amazing there. Hundreds of books cover the walls — both, new and second-hand — which make space not only nice to see in real life but definitely Instagram-worthy as well.
Check out the concerts and other festivals that LX Factory organises, there’s always something going on. they organise at LX Factory too, there are some cool events going on.
Just follow these six tips, and you will slowly become more of a local in your new city. In the next few months, you will undoubtedly have tons of tips to add to the list and understand even more why you can never really leave Lisboa.
Truth is, moving to a new place shouldn’t be stressful. Book a new home online with Uniplaces.

“Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life.” ― Fernando Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet
Lisbon, the city that illuminates history and culture, has been the soul city of some great writers. After years of traveling vicariously in and around Lisbon through José Saramago’s novels, I was finally there!
My first visual of Lisbon was through Saramago’s tour de force, ‘The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis’ —
“The sea ends, and the earth begins. It is raining over the colorless city. The waters of the river are polluted with mud, the riverbanks flooded. A dark vessel, the Highland Brigade, ascends the somber river and is about to anchor at the quay of Alcântara.”
The eponymous protagonist, Ricardo Reis, one of the many heteronyms of the modernist poet Fernando Pessoa, returns to Lisbon amidst political turmoil in 1935 after 16 years of exile in Brazil. Ricardo Reis strolls around Lisbon’s boulevards and narrow streets, observing the changes that…

I’ve learned that big cities are a hassle no matter where in the world you travel. If you have a rental car, driving in European urban centers is incredibly stressful. That’s why I chose to ride the bus into Lisbon and let someone else deal with traffic.
My base in Óbidos offered a simple solution. A comfortable bus picked me up less than a five minute walk from my Airbnb and dropped me off in Lisbon city center one hour later for $8. Best deal of the trip I’d say.
One of the first things you learn about Lisbon is that the city you see today is relatively new (by European standards). On November 1, 1755, a powerful earthquake leveled much of Portugal’s capital. An ensuing tsunami and fire increased the devastation. More than 35,000 people died. At the time, Lisbon was one of the largest cities in Europe.
Ruins of the Carmo Convent in central Lisbon were preserved as a memorial to the earthquake. Today the site appropriately serves as an archaeological museum. Stone arches inside rose to an open sky, providing silent testaments to the day Lisbon crumbled.
Legend has it that Lisbon, similar to Rome, was founded on seven hills. There were incredible views out over the city from the top of each hill but you had a workout hiking up and down each one.
I found that Lisbon was an interesting mix of modern and an almost whimsical past. Rickety trams clicked and clacked their way up the hills as electric cars whirred by.
It was a great city to just wander rather than trying to hit a list of major sights. You were bound to get lost anyway in the winding streets of the old town. Rare for Europe, the city’s commercial center actually had a grid-like street plan built after the earthquake.
I’d compare Lisbon to San Francisco in the States. Both cities are on the ocean, have hills and trams. Both suffered devastating earthquakes. Lisbon even had a suspension bridge spanning its bay that resembled the Golden Gate.
I peeked inside this store for Portugal’s national football (not soccer) team. Led by star Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal is still alive in the current World Cup. When the team is playing, life pretty much comes to a standstill here, with everyone gathering around their TVs. Portugal’s historical rivals include Brazil, Spain and France.
I jumped on a local train to go a few minutes down the coast for a visit to the Belém neighborhood in western Lisbon. A massive monument to Portuguese explorers was built there as a nod to its place as the point where ships departed Lisbon.
Belém also housed Jerónimos Monastery, erected in the early 1500s near the launch point of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama’s first journey. Da Gama became the first European to reach India by sea after he sailed around the south of Africa at the Cape of Good Hope. His remains were interred in a prominent carved tomb in the nave of the monastery’s church.
Da Gama’s discovery and the subsequent Portuguese armadas that sailed to India for spices helped build the small country into a serious world power in the 1500s.
So much of Portugal’s history and culture, its national identity really, stem from the Age of Discovery.

Curiosities:
Did you know that Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in Western Europe, predating other European capitals such as Paris and Rome? Its history dates back over 3,000 years, making it a living testament to the passage of time and the resilience of its people.
Climate and Best Time to Visit:
Lisbon enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and warm summers. The best time to visit is during the spring (April to June) and autumn (September to October) when the weather is pleasantly mild, and the city is adorned with blooming flowers and lush greenery. Summer (July to August) is also a popular time to visit, despite the warmer temperatures, as it coincides with festive events and lively street celebrations.

Myths and Legends:
Legend has it that Lisbon was founded by the ancient Greek hero Odysseus during his epic journey home from Troy. According to myth, Odysseus was so captivated by the beauty of Lisbon’s natural harbor that he decided to establish a city on its shores. While the origins of Lisbon may be shrouded in myth and folklore, one thing is certain — the city’s allure is as timeless as the stories that have been woven into its fabric.
Typical Phrases:
As you wander through the streets of Lisbon, you’ll often hear locals greeting each other with “Bom dia” (Good morning), “Boa tarde” (Good afternoon), or “Boa noite” (Good evening). These simple phrases reflect the warmth and friendliness of the Portuguese people, who take pride in extending a warm welcome to visitors from near and far.
Cuisine and Culture:

From savory bacalhau (salted cod) dishes to sweet pastéis de nata (custard tarts), Lisbon’s culinary scene is a feast for the senses. Be sure to sample traditional Portuguese dishes such as grilled sardines, caldo verde (kale soup), and arroz de marisco (seafood rice) at local eateries and family-owned restaurants. As you savor each bite, you’ll gain a deeper appreciation for the rich culinary heritage that defines Lisbon’s gastronomic identity.
The people of Lisbon are known for their warmth, hospitality, and love for music and dance. Fado, Portugal’s soulful musical genre, holds a special place in the hearts of Lisboetas (residents of Lisbon) and is often performed in intimate venues known as fado houses. The haunting melodies and heartfelt lyrics of fado songs capture the essence of Portuguese culture and evoke a deep sense of emotion that resonates with locals and visitors alike.
In conclusion, Lisbon is a city that invites you to embrace its history, savor its flavors, and immerse yourself in its vibrant culture. Whether you’re strolling along the cobblestone streets of the old town, admiring the intricate azulejos (ceramic tiles) that adorn buildings, or simply sipping a glass of port wine while gazing at the sunset over the river, Lisbon will leave an indelible impression on your heart.

Traveling abroad can seem daunting, overwhelming, and complex on the surface, with so much to worry about what can go wrong. But traveling embraces our commonality with other people, and traveling can be simple and fun. This publication answers the question of: What can go right?

Long before cities like Paris, Munich, and London began to emerge, one Western European city stood above the rest. Known for its culture, elegance, and community, this city was developed on seven hills surrounding the beautiful blue-teal waters of its harbor and beyond. Known for Fado music, melancholic and soulful melodies through song illustrating histories of social marginality and transgression. And known for their Pastéis de Belém, delicious custard tarts in which the original recipe is still a mystery. Combining the benefits of sharing the same climate as San Diego while also remaining as low cost as Midwest America, this complicated, picturesque, and attitude-changing city of Lisbon, Portugal, exemplifies how geography shapes a society. Modern geologists and sociologists have fiery arguments on whether geology shapes society or whether the societies we create affect which type of geology we settle in. And while a combination of both seems to be the truth, Lisbon highlights how not only geography shapes a city but how geological events change the philosophy, community, and culture of a city and its surrounding society.
HOW GEOGRAPHY SHAPES SOCIETY

A hidden gem in the western end of the European continent: This is Lisbon, a city full of beauty and poetry.
Located over seven hills alongside the Tejo river, Lisbon is attracting tourists, college students, and residents from all places.
The city is one of the oldest cities in the world and was first named Olissipo, founded by the Greek hero Ulysses after the Trojan War, according to an old legend. Lisbon’s streets of cobblestone, ancient ruins, and beautiful cathedrals transport the traveler through a thousand years of history, wars, and conquest.
Today Lisbon is flourishing with culture, music, restaurants, and concerts, mixed with nice weather and affordable prices. Visiting Lisbon, try their delicious fish and seafood cuisine. In June, sardines are grilled on barbecues on every street in celebration of the St. John’s bonfire festival.
Hop up for an adventure going to Belem Tower on a tram ride, and don’t forget to eat the delicious Belem Pastries. As the country’s capital, Lisbon holds worldwide cuisines reflecting its residents’ countries of origin. Great places to eat are the…

The last time I was in Europe was in 2019 when I went to Web Summit Lisbon: the world’s largest tech conference.
I have the chance to be back in Europe this summer, funnily enough, in Lisbon again.
Turns out I really like coming back to places. I’ve got to reflect on the (massive) personality changes I’ve had since 2019… as well as the things that really haven’t changed (spoiler: I still get really loud when I am enthusiastic. And I have a very low bar for things that make me enthusiastic… things within life are just SO worth raving about).
My recollection of Lisbon in 2019 was entirely fantastical. I didn’t have one bad thing in my memory… I even forgot about all those stairs. Youthful bliss.
Adulthood comes with new features: some are good (wine at lunch) and some are not so good (an adult culture of complaining). This second time in Lisbon has me reflecting on my sense of adventure and open-mindedness from before. While places do have their downsides, overall, I think the big picture of life is generally quite positive; it’s something that adults lose track of among the millions of opportunities to be negative.
For example, Lisbon has many (many!) stairs/hills, but it’s also filled with stunning view points. I could complain about the stairs or I could appreciate the sheer fact that you can see the ocean, castles and millions of portuguese roofs from the centre of Lisbon.
Anyway, this is the start to yet another ramble about how great it is to be an optimist: to see the world for all its amazingness. While this is not a complex sentiment, it can be overruled with our primitive software (i.e., our brains looking out for danger) or the primitive software of other adults looking out for danger.
Let’s remember that the commodities of the 21st century are things the wealthiest of the 19th century couldn’t even dream of buying.
I’ve used the phrase zest for life over the last few years to ground my optimism for the world. I’ll attempt to inject this zest within the 5 lessons I learned (or re-learned) after my recent last 9 days in Lisbon.
While I was walking up a huge hill towards Jardim do Torel I noticed a very peaceful grandma sitting on a bench with her feet dangling and her hands doodling. The skies were perfectly blue and she was all cozy on the cobblestone road tilted 45 degrees.
There’s something so pleasurable about watching someone pursue their life for themselves, despite other expectations or limitations from terrain.
Similarly, my friend Jake writes a great and intense newsletter about golf, and while I am the furthest thing from a golf fanatic, I love reading his newsletter. He is so passionate and unapologetically a golf nerd that it’s just refreshing. It’s cementing to see someone else pursue their interests so boldly.
I like spotting the bullet-journaling grandmas and Jakes in the world.
It’s an art to pay attention and find these gems. But, if you look close enough, you’ll see many happy people and their passions flowing through their veins.
Our brains get easily flagged down by negative, ugly or scary things. I think the world is more kind than it is mean (re: Factfulness) but our minds have a huge distortion to notice the few mean things rather than the many kind ones. But with the art of attention, you can see beyond this distortion.
I’m a big fan of spotting cute things. Cute puppies in strollers, cute families with grown children… all wearing matching bucket hats, cute cartoons on fancy menus, cute babies with fat cheeks. It’s like a renewable resource of serotonin.
I even feel happy running around Lisbon in circles. Recognising spots from last time and places I’ve walked around a bunch this time.
Attentiveness allows me to log a street I’ve walked on such that when I walk on it again, it gives me a dose of familiarity: a very popular neutron-firing-pattern for the human brain.
I try to be attentive to all the Portuguese words, to recognise sounds and phrases, let them become familiar tunes instead of being drowned by the foreignness and communication barriers.
Essentially, there’s always a positive twist on my surroundings if I’m attentive enough. I derive a lot of happiness from hunting.
I’ve noticed a lot of people phrase their wishes in the past-tense:
These “wishes” are just regrets rebranded. I think the utility of regret is its ability to learn for or reframe the future. Why not reflect on regrets briefly, and then make wishes for the future?
Have wishes that aren’t regrets but plausible ideas:
Better yet, make these wishes more specific so that they’re not just theoretical.
Other than reflection, I see no reason to wish from the past. I see no reason to hold grudges. I’d like to learn from the past & pay it forward without dwelling.
One of my lowest points during this trip was when I was really tired and made a snap judgement about someone else. It’s inexcusable and not something I do often (thankfully), but also not something I’m immune to. It was a low point because I was really disappointed in myself.
I reflected and realised that I have my snap judgments in moments of desperation or insecurity. It’s not a them problem, it’s a me problem.
eople live lives with different compasses. They might achieve things in their lives I wish I could emulate or have, but instead of looking within myself for why I don’t achieve those things, I judge them to compensate for their gains with a loss. Basically, I will lower one element of themselves to feel less jealous.
I think this is a really rotten mentality. Lessening someone else to feel more secure yourself.
I believe I should appreciate subjectivity, i.e., respecting other people’s lives to co-exist with mine. Realising my beliefs are not objective and binarily correct, enjoying my life but not at the expense of how others want to live theirs and supporting other humans without being too pushy on my agenda.
Part of this journey has been internalizing that every human has something I can learn from. Everyone. They may lead vastly different lives than me but surely I do not have it all figured out.
Philosophically, my higher mind agrees with the notion of subjectivity and respect. But my monkey-mind can uncontrollably judge when it feels in danger.
I’ve been reading Tim Urban’s book “What’s our problem” and it’s undoubtedly inspiring these reflections of higher and primitive minds. The architecture of our brain is soooo ancient while the world is sooooo new; having a deep understanding of both is vital to co-existing in them sustainably.
Ancient = hunter-gatherers running from lions. New = can use a device built in 40+ countries to connect to the world wide web to click a button to borrow a bike for 10 minutes. These are very different scenarios!
The monkey inside my brain can mistake good, kind, different people with a lion trying to eat me. It will panic, judge, run, scream and desire a banana for extra running energy. And when it turns out that the person is in fact uninterested in having me for lunch, the monkey will be embarrassed it was wrong so it will use cognitive dissonance to rationalise how the perfectly fine human was actually a lion 10 seconds ago through the magic of animal-morphing technology that obviously the monkey catalyzed to relieve the threat.
I hope that’s enough of a vivid scenario to illustrate how silly our minds can be. Hence, I am working on a three-pronged approach to combat monkey-mind judgement:
During a conversation at Bahr Bairro Alto with Ula and João, we chatted about a random person pursuing a wealthy life in the more ‘traditional’ route. We’re a group of people who thrive on the unconventional route, so it was interesting to discuss someone with similar ambition but a different approach.
I just assumed this person was pursuing wall-street… because that’s what most people I know who want to make a lot of money do. But then they were both like no: think bigger.
I didn’t know there was something bigger than wall street? Turns out there’s a category well beyond wall-street that takes more insider information. Wall Street just has a good brand. Like Gucci (known luxury) vs Zegna (less known, but more luxury) or Rolex (known luxury) vs Patek Philip (less known, but more luxury)…. It’s a luxury so luxury that it’s off the market.
I liked learning this a lot since I get such a high off of learning about less-mainstream paths and more rare experiences.
This concept of thinking beyond the ceiling is so appealing. Our conversation added a new anchor within my pursuit for an interesting and status-quo-challenging life.
I have a very Serbian dad which means after his obedient medium-sized dog comes his stick-shift 2010 car with nearly 300,000 km logged. He taught me how to drive a manual car.
However, it turns out that driving on flatland & wide Canadian roads is VERY different from hilly, 1800s cobble-stone, windy, tiny Portuguese roads!
But you know… I did it and learned a lot.
There were many miracles along the way. Like how our Peugeot managed to go 120 km/h in 5th gear without falling apart, only getting a handful of honks and successfully avoiding all instances of parallel parking (big miracle, you have no idea).
We also had not 1, not 2, not 3 but 4 Portuguese people actively get in the car, demonstrate some of their manual car life lessons & help with hill-starts or parking. 3/4 were complete strangers who stopped everything to get in the driver seat, not kidnap us, and share their wisdom. Their helpfulness was such an asset and is one of the things I’ll really remember about this trip. It’s an energy I’d like to share more in life too.
Another thing I’ve noticed in Portugal that parallels my Serbian culture is how much people like to feed each other! Contrast to Asia, portions are VERY generous. It never feels like someone is optimising their margin. While this isn’t the most business-forward, life-wise, I really enjoy the vibes of the anti-stinginess. Essentially, I don’t want to make my wealth by selling the least amount of salmon for the highest possible price.
It’s been a really beautiful time… and in what feels like another full circle, I’m off to London, the place I was supposed to go in April 2020… :)
I’m grateful for the strings of the world and for your attention… now go enjoy something around you :)

Book Review: “Two Nights in Lisbon” by Chris Pavone,https://zachary-houle.medium.com/book-review-two-nights-in-lisbon-by-chris-pavone-8717045f03c8,"Sign up

When Chris Pavone’s Two Nights in Lisbon was initially published in hardcover last May, there was a great deal of pre-release hype behind it. I got a print galley, a digital galley, and then a finished copy of the novel — which all came to me by the publisher without much prompting on my part if I’m recalling things correctly. Thus, it seemed like the publisher was particularly interested in promoting this one quite heavily from my perspective. But that’s not all. The book was generously blurbed, and quite gushingly, by several A-list American authors, including John Grisham, Stephen King, and Megan Abbott. Grisham and King, in particular, trumpeted the fact that this was a novel that you couldn’t put down. Indeed, this is a bit of a page-turner — if you don’t mind thinking about taking a nice hot shower as you read this. The thing with Two Nights in Lisbon is that it is more than just an effective thriller: it has something important to say and the ultimate subject matter of this novel is quite unsavory as it might be topical. I don’t want to reveal too much for those who have yet to wade into this book, but, suffice to say, I found myself putting it aside at certain moments because the real crime presented within it is so repellant and distasteful, if not violent, that I needed to take a break from the mechanization of this tome’s harrowing plot.
The novel is about a newlywed couple who are vacationing, sort of, in Lisbon, Portugal. I say sort of because it is also something of a business trip for the groom, John. However, he goes missing one morning and his wife Ariel immediately goes to both the police and the American embassy to get them on the case. Neither, of course, is of very much help to her. Then, she receives a phone call: it turns out that John has been kidnapped and Ariel has 48 hours to pull together three million euros in ransom to have him returned to her alive. Ariel, of course, doesn’t have that kind of money, but she happens to know people in her social circles who might. That is, of course, if they want to help her out — and they might have their reasons for not wanting to. And thus begins a bit of a cat-and-mouse game of double-crosses and requisite plot twists, and, naturally, the CIA winds up getting involved — which shouldn’t be saying too much as this is something mentioned near the beginning of this book.
Does that sound like a good premise for a thriller? It does to me, too. However, Two Nights in Lisbon veers off into unpredictable territory even though you can kind of figure out what’s likely to happen before it happens. This doesn’t make the book a less-than-stellar read; quite the contrary. This is a well-done slow burn, and the novel does go into important territory that has been covered by many thrillers being released these days: those that detail violence that is implicit against women. To that end, Pavone does a masterful job of creating a believable female protagonist who is quite vulnerable, but who does her fair share of fighting back against all sorts of injustices that are done to her. That’s probably the big selling point of this novel and what makes it so immensely readable. Having said that, though, this is also a challenging read because the book’s subject matter is bound to make readers quite uncomfortable. Thus, Two Nights in Lisbon is not an easy book to take. While it is a relatively quick to flip through even at being more than 400 pages in length (and it is a quick read because of its semi-predictability, which is a pleasure of its own and keeps the narrative moving), it could have been trimmed just a little bit. It feels a little overlong, with an epilogue that feels a bit tacked on to give this book a mercifully happy ending. (Or as happy of an ending as you could expect from a book such as this. This is not to say that I’m not happy it ends the way it does, but these characters really go through the wringer and there could have been, perhaps, a little less of that in the lead-up to the end.)
In the end, I’m not sure how far I would go in recommending Two Nights in Lisbon as a must-read novel. It is very well done, but it made me squirm. The writing is top drawer for being genre fiction— flaws are damned. And the book does have them: you can’t think of the twists and turns too hard, or the plot kind of comes undone. Without meaning to spoil anything, it turns out that the kidnappers go to an awful lot of trouble just to achieve their ends — though, at the same time, they must go to the lengths they go to. (For this reason, I guess I’m of two minds about this book.) In any event, perfection is always hard to come by, so we should be very satisfied with the care and craft that Pavone has put into this novel about the ugliness of American society and how women tend to get treated within it. Overall, Two Nights in Lisbon is going to appeal to readers who like their thrillers to thrill, but perhaps not too much. Me? I liked this, but didn’t love it — and the reason is that I now feel as though I have to have that hot shower to rinse away the griminess of the major crime that is ultimately revealed here. Two Nights in Lisbon is worth a look, but just be prepared to go against what those A-list writers were raving about. This is a novel you’ll want to put down now and then. You’ll need to just get through the repulsiveness of the female protagonist’s unfavorable experiences throughout this troubling yet searing work of genre fiction.
Chris Pavone’s Two Nights in Lisbon was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux / MCD on May 24, 2022.

I was traveling in Lisbon. That day, I went to an old restaurant listed in the Lonely Planet guidebook. A guitarist was playing traditional Portuguese music. Tourists from all over the world were drinking wine and talking, their faces bright with laughter. I had a few glasses of wine.
I began to feel the buzz. I grew tired of the place and left.
I kept walking. Not along the routes tourists take, but deeper into the old city. There were no pretty buildings. The walls were faded, and the windows sat still in the dark. The road wasn’t smooth — just an uneven path of small stones and rough cobbles. Every step caught my toes. I kept losing balance.
As night deepened, dim streetlamps flickered on, one by one.
Women stood along the roadside.
Drunk, I approached them. I stopped in front of one captivating woman. I wanted to say something. She didn’t understand me — but she named a price in English. “Want to fuck,” she said. I couldn’t understand anything else she said.
I couldn’t afford the full price. I handed her a bit of money, then turned and walked away.
I approached another woman. Did the same — gave her money, then left. I just wanted to talk to someone.
I kept stumbling forward. The streetlamps swayed.
After midnight passed, fog began to settle.At first it hung loose, then thickened. It sank heavy into the pitch-black streets. Every shop was dark, shutters pulled tight. My sight blurred, then slowly vanished. I couldn’t tell street from wall. I walked with my eyes on the ground.
There was no one around. Once in a while, a car passed. Its headlights flared into the fog — then faded without a trace. The dampness clung to my skin. I kept walking, aimless. I didn’t want to stop.
Around dawn, the fog began to lift.A narrow alley appeared. Beer cans. Torn snack wrappers. Soggy paper cups. Traces of someone who had been there through the night. But no one remained. No women. No cars. No sound. No people — just what was left behind.
I was tired. I headed back to my room.
Morning was coming. The street had changed. Taxis and buses passed in steady rhythm. The green leaves of roadside trees glimmered in the morning sun.
At an Indian restaurant, the shutter rolled up with a loud clatter. Workers carried boxes inside, turned on the lights, and scrubbed the floor. The scent of spices filled the air. Metal pots clanged, hoses sprayed water, voices echoed. Everything was waking up again.
People walked. Shops opened. The day had begun.
And in the middle of it all, with sunken eyes from a night spent in the street, I quietly walked back to my room.

I’m going to go ahead and assume that 2 Chainz was visiting Lisbon when he made that song. Ok…..maybe that’s a stretch, but seriously this city is literally vibrating with some of the best energy I’ve EVER been around. And I’m one of those hippy-dippy, “I need to feel the aura, the mojo, the vibe”… whatever you call it, to get a sense of whether I’ll like something. AND THIS PLACE GIVES ME ALLLL THE FEELS.
The best way for me to describe it is to actually borrow from my home office, Havas Chicago. We have 3 major tenants of what it means to be a Chi-town Havaser, they are: All In. Clever. Heart.
You can tell that every single person in the Lisbon Village is beaming with pride for their agency, clients and country. They proudly represent some of the biggest companies in Portugal.. a leading grocery store, a major bank and even the train system. I’m helping out on NOS, one of the leading telecom accounts in Portugal. About a year ago, NOS came to Havas and said they wanted to completely re-invent the brand. Havas answered in the most ALL IN way ever……creating Havas Different, a culturally relevant, hyper-village focused model designed to service NOS. The team re-invented the way they work, so that NOS and Havas can fulfill the collective vision and grow together. WOW!
As a strategist, I know that clever insights are both hard to come by, but also imperative to doing good work. My mentor, Joao (The Head of Strategy), and the other strategists in Lisbon have it down pat. The insights they bring to the table are simple, yet poignant and surprising, yet delivered in a way that makes you feel like you knew it all along. For example, when NOS tasked Havas to create a campaign for the Christmas season, the team came to the table with most clever insight around the most prominent fixture of the season, Santa. They asked themselves: if we live in 2018, where technology rules our lives….why are we still writing letters to Santa? So, they created a campaign all around the idea that Santa MUST have a phone number and NOS was going to bring it to you. Again, WOW! (smart insight jealousy rushes all over).
Upon arrival at the office, I was immediately greeted by Maria José (a beloved receptionist). She and the others taking a smoke break immediately flashed me smiles, grabbed me for a typical Portuguese double cheek kiss and proceeded to start teaching me Portuguese phrases I needed to know. After that, my mentor Joao took me around the office and introduced me to everyone….again👏🏽 every 👏🏽single 👏🏽person got up from their desks, gave me a double cheek kiss and was ready to teach me about their agency and culture. Before the day was up, I was invited to take a walk all around downtown, view the amazing sunset from the River and try a shot of Ginginha, a trademark drink in Portugal. They welcomed possibly the most stereotypical American, midwestern girl with open arms and big smiles. Again, WOW (tear of happiness streams down cheeks).
So, like I said, it’s truly a vibe here. It’s hard to put into words. I can’t even do it justice, but I’m OBSESSED and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.

Lisbon is a stunning city.
While it might be true that 1-day only is almost nothing for you to see the beauty of it, sometimes 1 day in Lisbon feels like a lifetime.
If You are planning a visit for the city, or even if you have no idea on what to expect.
I Got You!
Lisbon, the Portuguese Capital is a metropole, but when compared to other big cities, such as NY or London, it has a slow atmosphere. It feels like you’re in a fisherman’s village along the river.
Even in a slow way, it works as a big city, it’s a capital where You take 10 steps and listen 10 different languages.
People form all around comes to here, and you’ll probably never run out of things to do.
After all If we’re being honest here, the city is almost never “sleeping”.
Especially in the summer, when one part of city is going bed while the other is waking up.
Lisbon can be a lot even in just a few days.
Crazy as it sounds, as a Tourist Guide the thing I like to do the most in the city is…

It’s a question I’ve been asked countless times since moving to Lisbon from Lagos. Sometimes it’s asked with genuine curiosity. Other times, it feels more like a challenge — a polite way of saying, “You don’t look like you belong here.”
But the truth is, I’ve been asking myself the same thing, too.
When you leave home — really leave it — you don’t just pack a suitcase. You carry your culture, your accent, your rituals, and your invisible expectations. You try to wear them lightly, but they cling to you in moments you least expect, like when no one laughs at your jokes, or when your food smells “too much” in a shared kitchen.
What I didn’t expect was that losing my cultural footing in Portugal would help me discover who I am.
Growing up in Lagos, everything felt loud and alive. The streets were full of stories. There was always a neighbor knocking, a generator buzzing, a market woman shouting the price of tomatoes like it was breaking news.
I loved it. And I also wanted out.

I fell in love with Lisbon probably on the day I was born, even though I never got it until I started to travel through the world.
When I started traveling, I began to look at my city with the eyes of a tourist, and that's the best way to find some hidden secrets or to look at places where you normally just pass through without even looking.
I’ll just share with you some 5 places not to miss in Lisbon and help you get as enamored with my city as I am.
Lisbon is such an old city that one of my favorite neighborhoods is older than Portugal, being over 100 years old.
It’s one of those more typical neighborhoods in Lisbon where you can Fado houses and still see a bit of an old times type of life, with a thigh community in the middle of a big city.
It had become a very touristy place in the last couple of years, but it’s still possible to get lost and find some old stores, where you can find fun trinkets.
Fado is part of the tradition not only in Lisbon but specifically in this neighborhood, where you can find a “Casa de Fado” almost in every corner.

MeetnGreetMe together with our amazing travel blogger would like to share memories and some tips with you in case you have been thinking about visiting Portugal for a long time, or just decided to go there an hour ago! Today we will explore the best of Lisbon, Porto and Sintra. Together with Anastasia.
“At the beginning I will give you some general information about Portugal. Portugal shares borders with Spain and it’s the most western country in Europe — sounds interesting, am I right? If you want to have a condensed view of European landscapes, culture and the way of life, Portugal might be one of the best options for you. I have been there twice and I am sure I will go there again. My both visits were in February (Yes, it sounds cold but believe me, even in February it’s +18 and sunny…and nothing can spoil your time there).
I have visited only Lisbon and Porto and some small villages nearby (for me it is better to visit fewer cities but to feel them, rather than explore the whole “Europe on two feet a day”. That is why today I will tell you about these 2 cities.
How to get there?
As it was a planned trip, I booked flight tickets in advance (Warsaw-Lisbon-Warsaw) and it was only 80 euros (which is very cheap I think). From Lisbon to Porto I travelled by bus — 4 hours and 20 euros- may be you will find a cheaper way to get there, but I didn’t have enough time for it and used a simple intercity bus.
Lisbon is the capital and the largest city of Portugal. Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world, and the oldest in Western Europe. There are a lot of tourists all year long and you have to be prepared for much attention (especially if you are a woman), tasty food, good wine and hospitality….let’s go!
I will tell you about places I have visited and advice YOU to visit!
Rossio Square (Pedro IV Square)
Lisbon’s most famous square. There’s no better place in Lisbon to soak up the local atmosphere than at Pedro IV Square. It has been the city’s main gathering place since the Middle Ages. Today, it’s the place where friends meet up and as a result it’s always crowded — you will not miss it.
Monument to the Discoveries
It is the mammoth white-stone Monument to the Discoveries. Do you all remember Vasco da Gama- the first European to reach India by sea….Yes-yes, he was from Portugal. Now you understand why they have this monument and so proud of it. You can ride an elevator to enjoy the view from the top of this Lisbon landmark.
Alfama
The oldest quarter in historic Lisbon, the Alfama district is dotted with architectural landmarks and it’s the charm of the neighborhood’s meandering streets, tasty food and wine, clubs with Fado (amazing music) that make the Alfama a can’t-miss destination.
And one more life-hack — Tram line #28
The historic “tram” takes you through the city’s oldest sectors past some of Lisbon’s most popular sights and attractions. You don’t have to pay extra money (the ticket costs like a normal one — 3 euro).
Belem Tower
Belem Tower, also known as the Tower of St. Vincent, this statue was designed to protect sailors on their voyages, faces the river and makes an incredible impression on you.

I finally made it to Lisbon — bright tiled streets, salty breezes off the Tagus River, and the unmistakable smell of butter and sugar from the bakeries.
And there it was — pastéis de natas — the flaky, creamy, caramelized, and still warm pastry.
I had one on a street corner in Belém and thought to myself, ‘Yeah, this is one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. For those that may not know what it is — think about a croissant and creme brûlée mixture (it tastes like heaven!).
But somewhere between that first bite and the tourist-packed café I wandered into next, a strange feeling crept in. And it wasn’t for Portugal, but rather for Seabra’s.
If you know, you know: Seabra’s is a Portuguese supermarket in New Jersey. For me, there’s one just over the Goethals Bridge.
Seabra’s is loud, a little chaotic, and smells like chouriço and old linoleum.

Lisbon is Portugal’s hilly, coastal capital city. It’s Europe’s westernmost city and the only one on the Atlantic coast. From imposing São Jorge Castle, the view encompasses the old city’s pastel-colored buildings, Tagus Estuary and Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge. Lisbon’s geography, weather, and history make it a great city for running. There’s a terrific 5-mile path along the Tagus (Tejo) River, going by important museums and landmarks. A lovely downtown (Baixa) run along Av. de Liberdade takes you by important squares and buildings, to Eduardo VII Park. For hills, run the narrow streets and lanes of the Bairro Alto or Alfama neighborhoods, up to the Castle or one of the Miradouros (view points). The largest park is Monsanto, which is now well connected to downtown via a recently completed ‘green corridor’– a path through a linear park. And if you like hill running, this is your city!
Our complete guide to running in Lisbon can be found on the Great Runs site.
Riverside Run. 4.7 miles one-way to Belem Tower. Wonderful run along the water, passing under bridge.

If there is one thing we understand, it’s the importance of your student accommodation towards your general student experience. What’s more, we know a huge factor is your student home’s location. You want to live in one of the best neighborhoods, one that’s just as perfect for you as your residence. If this is you, let us guide you through Lisbon’s best neighborhoods for students!
Definitely one of the best neighborhoods for students, it’s very, very popular with international students. Marquês de Pombal is known among the locals as the central business district of the city and also as a major transportation hub. With two metro lines crossing here, and something like 20 different bus lines to catch, you’re always just a shot away from any place in the city. During the day, catch the sun up in the Eduardo VII gardens and after nightfall head down to the Kiosk-bars of Av. da Liberdade for drinks with your friends. There are many student residences nearby, including several that are Erasmus exclusive. Check out our student accommodation in Marquês de Pombal.
An Erasmus favorite! If you don’t want to have to go to parties, but prefer the parties to come to you, rent a room in the Bairro Alto. From Thursday to Saturday, the crowds fill up every one of the tiny bars here and spill out onto the streets. Thankfully, it’s quiet enough during the day, so you can party as much as you want throughout the night and then spend your mornings taking it easy inside. Friendly warning, you guys: Bairro is for party-animals only. Check out our student apartments and studios in Bairro Alto.
The large avenue (Alameda d. Afonso Henriques) that gives this area its name has a very wide garden with plenty of places for taking in Lisbon’s great weather and a kiosk-bar where you can have one of the coldest — and cheapest — glasses of beer to cool off. The streets to the sides of Alameda have plenty of student flat shares that are popular with Portuguese students, especially students of Instituto Superior Técnico (- called IST, or Técnico, for short). Click the link if you want to check out some student shared apartments in Alameda.
The neighbourhoods of São Sebatião and Saldanha are between three of the main universities of Lisbon: Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Nova), Universidade Católica de Portugal (Católica) and Técnico. It is not surprising, then, that you will find a student in nearly every building of the area. Some places like Bairro Azul are almost entirely occupied by students. It has great transportation options, the Gulbenkian Foundation with its museum, library and gardens (useful whether you feel like art, a stroll or some study time) and El Corte Inglés, the huge department store that also has over 12 cinema rooms. Click the links if you want to browse for student apartments in Saldanha or to rent student accommodation in São Sebastião.
Alfama is not only the historical quarters of Lisbon, it’s the city’s heart and soul. This is a personal favourite of mine — the neighbourhood where I have always lived. You’ll find there is nothing more charming than Alfama’s crazy, maze-like streets, and there is no better way of taking in the city’s culture than getting lost here. At night, you can hear Lisbon’s traditional music, Fado, being sung from a hundred little restaurants. Houses and apartments are traditionally rather small and hundreds of years old, but some studios and apartments have been recently refurbished and make the perfect student homes to live in. Interested? Click the link to see student accommodation in Alfama.
Thanks for reading this post! We hope to see you soon, coming back for more.

As a product manager who has navigated through various roles and experiences, I know how important it is to connect with others in the same field. But what happens when there’s no ready-made community for product managers in your city? You build one.
That’s precisely what I did when I launched the Product Management Society in Lisbon. The goal was simple: create a space where product managers could share knowledge, network, and help each other grow. But the impact has been far more significant than I ever anticipated.
The Product Management Society began as a small meetup group. We gathered product managers to discuss challenges, solutions, and industry trends. What I didn’t expect was how quickly the community would grow. To date, we’ve hosted 50+ events and built a community of 1,100+ members from multiple countries, all passionate about product management.
Our community is more than just a group of people — it’s a vibrant network of professionals supporting each other’s career growth. We connect through our Slack group, where discussions around best practices, job opportunities, and product management challenges take place. We also have a WhatsApp group (invite-only), providing a more immediate and casual way for members to stay in touch, share opportunities, and engage in real-time conversations.
We host regular events on Meetup, from casual networking to in-depth workshops and talks by seasoned professionals.
At the heart of our society is the belief that product management is better when we learn together. From our events and workshops to our blog, we are committed to delivering valuable content and experiences for PMs at every stage of their careers.
Some of the highlights include:
We’re not just about talk — we’re about action. The Product Management Society has already made valuable connections with companies and other organizations. One of the major highlights was our hiring event with Altar.io, which allowed our members to connect directly with a top product-focused company and potentially land roles in their teams.
We’ve also collaborated with Productized for multiple events, including where our members had the chance to meet industry leaders, expand their networks, and gain insights into the latest product management trends. Additionally, we partnered with Product Weekend for another collaboration that helped our members further their careers and expand their skills.
Furthermore, we have an ongoing collaboration with Radhika Dutt, the author of Radically Rethinking OKRs, as she works on her new book. This collaboration brings exclusive insights into how product managers can rethink their approach to goal-setting and OKRs, providing even more value to our members.
These collaborations are a testament to the growing influence of our society and the opportunities we can provide for product managers looking to advance in their careers.
If you’re a product manager based in Lisbon — or anywhere else in the world — we invite you to join us. The Product Management Society isn’t just about attending events, it’s about building relationships and fostering a sense of community. By joining our Slack group, you can start contributing to discussions and sharing your experiences. You’ll also find job postings, helpful resources, and answers to your burning questions. Our WhatsApp group (invite-only) takes the conversation to the next level, offering a more immediate space for feedback and quick interactions with fellow PMs.
Our Meetup page is regularly updated with upcoming events, where you can sign up to attend. Whether you’re looking to connect with peers, gain new insights, or find your next opportunity, there’s something for everyone.
The Product Management Society also runs a blog where members share their thoughts on the latest trends, challenges, and innovations in the field. Whether you’re a senior PM or just starting out, you’ll find valuable insights that can help shape your career and approach to product management.
You can check out the blog at blog.productmanagementsociety.com, where we post articles covering everything from product strategy to career advice. Our goal is to make this an ever-growing resource that PMs can turn to for practical advice and thought leadership.
Whether you’re looking to network, learn, or grow your career, joining the Product Management Society is an opportunity you don’t want to miss. We’ve created a space that fosters growth, collaboration, and professional development.
The Product Management Society has proven time and again to be a valuable resource for product managers. From hosting multiple events to building a community that supports one another, we’ve created something truly special in Lisbon — and we want you to be part of it.
So, come join us! Sign up for our events, join our Slack and WhatsApp groups, and start connecting with other like-minded professionals. Whether you’re looking to gain new insights, find your next job, or simply connect with others in the industry, we’ve got you covered.
Also, don’t forget to follow us on our LinkedIn page for updates and more!
Together, we can make the Product Management Society a place where we all grow, learn, and thrive!

This year I had the opportunity on both attending and speak at Droidcon Lisbon, in Portugal. It was an amazing first edition filled with amazing speakers and friends from throughout the country.
Recently I was searching for the slides of one of the talks and noticed that there was no global repository with them all, so well — now there is 🙌🙂.
If by any chance you’ve got slides that I ‘m missing — feel free to comment here or just ping me on twitter so I can add them 🙂.
None of this would be possible without the Droidcon team who organized the event, the speakers, sponsors, and of course all the attendees — thank you!
See you all next year 🚀

The final day on any trip is always a bit odd as there is a more clock watching brief to bear in mind as at some point there is that need to head off to the airport, you can’t just say sod it and get the next plane instead. And there is the packing, much of which on this trip meant refolding unused clothes we had brought. Mainly because there was the idea that we would come back in the evening, get changed, and then go out for food. Which didn’t happen at all, plus there was a bit of doubling up with hot and mild weather clothing. The unused side of the main case was a lot fuller than the dirty washing side.
Breakfast was the usual lunacy. We had been noticing little oddities, but I’ve rolled them all up into a leaving day edition. There has been a man in the hotel all week. Easily recognisable as he’s about 6’ 5”, bald and shiny at the front of his head, and then a foot long mullet down the back. He’s been getting a glass (for the fruit juice) and using it for coffee, pressing the americano button on one of the machines, and then whipping the glass out before the milk is poured (there is another machine which does just black coffee). He will then disappear, leaving the rest of the family in the restaurant, and then he would be back ten minutes later to do the same coffee routine all over again. It wasn’t until this morning that we saw where he was going. He went outside and sat in his car with the door open to drink his coffee, occasionally playing with the windscreen wipers (it wasn’t raining). I’m not who was happier with this arrangement, him, or his family.
Coffee in a fruit juice glass may sound weird, but there are always lunatics trying to go one better. In addition to mullet man, I have seen someone take a bowl (which is there for the cereals) and do their coffee into that. And conversely someone using a coffee cup to put their cereals in. Additionally, the breakfast room had a little Danone fridge in the corner, on investigation, it was full of Nestle yoghurts. I thought I wasn’t a morning person, but shit, I’m a fully functioning person compared to some of these.
Anyway, after the breakfast fun and games and packing, we checked out, left the cases, and went out for our last little wander of the trip. The fact we had dressed for going home and I had jeans and a jacket on meant it was bright sunshine and no rain.
We headed to the Edward VII park. It had been set out when most of the city was rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake, but they renamed it in honour of the visit of our king to the city in 1903. And for some reason they never renamed it back after he went home. Weirdos.
The park slopes gently uphill. Of course it does, this is Lisbon. You are going to be hard pushed to find anywhere flat to build a park.
About halfway up is the Pavilion Carlos Lopez which has some beautiful blue and white tiled scenes from history upon its walls.
In front of one a woman, and her photographer friend are set up. She has six juggling clubs with bright orange ends which she is juggling in front of the tiles while her friend takes phots from differing lengths away. When I say juggling, perhaps trying to juggle would be a more accurate description. When she drops most of the clubs, Helen and I say in unison, ‘sack the juggler.’
At the top of the park’s slope is a modern sculpture to the 1974 revolution.
And in front of it is the wonderful view down the hill, back over the laid out gardens, to the statue to the Marques de Pombal (who laid out the new city after the earthquake) in the middle of the double roundabout, along the main drag of the Avenue de Liberdade beyond and then there in the distance is the river.
Having come up one side of the park we go to amble down the other side and as we do we find ourselves outside the Lisbon Greenhouse.
It is a botanical garden, and we had seen the roof from above and the side and not twigged it was the greenhouse we had seen marked on the map. It is huge.
And full of greenery you may be surprised to know.
And flowers.
None of which I know the name of. Helen does, she knows most of them, and tells me what they are. Contrary to popular belief, I do listen when she tells me stuff, but where plant life is concerned, my mind does not want to keep that stuff. Which is a bit strange considering how much utter crap it is more than willing to keep.
I did retain the names of two, but only because I was been deliberately silly about them. Apparently, Nathan wants a cheese plant. Of which there were loads here, so many in fact it was more like a cheese forest, and I would certainly be happy if there was such a thing as a cheese forest and that cheese would grow on trees.
The other being a wisteria. And that’s only because I was saying I had heard people were going mad about this flower. ‘Really?’ came the puzzled response from Helen. ‘Yeah, it’s wisteria hysteria.’ I will point out I already had my coat and hat on at this point.
It was quite interesting, and I don’t mean in an air quotes fingers kind of way. Plus I was taking the opportunity to try and get some macro photography of the various flowers done.
I don’t know what these white ones are called, but trying to get near enough to them to do a macro shot was difficult as the juggler and her photographer mate had set up in front of them and now had another hanger on with them. In the previous half an hour or so since we’d last seen them hogging things worth taking pictures of, the juggling skills hadn’t improved.
We had heard the peacocks, but it wasn’t until we were outside again that we saw them. Just strutting around and not being tortured by moronic tourists into fanning out their feathers in distress.
There was time for a last café stop, a final cappuccino and pastel de nata in the park before it was time to head back to the hotel and pick up the cases ready for the journey to the airport.
Which didn’t take as long as the journey out seemed to.
I had the camera ready for some of the station art,
and got some blurred shots, some that missed altogether, some with window reflections,
and a feeling that somehow we’d missed a couple of stations as I was sure I’d seen some much more striking examples on the journey into the city.
The journey through the airport was smooth, bag drop was easy and for a change it was Helen getting the grilling about bag contents. Security was fine, there was a bit of duty-free shopping (not that there is duty on boxes of pastel de natas, just idiot tourist premium). I had been hoping to find a Forca Portugal store, but there wasn’t one. Having gotten Sporting Lisbon and Porto pens and magnets the previous day, I thought I would complete the big three, only for the Benfica official store not to have them, and the Football Gate store to have the Sporting and Porto stuff I’d got the day before, but to do no Benfica stuff because they had their own store.
Passport control was quick, and both coming out and going back the border police have been friendly and efficient. Something that perhaps the US ones could do with coming and getting some training on.
The queue at the gate was the usual bunfight / free for all. No sort of order in being called up, just get your elbows out and shuffle slowly forward in the queue. Or do what we did and sit there and wait for the back of the queue to come to us before joining it. And then find that on the plane there was no one else on our set of three seats, and the overhead lockers were empty. Bonus. Then it is roll to the runway and away we go.
Overall the trip was great.
Lisbon is a wonderful city. There is so much to see and do and four nights is nowhere near enough time to do anything more than scratch the surface. It is good exercise too, rest assured that if you walk for more than a couple of minutes in any direction there will be a hill to climb up or shuffle down.
The food has been wonderful, and it is cheap. Everything has been really tasty, and they certainly don’t scrimp on their portion sizes (they must know people need feeding up to be able to deal with walking up all those hills). And the people are so friendly.
The Azulejos are wonderful, and there are many splendid examples of art on the tiles. Although the occasional one did make us smile for the wrong reason. This one was designed to represent justice with the scales. But all I can see is saggy tits. Which again, says more about me than anybody else.
The only downsides have been the very showery weather, which no one can really do anything about, and which hasn’t dampened our spirits anywhere near the amount they have dampened out clothes. And the attempted pickpocket / bag theft thing.
But we would definitely recommend coming back with more time to get around more of the city and beyond (Sintra is only 45 minutes away).

The History of the Siege of Lisbon by Jose Saramago (reviewed by Richard Seltzer),https://medium.com/@seltzer_57387/the-history-of-the-siege-of-lisbon-by-jose-saramago-reviewed-by-richard-seltz45-3a4214aed473,"Sign up

This is an excerpt from my book One Family, which is available from Amazon.
At the start of the Second Crusade, troops sailing to the Holy Land, stopped, by chance, at Lisbon and helped defeat the Moors, resulting in Portugal becoming a country and Afonso Henriques (our ancestor) its first king.
Jose Saramago (Nobel winner) wrote a novel with the title The History of the Siege of Lisbon, which questions historical truth in a paradoxical, philosophical, and comical style that resembles that of Borges and Lem. At the same time he tells the love story of two employees at a publishing house in modern-day Lisbon, a proof-reader and his boss.
The proof-reader, succumbing to an inexplicable urge, changes one word in a history book about the 1147 siege of Lisbon. The Crusaders say “no,” instead of “yes.” They sail on rather than stopping to help fight the Moors.
A woman hired to supervise proof-readers and prevent another such egregious error is intrigued by the implications of the mistake and by the proof-reader himself. She surreptitiously suggests that he write a novel that explores the possible consequences if that “no” had been historically true.
The narrative switches back and forth between present-day Lisbon and an alternative medieval past written by the proof-reader. His version of what happened is consistent with the fragmentary historical evidence, and is credibly told, with gritty texture and the addition of a love story that parallels his romance with his new boss. The Crusaders’ decision, rather than creating a tornado of consequences and changing all that came after, only leads to differences in how the battle is won and who deserves credit; the outcome is the same. The rip in time caused by the change from “yes” to “no” closes as if it had never happened. The fictitious version of events, created by the proof-reader, might be closer to what actually happened than the official version.
Saramago turns what might otherwise have become an academic discourse on history, fiction, and truth into an entertaining double love story that plays out in the same city, but separated by 850 years. In this book, facts aren’t as important as they’re usually represented to be. There are a few well-known fixed points on a time line, and there are numerous possible story-paths from one point to another, all of which are equally valid, because they lead to the same conclusion. By looking at more than one possible path, you come to know the characters and their circumstances with the texture, ambiguity, and shading of reality, with its dynamic tensions and ever-changing possibilities, rather than with the static view of linear historical narrative. The author succeeds in showing the heroic and passionate potential of everyday people in everyday circumstances.
I wish I could achieve such a result.

I came to Lisbon for the vibe.
What I got was a full-body workout, a minor existential crisis, and two pairs of shoes that now live in the trash.
Let me be clear: Lisbon is stunning. Lisbon is magic. Lisbon is the seductive European city that will woo you with pastel buildings, flirt with you using tilework, and then betray you with an incline so steep your knees will write a resignation letter.
This is not a walkable city. This is a city designed by and for mountain goats.
You know when a city greets you gently? When it says, “Hey, take it easy. Ease into it. Grab a coffee. Sit by the river.”
Lisbon doesn’t do that.
Lisbon hands you a map, points vaguely uphill, and says, “Figure it out, loser.”
I arrived with optimism. I had good shoes. I had snacks. I had a plan.
Thirty minutes later, I was clinging to a stone wall, sweating through my t-shirt, trying to decide if I should keep walking or roll back down into the harbor and let the Atlantic take me.

I didn’t mean to get lost in Lisbon.
I had landed with a rough map scribbled on a napkin, a backpack full of enthusiasm, and absolutely no clue how confusing the city’s steep, winding streets could be. I’d seen pictures of the iconic yellow trams, the tiled facades, and the miradors overlooking terracotta rooftops. But none of those Instagram posts prepared me for what it actually felt like to be completely disoriented in a foreign city, hungry, sweaty, and mildly annoyed with Google Maps.
It started innocently enough: a walk through Alfama, the oldest district in Lisbon, with its maze-like alleys and whispers of Fado music echoing from open windows. I turned one wrong corner, then another, and before I knew it, I was somewhere between “definitely not where I should be” and “oh, this looks kind of magical.”
That’s the thing about Lisbon — it forgives your mistakes by rewarding you with charm. One detour led me to a tiny café run by an old couple who didn’t speak English but insisted I try their homemade bacalhau. Another wrong turn led to a bookstore with poetry written on the walls and a cat sleeping on a pile of Portuguese novels.
By the time I figured out where I was (eventually — thank you, tram 28), I had stopped caring about the original destination. Somewhere between losing the route and finding a rhythm, I realized that this…

At Christmas I got several photography books in the Abandoned / Oblivion series of books published by Jonglez; Abandoned Churches, Abandoned Spain, Abandoned France, Abandoned USSR, Oblivion, Forgotten Heritage, Forbidden Places. I’ve had a look at the other titles in the series (USA, Belgium, Australia, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Germany) but was surprised to find there isn’t one for Portugal.
Having spent four days wandering around Lisbon I am sure that an intrepid urban explorer and photographer could fill such a book with examples from Lisbon alone.
There are lots of properly abandoned buildings all over the place of all shapes and sizes.
Some on the main streets of the city, boarded or shuttered up.
Peeling paint or plaster disappearing from the surface of the buildings helped along by the constant weathering.
Nature is trying to reclaim some of these for itself. There is a lot going on.
Unlike a lot of examples included in the series of books I have seen and have mentioned above, these aren’t necessarily isolated buildings. They sit in and amongst fully functioning, well kept and maintained, houses, shops, restaurants, and other businesses.
It is oddities, it isn’t like they are whole blocks left to go to rack and ruin. I may have seen one side of a street where all the buildings looked to be abandoned and on their last legs, but that was the exception rather than the rule.
To the south of the city and all the way along the bank of the River Tagus opposite Lisbon, from the April 25th suspension bridge going to the east until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
They look as if they must have been industrial units, but the whole stretch is mainly roofless, and the graffiti artists have been out in force.
It did look as if there was one little bar in amongst it all. But there was no obvious route down to get to the stretch of buildings. How would someone get there?
I am fascinated by this stretch of buildings, but as to how to get in there, I’m better off not knowing as I would just have spent a lost day wandering around the whole stretch clicking away and filling up my SD card.
And the spare one.
There are other buildings in disrepair, but they at least show signs of being worked on, metal and wooden fences surround them. There are piles of materials around, and there are cranes hovering above them.
I suppose if you went and looked hard enough in any town or city you would find examples of abandonment, but it feels different in Lisbon, I haven’t gone searching for examples, it is almost as if they have come to me. Though what I find strange now that I am home and I am searching through all the photographs I took, is ones I am sure I took of abandoned and crumbling buildings aren’t there, which makes me doubt my sanity. Most of the ones I have are of the riverside.
But I don’t speak the language and therefore don’t know what any notices on buildings may be saying. I don’t know what the law is about entering such buildings, and how the police would deal with such things. And most importantly I am on holiday with Helen, so I don’t go looking for that opening, for a chance to get inside one of these buildings and snap away.
Perhaps someone will, or there is someone already doing it, or even someone has already done it, and it is the next Jonglez abandoned series one to come out.

March 17 has passed, and the EDP Lisbon Half Marathon 2024 is over. I can share my personal impressions about the race. There was a lot of fun, but also things the Lisbon folks should work on.
The race kit was okay, including a T-shirt, a bib, a cap (an excellent choice, as you’ll see why later), a magazine, some bags of tea, a cereal snack, an electrolyte pill, and a magazine. A very useful kit.
The quality of the T-shirt and the cap was very good.
My running buddy and I chose to stay in the downtown area, near the Marques De Pombal, at the Marques De Pombal Hotel, of course.
Access to the race is limited, and you can only get there by train. All participants must use the Fertagus train to reach the starting line at the Pragal station. To access the Fertagus train stations, athletes can use Lisbon’s public transportation system (subway, buses, and trains) for free by presenting their BIB. You have to take the metro and get off at the Jardim Zoológico station to get there. From there, you don’t have to go outside; just follow the train sign to reach the train station.
While on the train, I kept looking for the “25 April Bridge” to realize that we were on the bridge, just under the road where we were supposed to be running soon. The train trip was short, about 10–15 minutes.
We arrived at the last station at 8:55, and the race was supposed to start at 10:05. We thought we had plenty of time to get to our designated start wave. I was supposed to start from Box2, while my running buddy was supposed to start from Box3.
The first thing we noticed was that the only accessway was pretty packed with many people.
We did not panic and just followed the path until we got stuck in a sea of people. We were blocked in that spot for 30–40 minutes with little information about what was happening. There were no staff or organizing people around, just some policemen blocking the access.
We also thought we had time and space to warm up, but this was almost impossible with so many people trying to get into the designated starting box areas. This was my first half marathon where I did not do any warmup or stretching, nothing. It was impossible.
This was also the first half marathon where I had to stay in line and wait for tens of minutes with little information about what was going on. It was clear we were very far from the starting area.
At some point, the crowd started to move gradually, and we managed to pass the first checkpoint. We reached a zone where someone was yelling instructions about which way you should take to get to your designated starting area. There were no signs whatsoever, just a single volunteer yelling and trying his best.
For me, this was terrible organizing. Although I was at the race one hour and five minutes before the start, I didn’t manage to get to my box in time, and I had no place to warm up!
By the time I got to the starting areas, the lucky ones had already been in the race for 6 minutes.
I started at last! But it was so crowded on the bridge that I was forced to run on a metal grill next to the asphalt car lane. You could see the water down below, and the running feeling was odd. Most runners avoided the grill, but it was the only option to get in front of other runners. And I kept running on that uncomfortable grill for almost 1-2 km, I believe.
I overcame thousands of runners since I started from the back of the herd, and two days after the race, I am still paying for that effort. Around km 8, getting in front of other runners became easy. Till then, you had to do a lot of maneuvering to get in front.
I give a big F for the start experience.
The weather in Lisbon in March is unpredictable; while in the morning it is a bit cold, clouds cover the sun, but as soon as you pass 10:30, the sun comes out and starts to shine and burn.
My Garmin watch said that the average temperature was 28 degrees Celsius (82F) during the race, with a maximum of 33 degrees (91F). The weather prediction was 24C, measured in the shade, but starting with km 9, the entire race was under a nice shining sun.
Starting with km 18, I began to count the number of people who fainted on the side, and I think I counted 10–15 of them. Volunteers and medics were trying to relieve their pain, but seeing so many people dropping out of the race kind of made me more cautious.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed this race and loved my time spent in Lisbon. I recommend visiting this city because it is very nice, has good food, is relaxed, is clean, and has many things to do. It was my second time here, and I will come back the third, fourth, and fifth times whenever possible.
In my previous post, I wrote that my Garmin watch was predicting a finish of 1:46:54, and I thought that it was being conservative. I wanted to achieve more of a 1:44 finish time. It seems that Garmin wasn’t far off from my result. I finished in 1:46:46, which is eerily accurate!
I have mixed feelings about Garmin!
I’ve added some more pictures at the end and recommend doing the Lisbon Half Marathon. It is a race designed for a PB, and you can visit a great city.
The only tip I have is to get to the starting line two hours ahead, and I’m not kidding!

To avoid the worst of the carnage at breakfast it was breakfast first then get ready to head out this morning to get more touring done. It had been raining when we got up but was bright sunshine by the time we were leaving the hotel, only for the moment we sat on the tour minibus it to want to start to rain. And we were on a minibus whose roof was broken and stuck in the open position. But we stayed in our seats and toughed it out as it went from rain to bright sunshine, back to rain and back to sun again as we went round.
We were on the green route and done the stretch from Liberatores to the Castle the previous afternoon, but this time we did almost the full route, only getting off when we got back to the second Liberatores stop and hour and a half after the first one.
And I don’t give a shit if I am repeating myself, I would not want to be driving on most of the roads the minibus travelled on. In fact I would go so far as to say that driving in Lisbon is not for me full stop, but it does lend some insight to the story of the Portuguese taxi driver we had in Leicester back in the late eighties.
There is plenty to see on the way around and it is a struggle to get anything remotely related to good photos. Between dodging raindrops, the vibrations of the cobbled streets, there are angles to consider, bus frame to avoid, and when you think you’ve got it all lined up ready to go the lights change to green or traffic clears and the bus lurches forward with some sudden acceleration.
What the results look like will be interesting viewing once back home and they have all been loaded onto the laptop.
When we got off the bus, we chose a different road to wander down to get to the river, picking one which isn’t festooned with cafes and restaurants and full of desperate men trying to strong arm you into eating at their particular offering. The number of times you can run that gauntlet without just wanting to scream at them to fuck off is limited. The one we pick has a gentle incline to it, which is somewhat of a concern seeing as we are supposed to be heading down to the river. We reach the crest of the road and find it must have been more than a gentle climb. Either that or we are getting used to the hilly nature of the city, as the road down the other side is seriously steep, and we really didn’t think we’d come up so high.
At the top there was a mall, which we took advantage of to use the facilities (that is one thing about Lisbon which isn’t great, there aren’t very many public toilets at all, and so when there are, there are always queues). I’m queuing for a cubicle only for a little brat to queue jump and run in when the old man in there leaves. I take the next available one, and whilst in there I can hear the impatient brat shout to his dad, ‘I’m finished.’ His dad tells him to wait while he himself finishes. Only for the kid to yell ‘for fucks sake, hurry up, the Lego shop is closing.’ (It wasn’t it was half twelve and they don’t shut for lunch.) Hopefully, the Lego shop became the Lego-without shop for the little shit.
The road down takes us back to the Commerce Square and across to the river. It’s time for the next tour, only this time there is no bus, it is on the river. There’s a big river and tours on the river, so of course we are there, we’re well-known suckers for a water level view of a city.
We get some refreshments, sort out the correct token for the tour (part of the HOHO ticket), and find the correct queue (not as easy as it sounds) and get on the little boat. And when I say little boat, I mean it. We had seen the larger boats for other tour companies on the river, but this is tiny, like a minibus compared to the double deckers the others are using. But even so it isn’t full.
Again the weather thinks it is funny. It was bright sunshine as we sit having a bit of lunch, the rain only appears when we set off on the boat. It does have most of its plastic splash protectors down which helps. But not with taking photos.
But the rain does fuck off to be replaced by the sun before too long.
The original route is for the little boat to go down the south side of the river on the westbound leg of the journey, but with the rain, and the threatening clouds, it stays to the north and concentrates on the Lisbon side of the river.
Being out in the vast expanse of the river gives you an unobstructed view of how the city rises away from the river and the layers of buildings of all types rising into the hills.
The cargo terminal is fascinating (to me anyway). Just how huge the container ships are, and how the containers slot together to stack up and stay in place like a giant Lego set. (perhaps drop some on this on that kid from earlier).
And there is the bridge. You can see it is large from a long way away. But the sheer scale really hits home when you are going under it.
It had looked as if our little tour boar was going to ram the yacht, but we only passed close by to it just as we were both going under the bridge, which made a decent photo.
By the time we had made our way past the MAAT buildings we had been on the day before, and out to Belem, the sun was shining.
And there were plenty of opportunities to take decent photographs of the Monument to the Discoveries.
The Belem Tower is a much better photograph from the water than from the top of the tour bus as attempted yesterday.
This is where we turn around to head back and there is a terminal for people to get on and off as even the boat tour is a HOHO. Every other passenger got off, and were replaced by a new set, and off we went back to central Lisbon.
We crossed over to the southside of the river to do so. And besides the obvious tourist photographs of the Christ the King statue, there was much that interested me.
A bit further out to the west from Belem was this, which I am assuming is some kind of refinery type building.
Just before the suspension bridge is another very colourful refinery building.
There are egg shaped structures set into the slopes of the south bank.
And once past the bridge and all the way along the bank until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
We swing back over to the north side of the river and with the sun shining on the city along the stretch of government / municipal eighteenth century buildings painted in assorted colours, and the domes and spires of churches behind them, it has a very Venice-esque look to it.
When the little boat docks at the third of its little stops we get off. The wind whilst on the water has been bitter and we have walked the short stretch back to where the loop would be complete before, so we head off to look for food and to warm up.
The pier is close to where we ate on the first night we were here, and therefore we know that the Time Out Market is only just behind the buildings we can see.
But it is chaotic in there and we want to be able to just sit and relax, order something from a menu and have it delivered to a table, not try and work out which of the forty odd options to order from and then fight to try and find two seats together somewhere in the heaving mass of humanity in the middle of the hall.
We do take the opportunity to use the facilities though. Whilst I am waiting for Helen (the queue for the ladies is unsurprisingly longer and slower moving), I see a bloke go and drag his (I assume) other half out of the queue and shove her into the unused baby change facilities toilet. Once she is in there he is pacing furiously back and forth but gradually further away, and then outside. People who actually have babies to change are now queuing to use it. I get the feeling she’s had more than enough of his shit and is deliberately taking as long as possible or just hiding. Helen comes back before she reappears, but he’s not in sight, and we go the other way. Hopefully, there was a backway out and he’s still pacing there now. Alone.
We use the guidebook to see if there are any recommended eateries near to where we are, and it does mention a place within a couple of minutes’ walk the Rio Grande. A lovely old traditional restaurant with decorative tiles on the walls and old wooden beams.
What we didn’t realise when we went in from the front door was that the side window where we were seated overlooks Pink Street.
And outside our window as we eat there is a drag act in a skintight purple jumpsuit with a long blonde wig (which keeps trying to escape) on roller skates, and armed with a wheelie bin, who is entertaining / terrorising the passing tourists.
We had found Pink Street as we had wanted, but without even trying.
The food, as all food so far has been, was lush, and after getting past the drag act unmolested, we headed back up another different street towards the hotel. Where it was a case of have a bit of a rest and then change to layer up for yet another tour. This time the night bus tour. And not a single Harry Potter in sight.
Three of the others who had been on the previous evening’s walking tour were on this tour as well, making the fullest use of their tickets as well then. But on the whole, it was a sparsely populated bus when the tour set off. Which did mean it was good for me as I could move around a bit in the hope of trying to get some decent photographs.
It starts out fine as there is still reasonable light at 8pm.
But night is falling, and it is doing so quickly.
And whereas the camera can cope with any difficulties thrown at it in daylight, at night it struggles. (or to be more precise, I struggle to be able to set it up, so it doesn’t struggle as much.)
It can cope OK when it is dead still, but as the night tour doesn’t have and pick up points around it the only stops are at traffic lights, so there is a fair bit of motion to deal with.
And as light fades the camera tries to extend the shutter speed to let more light in, which when moving means blurring.
So there I am hoping for traffic lights to be red, or for magical traffic jams to appear.
To be fair I did get some reasonable shots whilst the bus was stationary.
But the one I wanted was when the route went over the bridge above Pink Street. I knew when it was coming, I had the lens at the right length of focus, I had the timing right, but the bus was moving too quickly as there was no traffic and no traffic lights and so it ended up a bit blurry.
It is dark by the time the hour-long tour is up, and we head back to the hotel. We had seen the café on the roundabout was open as the bus came past. Two minutes later as we pass it walking back it is closed and in darkness, so it is back to the room and chill.
There are no planned tours tomorrow, just us mooching on our last full day.

After two days of being toured out, it was time for a bit of freestyling. It did still start on a bus though. A regular Lisbon public transport one, taking us down to one of the main squares in the centre of the city. Whilst waiting for it to turn up I was admiring the doors and doorways as I usually do (yes, I know I’m strange), and I saw this one close to the bus stop.
Noting the number twenty-five above it, I spent the rest of the day looking out for any other doors or doorways with the number twenty-five above them. It was a surprise just how many streets there were where the numbers stopped at twenty-three, or upon which the number twenty-five was missing from above the doorway where number twenty-five should be. Still, I got plenty for the little side project that had popped up in my head.
We were on the bus to the end of the line at Rossio, and from there we started the long slow ascent up through winding narrow cobbled streets and steps up (and some back down again thirty yards further down the same road).
Some of the streets in this area have poignant pictures attached to the walls, some project which took photographs of those who live, or used to live in the houses there and they have been reproduced onto boards in an almost sepia colour, the history from inside the walls being displayed on the outside of them.
There were a couple of stops to do some shopping for tat. The usual, pens, postcards, fridge magnets. But we made it up to the castle entrance.
Which was a lunatic asylum. The queue was stupidly long, and there appeared to be three different sub queues and people changing between them because they didn’t know which one was the correct one to be standing in.
We weren’t desperate to go inside the castle and so we wandered the streets around the castle complex at the top of the hill. We saw (and heard) peacocks. Only for some dicks to come along and deliberately spook the peacock so it expanded its tail feathers as a defence mechanism. There really are some stupid humans around.
There are also Azulejos on walls everywhere in many different patterns and assorted colours (which triggered another thought for another little set of photographs for a project).
Before we stopped for a drink in a café called Tram 28. (Named for the tourist tram which rattles up the narrow streets to the castle and always looks like a sardine tin on rails.) The inside looks as if it has been built from two trams pushed together. A drink turned into lunch and a postcard writing session before we headed on.
And it isn’t everywhere where you are going to find a Tram Burger.
Across the little square was a church, we went in one side and out the other, and briefly thought about going up the tower, but a rude German family pushed in, and we saw the cost, and decided against it.
Instead we continued wandering around the narrow streets, gradually making our way down and out of the castle complex.
We then did a bit of retracing steps, following a bit of the route down from the castle to the cathedral which we had taken on the waking tour a couple of evenings before. I nipped into the cathedral to get a fridge magnet and a brief dodge of raindrops before heading on.
And out the other side we were then walking on street not previously travelled. More narrow streets, little alleys, steep staircases up, and down, between all sorts of buildings.
Unlike the planned grid of the centre of the city, this part of the city, Alfama, the oldest part, a lot of which survived the earthquake of 1755, wouldn’t know a grid if it hit it found the face with one of the cities beloved sardines. It is wonderfully winding, and you might spy where you want to be heading, only to find a couple of minutes later that it is in a totally different direction to the one you thought you were heading in. We pick up a couple of pastel de natas to help us along the way.
It is in this style we wander the streets before eventually finding our way up to the church of St Vincent. Which is absolutely huge. And wants to charge for you to go in.
But they, as the cathedral did, have some doors available for you to go in and sit in the back two rows of the nave of the church and get a long-distance view of the inside of the church (easily overcome with a zoom lens).
The intermittent showering has turned into constant drizzle, and the back two rows of the church were a brief interlude, we stop at a café to, if not dry off, then at least stop getting any damper. A drink and a pit stop later, and it is back out.
It is still raining. We make it down to the former church of Santa Engracia. This baroque church is no longer a place of worship. It now houses the Panteao Nacional (The National Pantheon).
This time we do pay to get in, a prolonged break from the rain will be good. The building houses the cenotaphs and tombs of famous and influential figures from Portuguese history.
It is a serious space, but I can’t help it if my head is the opposite of a serious space, and seeing this name on one of the cenotaphs, I can’t help but ask does it also contain a hot dog, and a jumping frog.
A lot of the tombs now housed here were originally entombed at the Jeronimos Monastery before they were moved here in the 1960s. Reading the biographies of the people here next to each of the monuments, you can’t help but notice just how many of them went to the University of Coimbra, which must be the Portuguese equivalent of going to Oxbridge.
We are able to go up to various levels, where there are displays of reliquaries, and collected artworks.
And then we are up at the dome level. There is an exit out onto the (nearly) flat roof.
On a clear dry day, the views out over the city and the river must be spectacular. But it is neither. The April 25th Bridge and Christ the King statues are barely visible through the low cloud / rainfall. But it does seem to be easing off.
Inside the dome there is a walkway all the way around the dome. It is a long way down. My knees were going (and not just because of all the steps climbed to get up here) and the head was a bit woozy.
By the time we had made it back to ground level and had a walk around the former church and chapels looking at all the luminaries in big marble boxes (including, in a surprise to me, the footballer Eusebio), and headed back outside, it had stopped raining.
And so the wandering around continued. There are museums everywhere it would seem. To everything. In fact I think all that is missing is a museum to museums.
We find ourselves back at the river, only to turn and head away from it again and head back towards where we had gotten off the bus this morning on the search for somewhere for us to have our traditional away on holiday curry. There was a detour to find a post office so we could send the postcards we had written earlier.
Still it is trying to rain intermittently. We had seen a potential place on giggle maps and head into an alley off a side street, go up some steps for a change and find the basic looking Nepalese / Indian restaurant.
It may look basic, but the food is amazing, and it is so cheap. Two meals and two drinks each only come to thirty-one Euros. I can see why it is a 4.9 on Trip Advisor. The place is called ODAAN, it is hidden away, but definitely well worth finding.
When we come out the rain has stopped, and the sun is out. There isn’t a cloud in the sky now. And so we head for the Santa Justa lift. As we pass through the square the queue for the 28 tram is as ridiculous as it has been every time we pass here. It may be the iconic symbol of Lisbon tourism, but seriously, who wants to be Lisbon’s favourite dish — sardines — on a tram, hardly able to see out of the windows on the trip up. You’d be far better off having a slow walk up following the tram tracks and being able to see it all.
Having mocked others queuing, there is a queue for the Santa Justa lift, built near the turn of the twentieth century by a disciple of Gustav Eiffel. Only one of the two lifts in its tower are working, but the queue moves quickly enough. It connects the centre of the city with the Bairro Alto high above it.
Once at the top of the lift, the little spiral staircases up to the upper level of the viewing platform are closed, but the views out from lift level are worth the cost of coming up in it.
With the clouds having finally buggered off for the day there are magnificent views out over the city, across to the castle, and down to the river.
And behind it over the Carmel monastery which the exit from the lift takes you past.
It was one of the main flashpoints of the 1974 revolution, and it is a ruin, with little of the roof left on it. Some is used to house a museum. Unusual for Lisbon, I know.
We have been through this area on the bus but find some streets we haven’t been along to walk down (or more accurately at this point up).
The buildings are being lit up, including this theatre bathed in pink light.
There is another viewing point over the city, it is by the top of the funicular we went down in on our first night here. The castle opposite is lit up in green light, but for some reason the camera doesn’t want to know that and will only take the photo with it in an orange glow.
Once you have got past the mass of self-obsessed, selfie taking Instagrammers which plague viewpoints the world over now. Saying that we did try to take a selfie, but the reason we don’t usually take selfies is because we’re both shit at it, and the more photos I seem to have taken of me recently, the more my eyes are changing into the bastard sons of Marty Feldman’s.
The Bairro area is lined with huts serving food and drink and we grab drinks to go and head up roads we’ve been on a tour bus going in the opposite direction to.
I’m still trying to take nighttime shots of interest as we pass.
Helen mentions it would be nice to get some cheese, but there is nowhere open that sells cheese. We see a pharmacy (always a plus), and joke that it should be possible to get cheese on prescription.
We end up on another very steep downhill path, so much so they have made half the footpath into steps. At the bottom it isn’t far to get to the hotel, and time to collapse and rest.
And to try not to think that we have to go home tomorrow.

This was my fourth Web Summit, Europe’s if not the world’s biggest gathering of those plying the tech ecosystem. The conference has grown considerably since its humble beginnings in Dublin where its organizers remain domiciled. It’s not just the number of conference attendees, but its growing footprint in other regions that sets it apart from other confabs. Its portfolio currently includes Collision in Toronto, Web Summits in Lisbon, Rio and Qatar, and Rise in Hong Kong (2025).
Here are some data points from the just-concluded Lisbon event:
The record-breaking attendance happened despite the conference founder’s ill-conceived remarks on the Gaza conflict two weeks before Web Summit started. It sparked an exodus of big-named sponsors and speakers, as well as the resignation of the founder himself.
Very quickly, however, Web Summit secured a new CEO, Katherine Maher, the CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, who plugged the leaks and, within two weeks, righted the ship.
One afternoon back at the hotel, we shared an elevator with Katherine, where we had a chance to let her know how much we enjoyed her opening night presentation. She appreciated the feedback.
Since attending the final Dublin-based Web Summit in 2015, I’ve fallen into a regular cadence at subsequent events, including two on-stage moderation sessions, judging the start-up Pitch competition, participating in Mentor Hours, attending a couple of speaker dinners, and carving out time to listen to some of the more noteworthy speakers.
Two themes permeated this year’s conference: AI and climate, with the latter dominating many of the startups presenting.
On the AI front, I took the stage with Mikayel Vardanyan, co-founder of unicorn Picsart, the largest all-in-one creative platform of photo, video editing, and design tools — now fully immersed in Generative AI for creating images and video.
This is quite an impressive company with 1.5 billion downloads. Still, I had to bring up Gen AI bias after my query on the platform for a “successful business person” turned up four images — all of the same 40-year-old white man. I also worried aloud about the likelihood of bad actors using deep fakes to manipulate public opinion. Yes, that means you, Russia.
In my second on-stage session, I sat with some veteran marketing execs to discuss the changing role of the CMO. I reminisced about Y&R Inc’s “whole egg” approach wherein advertising, PR, and direct response comprised the three legs of the marketing stool. (Brand identity/design was siloed away back then.) I suggested that Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall, giving today’s marketers vastly more tools with which to work.
I suppose the greatest satisfaction for me was gleaned from connecting with founders about their early-stage companies’ plans to change the world for the better. This happened on the Pitch Stage where I judged a handful of companies whose solutions to small and big problems didn’t fail to impress. I also had a chance to mentor three young founders in the climate space: Guillaume Mandolini of EVAS, Dragan Gelevski of EarthCare.ai, and Diogo Costa of EcoCradle, who had these kinds words to share following our session:
There were other notable encounters, including over lunch when former Trump chief-of-staff Mick Mulvaney plopped down beside my wife and me. He, alongside esteemed journalist Michael Isikoff, suggested a political scenario in which both Trump and Biden drop out of the race. I wasn’t buying it.
You never know who you’ll run into at Web Summit, but everyone there had an affinity for technology and how it will continue to change our lives and livelihoods. Even Mick Mulvaney was there to speak about the tech regulatory environment.

Introduction:
In the heart of Lisbon, a city steeped in history and shrouded in mystery, magic pulses truly under the cobblestone streets. *Whispers of Lisbon* tells the story of Amara, a young historian with a gift for paying attention to the voices of the past, and Rafael, an enigmatic mother or father with ties to a historical magical order.
When their fates collide, they must navigate the secrets and techniques hidden within the metropolis’s winding alleys and get to the bottom of a centuries-old curse that threatens to consume them each.
As love blossoms amid the shadows, they discover that their destinies are more entwined than they may have ever imagined.
Chapter 1: Echoes inside the Alfama
Amara Mendes wandered via the slim, winding streets of the Alfama district, the oldest neighborhood in Lisbon.
The scent of grilled sardines and freshly baked pastéis de nata lingered in the air, blending with the faint notes of Fado music drifting from a nearby tavern.
As she traced her fingers along the historic partitions, she felt it once more — a faint, ghostly whisper that simply she needed to hear.

It was supposed to be a chill walk.
I had Spotify in my ears.Google Maps in my hand.And absolutely no idea where I was going.
Welcome to day 2 of my solo trip.Sunburnt, sleep-deprived, and 100% lost in Lisbon.

I didn’t.
Instead, I kept walking.Up a street that was definitely a hill.Through a park that might’ve been private property.Past a guy yelling at pigeons.
Until I sat on the edge of a fountain, next to a trash can, and cried behind my sunglasses like a drama queen on a budget airline.
I was crying because I was tired of pretending I wasn’t.
Not just that day.In general.

No subscription? Read it here.
We went to The Obsidian Room near the river to celebrate closing the Lisbon project.
No pricing anywhere. Dark wooden panels. Thick white tablecloths. Everything was heavy. Even the metal-sleeved menus.
Hugh was there with a few others from the team. My team. A couple of the finance lot joined. The rest were clients who’d flown over from the States.
There was champagne on arrival. Everyone was shaking hands, swapping cards, patting backs. All smiles now that it was over and I’d made them look good.
When we sat, one of the Americans started a speech in my honour. I bowed my head. Humble.
He raised his glass. “To Lisbon.”
Caught Hugh watching me, just for a second. I was on top. He knew it. Everyone knew it. He didn’t like it.
I stood, “They said it couldn’t be done. But I didn’t listen.”
A few cheers.
“You’ve still never beaten me on the courts, though!” Hugh was grinning over his glass.
A few polite chuckles. His way of getting one over me.
“No,” I grinned back, “but you’ve never beaten Lisbon.”
Raucous laughter. That shut him up.

The light lingered, warm against the cold marble arcs of the quiet convent, as I walked in. As my eyes wandered along the neat rows of sun chairs, my nose travelled to the long summer evenings of my childhood, that smelled of sweet popcorn and cotton candy.
I had never been to an outdoor cinema before, so when my friend suggested we go, I jumped at the opportunity. Now, standing here, I was glad I did.
The re-run was the 1999 teen comedy, “10 Things I Hate About You”. A classic “chick-flick” which I have admittedly watched several times before. It’s a light-hearted love story that ends well, and gives you the right amount of 90’s nostalgia.
Before you go off questioning my taste in movies, I didn’t decide to spend 10 euros on this particular occasion for the sake of the film in question. I spent the 10 euros for the experience.
And an experience it was.
From the moment we stepped into the soft afternoon glow of Graça, I was already in my own outdoor movie. Like a dream within a dream.

Discussing Azure, blockchains and… machine learning rap
This past week was quite eventful for me. I attended the school-symposium DATA Science 2018 — in (Astro)Particle Physics and the Bridge to Industry (about which which I’ll have a post soon) during the whole week, but on Wednesday I went to Microsoft’s headquarters in Lisbon for the 5th PyData Lisbon Meetup | Special Edition.
It’s impressive that the PyData Lisbon community has already more than 500 members as there had only been four events beforehand (the first one in last September). The fifth meetup had 200 participants (the maximum that the Microsoft’s auditorium would allow) and for a good reason: the YouTube phenomenon Siraj Raval was in the house!
But before we met Siraj Raval, there was the talk “We ran out of memory” by Silvio Rodrigues and Tim Kock, two of the founders of Jungle AI, a young startup specialized in predictive intelligence. It dealt with machine learning at scale, using the Azure cloud platform by Microsoft to solve problems which cannot be handled by a laptop.
As a beginner in these things, it was fascinating to me to see such large scale machine learning being used in real-world situations. Even though I wasn’t able to follow every single detail, the informality and joviality of Tim Kock kept me engaged in the presentation.
After a small break for some pizza and beer (thanks Microsoft!), it was time to listen to Siraj Raval, with his presentation “AI Networks”, which you can find in his GitHub. He mostly discussed the next phase of the Web, “Web 3.0”, focusing on blockchain technology and decentralized applications.
I’ve only come across Siraj’s YouTube channel a few months ago while I was searching for videos about machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I was very surprised by the enormous number of subscribers. Who knew so many people would watch videos discussing machine learning algorithms and frameworks?
And apparently some of his early videos had him rapping about these concepts! I hadn’t watched any of them, but Siraj was kind enough to showcase his abilities during the Q&A. I confess that that was not what I was expecting to see when I went to this meetup.
Overall, it was an entertaining evening . If you’d like to check, the event was live streamed on Facebook — and, yes, it includes the rap at the end.

In Lisbon, the soul of the city is written in azulejos. These hand-painted ceramic tiles cover the facades of its oldest buildings, shimmering in sunlight and rain alike, whispering the stories of the city’s past. But walk through Lisbon today, and you’ll notice gaps where tiles once clung — empty spaces on walls like missing teeth in a smile. Construction sites pile broken tiles alongside debris, while sleek new developments encroach on neighborhoods that once hummed with history. It’s here, amid the rubble of modernity, that Serra Behar steps in.
Serra, an artist and a neighbor, isn’t just creating art; she’s waging a quiet, poignant battle to preserve Lisbon’s identity. Her exhibition, Autoimmunity and Allergy, now showing at MAD Gallery, speaks to the fragility of the azulejo, but more importantly, to the fragility of the systems and memories they represent. Each azulejo Serra collects — chipped, cracked, or discarded — is a piece of Lisbon’s story that she refuses to let fade away.
The Artist as Caretaker
For Serra, saving azulejos is an act of care. “Each tile I pick up feels like rescuing a fragment of the city’s memory,” she tells me, her tone both determined and wistful. Her work begins on the streets, where she searches construction sites and demolition zones for tiles that have been cast aside. These aren’t perfect tiles — they’re worn, their colors dulled by time, their edges chipped. But that’s precisely why Serra finds them beautiful.
“They’ve lived,” she says simply. And now, they live again through her art.
At MAD Gallery, her rescued tiles are arranged in installations that feel both meticulous and tender. The rawness of the broken tiles contrasts with the clean gallery space, making the viewer hyperaware of their imperfections. “They’re not supposed to be perfect,” Serra explains. “They’re supposed to remind us of what’s been lost — and what’s worth saving.”
Saving Lisbon, One Tile at a Time
Lisbon, like many cities, is caught in a paradox. Its history is its greatest asset, but its future is being built at the expense of that history. Serra’s work grapples with this tension. Through her art, she shows how azulejos — these seemingly small, decorative objects — are, in fact, vital to the city’s identity.
The azulejo is more than an aesthetic flourish; it’s a language. Its patterns and colors speak of Portugal’s Moorish past, its maritime adventures, its religious traditions, and its modernist movements. But when these tiles are removed, the city loses a piece of its voice. The smooth, glassy surfaces of new construction might glimmer, but they are mute.
Serra’s mission is to give those missing tiles a voice again. By presenting them as art, she forces us to see them not as relics but as witnesses. Each crack and chip becomes a story: of the artisan who painted it, the wall it adorned, and the generations who passed by it on their way to somewhere else.
The Skin of the City
Serra’s exhibition title, Autoimmunity and Allergy, is not a metaphor she chose lightly. She compares the removal of azulejos to a skin condition, where the protective outer layer is damaged, leaving what lies beneath exposed and vulnerable. “Tiles are the skin of buildings,” she says. “They protect the structure, but they also define its character. When you strip them away, you expose scars — not just physical scars, but cultural ones.”
Her metaphor extends further. Just as the body can attack itself in autoimmune diseases, cities, too, can turn on themselves. In the rush to modernize, Lisbon has unwittingly destroyed parts of itself, sacrificing its unique character for the sake of progress. Serra’s work asks a pressing question: Can we find a way to modernize without erasing? Can Lisbon save itself from itself?
A Quiet Resistance
There is a quiet, almost subversive quality to Serra’s art. She isn’t staging protests or writing manifestos. Instead, she’s walking the streets of her city, rescuing one azulejo at a time. Each piece she collects is a small act of defiance, a refusal to let history be discarded like construction waste.
At MAD Gallery, this resistance is palpable. The tiles are displayed not as ornaments but as artifacts. Serra has stripped them of their original context, forcing the viewer to consider their fragility and their significance. Some are arranged to emphasize their broken edges, others are mounted to reveal the raw, unglazed sides that were never meant to be seen. It’s as if the tiles themselves are saying, “Look at me. Remember me.”
The Power of One
In a city as vast and complex as Lisbon, the idea of saving it one azulejo at a time might seem quixotic. But Serra believes in the power of small, deliberate acts. “You don’t save a city all at once,” she says. “You save it piece by piece, memory by memory, tile by tile.”
Her work resonates not because it offers grand solutions but because it reminds us of the importance of paying attention. It’s easy to overlook the cracks in a facade or the gap where a tile used to be. But Serra’s art asks us to slow down, to notice, and to care.
An Invitation to See
As I left MAD Gallery, I found myself looking at Lisbon differently. I noticed the patterns on the azulejos of buildings I’d passed a hundred times without a second thought. I noticed where tiles were missing and where new ones had been added in their place. I noticed, too, the scaffolding that seemed to creep further into the city with every passing month.
Serra’s work had done what all great art should: it had changed the way I saw the world. And it had given me a simple but profound reminder — that saving a city isn’t just the work of governments or preservation societies. It’s the work of individuals, of neighbors like Serra, who care enough to save a single azulejo from being forgotten.
For those who haven’t yet visited Autoimmunity and Allergy, I urge you to go. And when you do, take a moment to reflect on the azulejos you see — or don’t see — on your way there. Each one is a fragment of Lisbon’s story, waiting to be noticed, remembered, and, perhaps, saved.

Ah, November in Lisbon, Portugal — what an exciting time!
Now, I’m not just talking about those amazing sunsets, the delicious food, or the stunning buildings and hidden gems scattered around the city.
No, I’m here for something special: the Web Summit.
This massive tech conference is one of the biggest in the world.
It’s a place where you get to learn so much and meet all these amazing people from everywhere, all passionate about technology just like us.
While this year’s attendance wasn’t my first, it was, once again, an amazing experience.
When you attend a conference alongside 70,000+ people, your perspective changes.
Definitely, at one point I felt overwhelmed.
As I took in the surroundings, I considered the newcomers to this impressive conference and the questions likely swirling in their minds:
After pondering these questions, I decided to share a few words about my experience at the Web Summit in Lisbon and offer tips to help others feel more confident at similar events.
No one should leave such events with negative feelings about their participation or a sense of unproductivity. With some preparation, events like the Web Summit can unfold numerous opportunities.
I hope this article will guide you the next time you attend a large event, as it reflects what I wish I had known before going to my first major gathering.
Many Web Summit attendees are first-timers, and it’s crucial to acknowledge this. Beginners might feel overwhelmed in the fast-paced atmosphere and face common challenges of large events, making navigation seem daunting. With 70,000 participants, the event’s sheer size might lead some to dismiss it prematurely as not worthwhile.
However, I challenge that perspective. Events such as the Web Summit offer a phenomenal platform for learning and networking with influential folks from all over the world.
Still, first things first: your journey at Web Summits starts with your phone.
To maximize your benefit from the event, keep a few things in mind. First, make sure to download the event app, but be cautious about its potential drawbacks. While it provides maps, attendee lists, and other details, filtering people or presentations for specific niche topics of interest might be challenging.
Also, carefully consider how much you’ll rely on the app for networking because it is not primarily designed to facilitate engagement beyond the chat feature.
Consider in such an environment: how likely is it that those you message will respond?
Drawing from my personal experience: use the app for navigation, but avoid relying solely on it for engaging with people.
With numerous presentations occurring at the same time, it’s challenging to keep up with all of them. The venue is filled with ongoing presentations requiring constant movement.
In my view, the source matters more than the topic. A captivating title doesn’t guarantee the presenter’s relevance to the subject. I prefer finding relevant people and attending their presentations, regardless of the topic. Feel free to skip some sessions, as content is often repeated.
Consider your participation in the Web Summit as an investment. Approach it with curiosity and passion, asking questions and challenging ideas. Stay open to your peers’ ideas, as there are valuable learning opportunities. Strive to gain something from each presentation session, as this investment will yield dividends over time.
Friendly tip: Web Summit is packed with sessions, events, keynotes, and workshops. Prioritize the ones you can’t miss and plan your schedule accordingly.
And remember: no matter how hard you try, you’ll not be able to attend everything and be everywhere.
My next piece of advice is to schedule meetings in advance if possible.
This is the pre-event preparation phase I mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that first-time attendees may be eager to attend presentations and explore the venue, but meeting with the right people is crucial.
The people you meet at Web Summit could be your future partners, mentors, or investors.
You’ll only have one chance to make a fine first impression.
Friendly tip: At events like Web Summit, excellent opportunities often arise unexpectedly! Don’t hesitate to talk to unfamiliar faces and explore beyond your usual interests. You might uncover something surprising.
A key lesson from my experiences at Web Summit is the value of side events. They’re smaller, and more intimate, and people tend to prioritize building meaningful relationships. Also, make sure to have fun in the evenings. Many see Web Summit as a tech event that doubles as a big party, and there’s some truth to that.
The most valuable connections often happen when people are at ease.
Trust me on this one: feel free to miss a scheduled session for a lively discussion or a significant announcement happening elsewhere. Stay flexible, trust your instincts, and take advantage of chances to talk whenever they come up. Whether it’s a coffee break or waiting for a keynote speech, these unplanned interactions can lead to valuable new contacts.
Web Summit offers unique opportunities to network with individuals you might not have met elsewhere, such as an entrepreneur from Brazil, an investor from Costa Rica, or a remarkable founder from Japan.
Friendly tip: Don’t just focus on sales at Web Summit. Meet people, have engaging questions ready, and show genuine interest in their stories.
Remember Dale Carnegie’s advice: to be interesting, be interested.
If you have a goal for attending the Web Summit, make sure to plan accordingly.
For instance, if your goal is to generate leads or secure funding, take the time to prepare your pitch and craft effective conversation starters.
Also, decide where to focus your time to connect with the right people.
Your goal should determine your tactics.
Copying what everyone else is doing won’t lead to exceptional results.
Friendly tip: Bring plenty of business cards and prepare a concise elevator pitch about yourself and your business/interests. Nobody will dedicate an hour to intros, as time is a precious asset at the Web Summit — use it wisely.
My personal favorite spots:
Stepping into the vibrant world of events such as the Web Summit, it’s crucial to remember that balance is key. If you’ve reached this point, one thing is clear:
There is a lot to think about.
While the conference offers an ocean of opportunities, your success will rely on your ability to prepare and engage purposefully. Simultaneously, stay open to spontaneous connections and seize opportunities on the spot.
You know why you’re attending.
You’re there for a reason.
Keep an open mind and stay curious — a seasoned conference-goer knows it’s the unplanned conversations and unexpected learning opportunities that often create remarkable insights.
Most importantly, enjoy the process. Embrace the grandness of everything, the dynamics, as well as the rollercoaster of ideas and conversations.
After all, the true essence of large-scale events lies in the vast opportunities right in front of you.
Hope to see you next year in Lisbon!

Somewhere new for us to visit. I had been trying to find a location which would hopefully be warm in April and which neither of us had been to before, and being practical, somewhere which was a direct flight away from Gatwick. I was surprised by just how many places that ruled out. And how many places in Spain and Italy are code shared by BA ad require a change of plane along the way.
So I came up with Lisbon. Lots of variables around the dates, leave years, other events we were going to, and so on. So much so the fact that we were going during the week before Easter and all the kids would be off school passed me by completely.
It was a nice, civilised time for the easyJet flight from Gatwick to Lisbon, relatively painless apart from the ten-minute bus journey from the plane in the middle of a field somewhere to the terminal building. The Lisbon metro from the airport was straightforward. And the art in the stations was fascinating, if only I hadn’t got the camera buried away in my bag.
We popped out of the metro station, and it was two minutes to the hotel. For a change it isn’t an IHG one, as they were either in remote locations, or ridiculously expensive and had no points nights available for the four nights we were going to be here. So it is a random Booking.com hotel. Which looks decent enough in the lobby, but they are doing improvements on it. With it being a Booking.com choice we are in a before room. Which very much has an eighties Marbella vibe about it. But it is clean and has a comfy bed and its not like we’ll be spending much time outside of sleeping in it anyway. We’re going to be too busy being out exploring. Which after dumping the bags we were. It was a literal dump and run, no unpacking.
A bit of late lunch and we are off wandering down the city’s main boulevard heading towards the river. There is a market down one side of the boulevard, which we aren’t going to be distracted by, it isn’t a shopping trip. Besides aiming for the river there is no plan.
But as any regular reader will know we are easily distracted and tend to detour off at the slightest whim. There is no master plan for the trip as neither of us had looked at the guidebooks until we were on the plane. Though we have booked the standard hop on hop off bus tickets. As when don’t we?
The detouring didn’t take long to kick in as we saw a funicular off down a side street just a short walk from the main boulevard, and we headed over there for a ride up the side of the hill.
Lisbon is remarkably hilly, and most of them are steep. On the metro journey into the centre there were a couple of times where we popped out from being underground and suddenly found ourselves on a bridge over a valley before popping back into another tunnel.
Anyway, at the top of this funicular run is a short walk to gardens with views out over a lot of the city.
Next to the top of the funicular track is a building with an interesting tower and a spiral staircase up to the top. From which the views would be even better (even if it would be no good for my vertigo), but there is no public entrance to it. So we go back down and rejoin the main drag to get to the river.
A lot of the city was destroyed by a major earthquake in 1755, so most of the lower part of the city leading to the river was rebuilt in the late eighteenth century in a grid pattern, following what they had seen in Paris. They have managed to shoehorn some modern monstrosities in as they do everywhere, but there are some splendid examples of early twentieth century Art Deco buildings plugged into gaps as well.
They quite like a square here. There are some vast open paved spaces which we pass through on the way to the river.
And they certainly like a big old statue. A lot of the time it is a figure high up in the air at the top of a tall column, or as I got to be calling them as the trip went on, ‘another bloke on a stick.’
Anywhere they have a square, or a wide pavement, then they have cafes and restaurants spilling out into them. We are not going to struggle to find somewhere to eat on this trip.
Along one such alfresco dining mecca on a pedestrianised street we can see the grand archway becoming larger with each footstep.
Once through it, would you believe it, we are in another huge square. With a fountain in the middle (they do love a fountain, although not many of them have the water running), and on the other side of the square is the River.
It is the River Tagus (which I’m sure sees lots of people doing a tag us in post on social media), or as they call it in Lisbon the Tejo. At this point it is more like an inland bay. The channel which heads out west from here is wide enough, the massive suspension bridge shows that, but here it is more like being at the coast with it being the sea between you and another country. But it isn’t, that is still Portugal out over the other side of the expanse.
The sun is shining, it is a leisurely late Sunday afternoon and so we stroll along the banks of the river following the sun in going to the west, looking for somewhere to get refreshment. There are stalls along the front. The trend would very much appear to be to pina coladas served in hollowed out pineapples. A bar has a DJ playing next to the water, and in yet another square there is a live band playing traditional Portuguese music.
We find a café on the waterfront near the ferry port (for crossing the inland bay to the cities on the south of the river) in the sun and have drinks. The coffee looks amazing and tasted even better.
It is relaxing watching the people and the variety of boats going by.
We like it so much we stop there to have food. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a menu where one of the dishes have proclaimed themselves as being spiritual, but there on the menu is Spiritual Cod, which Helen ended up ordering.
It didn’t come with enlightenment or a prayer book, just in a dish looking like it was Cod Mornay.
Whilst sat outside the restaurant, another couple on the end table tried to spirit themselves away without paying, but the eagle-eyed staff noticed and ran after them, card machine in hand and got them to cough up what they had tried to avoid paying.
The sun is all but gone by the time we move on. We find we are close to the Time Out Market, so we have a wander through it to have a look. It is full and buzzy with lots of food options and certainly somewhere to think about coming back to on another evening.
We are now heading in the vague direction of the hotel. There are more squares. Buildings are being lit up. There are lots of interesting vehicles trying to entice tourists in for tours. And there are more steep uphill roads to walk up. That is the thing with guidebook maps. They show the roads and the direction they go in, but there is no mention or indication of the elevation of said roads.
After going up for what seems like a long time, we find ourselves at the top of the route of a different funicular. A quick check shows it goes down to the main drag we have walked along from the hotel earlier in the day, so we hop on.
We did know we had been going uphill for quite some time since leaving the banks of the river, but it is a surprise just how far we had climbed as the funicular ride down took a lot longer than we had imagined it would, and than the earlier one had.
When we had been going in the opposite direction earlier, the side of the road we walk along now had been full of market stalls, but they have all packed up and gone, only to leave behind the occasional café or restaurant which had been disguised by the surrounding stalls earlier.
There are lots of billboards up around the city as there had been when we were in Budapest, as there are elections on the way. I know it isn’t the correct interpretation, but I’m not sure I would be voting for someone with a slogan of Zero Future.
What had been intended to be a quick mooch about became six hours. Six very enjoyable hours, but now bed, and rest is calling us as there will be a lot more hours, so much more to see, and difficult food choices to be made for the next four days to come.

Of course, Hybrid Work is not only a campaign to us. Therefore, we want to introduce you to our colleagues that work from everywhere as digital nomads for diconium. Read further to see how Verena experienced her workation in beautiful Lisbon.
“Oh, you worked from Lisbon?” That was a common response to my explanation that I didn’t take a six-month sabbatical in Portugal, but simply moved the home office to the sun.
But back to the beginning: in October 2021, I took my first workation. Two weeks in Portugal — first Lisbon, then Porto — together with my colleague Lena. And that’s when a thought came up: Why not just stay longer? No sooner said than done. At the end of February 2022, it was time: I said goodbye to Stuttgart and boarded a plane heading south. Looking forward to warm spring days, lots of sun and much better weather than in Germany. Nice dream. It may sound surprising, but it also rains in Lisbon. A lot. Until April. But hey, somehow it was still nice to spend this “April weather” somewhere else.

Why Lisbon, you might ask yourselves? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city where you can find everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses, a thriving nightlife, the most beautiful beaches within reach, good restaurants and cafes, relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life. Oh yes, of course we also have an office there. Little has changed in my day-to-day work. The same projects, the same colleagues, even before mostly remote — now I just had to get up an hour earlier. But it still felt easier.
“Why Lisbon, actually? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city that has everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses…relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life.”
The positive attitude towards life and the joy that this city carries also has a positive effect on my work. I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days. Lisbon simply invites you to leave the house also later in the evening, because there is so much to discover and see. And bang — it’s the weekend again. And in good Portuguese style, you simply enjoy it on the beach. You don’t need a vacation for that, it’s just a normal Saturday. Crazy, isn’t it?
“I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days.”
But I want to share something else: The biggest learning for me was how much I miss the physical meetings with my colleagues (even though I can’t count on one hand how many of them made a trip to Lisbon during my stay). Especially after things became a bit more open and dynamic again after two years remote work, I felt like I was stuck in the pandemic for even longer in my daily work life in Lisbon. Although I visited the Lisbon office, I did not meet my colleagues I’m directly working with. Therefore, every visit I made to our offices in Germany during this time showed me again how valuable these face to face interactions are — both on a human level and for the project progress. Just locking yourself and your team in a room for half a day helps move the project forward. And honestly? As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues again regularly.
“As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues regularly.”
Don’t get me wrong, there’s something about sitting in a café on the beach and working from there — provided the internet connection is stable and the noise level is kept in check. Big shoutout to Teams for providing virtual backgrounds! That’s why I’m already very excited about where I’ll be going next and for how long. Because there is no doubt that I’ll be on another Workation. But in the end it is always nice to come back home.

In my previous article for Live View, I discussed the cameras I decided to bring along on a trip my wife and I planned for six months or more. The trip would start from Lisbon, voyage briefly to Tangiers, and then cruise along the coast of Andalusia to Barcelona. I wanted to travel light but be prepared to do justice to the places I would be seeing for the first, and possibly only, time.
Now we are in the midst of that trip. This article is a report on how things have worked out so far for me and my photography, as illustrated by what I saw in Lisbon.
To recap, I brought two cameras, my OM Systems OM-1 and my new Fuji X100VI. For the OM-1, I took two lenses — the 12–100mm F/4 and the 8–25mm F/4. At the last minute, I decided to take my 18mm conversion lens for the X100VI, and I’m glad I did. I originally thought that the OM-1 would be fine for all focal lengths, but it turns out that the X100VI with the wide conversion lens is great for small city streets.
Which I used more. On various tours over three days, including dark interiors and bright streets, I used whichever camera seemed appropriate — I carried both. Counting the results, it turns out I used both cameras equally. Six hundred thirty images with the Fuji, 680 for the OM.
When it came to focal lengths, it turns out I used the Fuji with the wide converter 56% of the time —…

Going down for breakfast we were able to get what looked to be the last two free seats in the restaurant. I’m looking down the room thinking it is rammed and being surprised as it wouldn’t appear the hotel is that big. But there is a mirror across the back of the room, so it looks twice the size with twice the people in it, and it was only my third wander around the room before I nearly walked into myself coming the other way and realised what was going on. (Have I said I’m not a morning person?)
I suppose it could be said I’m the weather jinx. The previous afternoon had been warm, so this morning I leave the hotel in shorts, t-shirt, and wearing sunglasses. So of course by the time we got on the first of the tour buses it was overcast and threatening to rain. If I said it was a little changeable during the day it might just about cover the number of times we changed seats, got undercover, back into the open, back undercover, in the open, downstairs, upstairs, downstairs, on and off.
When the sun did break through it was lovely and warm, but on the second of the three bus tour routes the spit spots turned into a torrential downpour, which coincided with exactly where we had planned to get off the bus and explore on foot.
As with many larger cities there are more than one route of HOHO buses in Lisbon. There are lots of places of interest to see, but they are spread out over a wide area, putting them all on one route would mean an exceedingly long bus tour.
We had decided on the blue route first which was more to the east and north of the city. Besides the grand municipal buildings and old churches it is interesting as to what catches the eye when on the tours. Such as the sex shop in a building with an Art Deco female fresco on the wall.
Or the Lisbon Business Centre being in a low rent run down block with ideas above its station.
The name of an ice cream store.
Or even the former gas storage frames.
The route goes through the part of the city which had regeneration for when Lisbon hosted Expo 1998. And there are some very interesting structures to see.
There is always too much to try and take in and with the speed of travel, or the angle you are at on the bus means that I spend a lot of time when back at home wondering what the hell I was trying to take a photo of.
What is not in any doubt is just how steeply undulating the city is. There are a lot of roads the buses go up which I’d not want to attempt driving a car, especially the angle of some of the red light induced hill starts which would be needed.
After a lap of the blue route, we change to the red route, getting part of the way around before the rain forced us downstairs for cover, fortunately picking seats which weren’t still getting leaked on down there. The viewpoint behind raindrop splattered windows is totally different and the opportunity to take photographs is limited. To zero.
We got off where we had planned to at the Jeronimos Monastery, supposedly where the first Pastel de Natas were ever made. It is in a traffic free zone (apart from the tour buses), and it is surrounded by museums. (And parts of the monastery buildings have been converted into museums.)
It is properly tipping it down and so we head into a packed Maritime Museum café for lunch. There are map related items to buy in the gift shop, without having to go into the museum, so always good. And whilst we had been lunching the rain had stopped and the sun was trying to escape the cloud cover.
Only for the rain to come back the moment we step outside. But we are used to rain, and we carry on and have a mooch about, through gardens, under the road and railway and to the riverbank and the immense Monument to the Discoveries on it.
In front of it in the square is a map of the world and on it are places highlighted with dates of when the Portuguese empire arrived there during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries following the footsteps of its famed explorers Vasco de Gama and Ferdinand Magellan.
We are heading back under the road and rail when Helen feels someone close up behind her. There is a woman pawing at her backpack and saying, ‘sorry it was open.’ It most definitely wasn’t the woman was blatantly trying to rob Helen. Fortunately, the front pocket was only full of tissues, and her phone and purse were at the bottom of the main compartment buried under lots of other stuff like a jumper and scarf. But whilst checking there was nothing missing the woman and her sidekick had scuttled off as fast as they could and were nowhere to be seen when we were back up at street level. The would-be thief may have got fuck all, but it did shake Helen up and meant she was reluctant to use the backpack as a backpack for the rest of the day and was ultra wary about anyone being close behind her at all.
It began to brighten as we continued to wander around Belem, but we didn’t stop and pick the bus back up at the same point, instead we ended up walking back towards the large suspension bridge.
This meant a detour over a footbridge spanning the road and railway and out onto the roof of one of the MAAT buildings, giving a good view of the other older one.
And of the suspension bridge, built to look like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, it is painted in the same plum colour paint (which is the best colour to be seen in the fog), but is a bit shorter.
Behind it on the hill on the south of the river is the statue Christ the King, like a smaller version of Christ the Redeemer in Rio, more like Christ the Reduced. They do like a copy.
The bridge is called the April 25th Bridge, a nod to the 1974 revolution. It had been shrouded in mist when we had come past it on the bus earlier.
We walked back to under the bridge before reacquainting ourselves with the HOHO bus tours, retracing part of the route we had done before (downstairs in the dry at the time), and past the Belem tower.
Another shower forced us back undercover, and moving back out from the cover just happened to coincide with passing the Basilica, one of the more spectacular churches of the city, and I missed the chance to get a photo of it completely.
Before the loop was complete, we jumped off to change to the green route for a couple of stops to get us up the steep narrow winding streets to the castle. It is easy to see why this route uses a minibus. The route certainly makes me want to reiterate my reluctance to ever want to drive on these streets in a car.
The plan is to get to the castle so that we can catch the 5pm walking tour included with the HOHO tickets. Which we just about manage.
The tour guide in Guilherme, and he is from Brazil, and is doing the tour in English and Spanish, which just blows my mind as I can only just about manage the one language, and even that needs to be carried around in a bucket most of the time.
From the high point next to the castle entrance we have a slow meander down to the river stopping at key points to have things pointed out and for little pieces of the history of the city imparted to us.
One is at the statue of St Vincent (patron saint of the city),
And the viewpoint down from the plaza there, over the terracotta roofs to the river, and across to the church of St Vincent on another hill,
And the dome of the National Pantheon housed in a former church.
We pass a tree which looks like it roots have escaped from the soil and are on an acid trip induced adventure.
There is a quick poke inside the cathedral (which we are likely to return to later in the week).
And then it is down to the river side, stopping at the spiky house.
And finally into the Commerce Square in front of the grand arch, which we had passed through on our little stroll the evening before.
It was a good tour, lasting a lot longer than the advertised hour, and there was even a recommendation of a post tour restaurant for dinner. Which had massive portions of lovely food at reasonable prices. Such sized portions it was probably a good idea there was a walk back up to the hotel involved afterwards.
Those twelve hours had flown by. Time for rest and to get ready to do it all again tomorrow. More buses and a boat tour to come.

There are few things more iconic than leaving rainy London in search of sunnier skies — only to land in Portugal to find… more rain.
Welcome to Lisbon, land of seven hills, centuries of charm, and one of the soggiest weekends I’ve ever had. And somehow, it was still magical.
We arrived bright-eyed, hopeful, and wildly underdressed. The UK, of course, had decided to be 22°C and sunny that weekend, while Lisbon greeted us with a torrential downpour.
After squelching to our hotel, Portobay Liberdade, we regrouped and, now lightly towel-dried, swam our way to a nearby Italian spot (Il Basilico, I think?) for a bite. My travel companion’s trainers were instantly soaked, turning a casual stroll into a mission: Operation Waterproof Shoe Hunt.
Easier said than done. Lisbon’s got many things — views, wine, vintage tiles, but trainers shops? Not in a monsoon.
That first day? Honestly, a washout. But then, we stumbled into dinner. And let me tell you, it was a revelation.
After drying off from our soggy adventures, we chose to dine in our hotel that night at Bistro 6, and it was one of the most fantastic choices we made. The duck was remarkable: Crispy on the outside, tender and rich on the inside, with a wonderful depth of flavour present in every bite. It was so good that even in a city as full of culinary gems as Lisbon, we couldn’t resist going back for round two. I’m pretty sure I’ll be daydreaming about that plate for years to come.
By morning, we gave in to our fate. Lisbon was going to soak us, and we were going to like it. Jackets on, umbrellas up (luckily supplied by the hotel), optimism renewed.
First stop: the Mercado da Ribeira (aka Time Out Market Lisbon). Our first-ever Time Out Market and it set the bar high. It wasn’t your typical chaotic food court, instead, it felt like a well-curated space with an incredible variety of options. From fresh seafood and gourmet croquettes to decadent handmade chocolates, there was something for every craving. The place was organised yet vibrant, buzzing with energy.
If you’re new in town, it’s the perfect place to meet people: everyone sits together, it’s lively, communal, and thriving.
We grabbed a doughnut (incredible!!), a couple of coffees, then wandered through the traditional market tucked behind the main hall. Fishmongers shouting, locals shopping, fruit stacked high, there was a real sense of the city coming to life. We were completely captivated.
Next, we set off to see Lisbon Cathedral (Sé) and try our luck with Tram 28, Lisbon’s charmingly vintage and famously packed transit option. While we waited in the drizzle, we were approached by a charismatic Parisian tour guide, offering a covered tuk-tuk ride through the city.
Usually, we’d run from that kind of pitch, but he had a roof, plastic sides, and an irresistible charm. Reader, we climbed aboard.Best decision of the trip.
He took us through the seven hills of Lisbon, shared history with passion, pointed out hidden spots we’d never have found on our own, and gave us time to really enjoy the views, not just tick them off a list.
Oh, and at our very first miradouro (viewpoint), someone proposed right next to us. Cue tears. Lisbon, suddenly, wasn’t just rainy — it was romantic.
We ended the day at Praça do Comércio, where the weather finally gave us a break. Picture this: three grand golden-yellow façades on three sides…and then, nothing. Just open sky and the wide, rolling Tagus River, looking more like a calm ocean than a river. It was one of the most unexpectedly stunning squares I’ve ever stood in.
With a glass of wine in hand and the wind finally drying our coats, we toasted to Lisbon’s stubborn beauty.
Sunday morning brought us to Belém — land of custard tarts and monumental queues. Our attempt to visit Jerónimos Monastery failed (read: misunderstood the queue and were politely turned away), but fate had better plans: we headed early to Pastéis de Belém instead.And thank everything holy we did.
This place is a Lisbon legend. From the outside, it looks like a pleasant café. But inside? It’s a labyrinth of awning-covered rooms, waiters by the dozen, and pastries by the thousands. Somehow, we snagged a table.
Between the two of us, we ordered at least six pastries — custards, almond cakes, an orange thing I can’t explain — and two coffees. The bill? €10 total. I don’t know how. I don’t care. I would’ve paid triple.
We even brought some back to the UK with us. That’s how good they were.
We wandered through Alfama and Old Town Lisbon on our last day, taking in the steep streets, the tiled walls, the laundry flapping above us. If I can give you one travel tip for Lisbon, it’s this:
Do not come with a new hip. Or bad knees. Or any aversion to steep climbs.Lisbon is beautifully vertical. Like, mountain goat vertical. My poor mum (fresh from hip surgery) was a trooper, but fair warning: this city is cardio with a capital C.
So, was it the sun-soaked European weekend I imagined? No.Was it a glorious, rain-drenched, pastry-fueled, unexpectedly beguiling adventure? Absolutely.
Lisbon is a city that sneaks up on you. It’s tiled facades and rooftop views, ghost stories in ancient cathedrals, and secret tarts tucked in glass counters. It’s fascinating markets and quiet moments, and unexpected friendships with French tuk-tuk drivers.
It’s a city I’ll absolutely come back to, preferably with better footwear, a lighter raincoat, and the same appetite for surprises.

I love reading fiction, writing when the mood strikes, and pottering outside when the sun comes out. Love art, travel, and catching a West End show when I can.

With the sun beating down on me and a temperature of over 28°C, I see a fellow runner lying on the curb being attended to by first responders. I check my watch and decide to stop once again at the next water station. This is going to be much tougher than I expected…
My journey to the 2017 Lisbon Marathon started in the winter of 2015. I was busy assembling IKEA furniture when I was struck by a burning pain in my knee that refused to go away. For the next few days it continued to get worse and every small stair suddenly became a major challenge. Finally, I decided to see an orthopedist. I never really liked (or had much reason) to see a doctor, but I had just turned 45, my girlfriend Anna was pregnant with our daughter and I figured getting it checked out would be the responsible thing to do.
The visit ended with a referral for an MRI that led to a nasty surprise. The cartilage in my knees was considerably damaged. These injuries had been looming for some time as I continued to ignore the warning signs. The diagnosis was clear. I would now be required to get a sodium hyaluronate injection directly into my knee joints every 6 months just to ease the pain. An injection with a price tag of $750 that isn’t covered by any health insurance. To add insult to injury, the doctor casually said, “Look, you may be able to go for a 5-kilometer jog, and you should do that regularly, but nothing longer. Take it easy, you will never be able to run a marathon, so don’t bother trying.” These comments resonated in me for a long time. I never even considered running a marathon — until this very moment.
I have always seen myself as a member of the running community, but frankly, my laps through the park had become less frequent over the years. There was the occasional spring onset of daily runs that lasted for about a month, but they were never farther than 5 to 10k. The longest distance I had ever run was a 25k race but that was only once and it was over 20 years ago. So, I could have been content with injections twice a year and back to a rather normal life. Only that I wasn’t.
The most urgent issue I wanted to focus on was the pain. I started reading a lot about treatment options and I decided to try something other than getting needles jammed into my knees. After a bit of experimentation, I found that taking a high dose daily (2000 mg) of glucosamine sulphate was starting to help me. Later, I added omega 3 and collagen to the mix. After a couple of weeks the burning sensation went away. I had indeed found an alternative for my battered knees.
Please bear with me, in one of my former lives I was also a lawyer: This is what worked for me, but no medical advice whatsoever is intended.
The following year I wasn’t really prioritizing my running career. Throughout all of 2016, I covered a total distance of less than 60 km in twelve runs. Yes, I had a lot of other things on my plate, with a newborn baby, being CEO of Berlin’s Innovation Agency and everything else. At least I was sticking to the doctor’s advice when it came to the part of “taking things easy” with my knees. But I had a growing sense that I was missing something. I was somehow able to manage getting everything done — but I was also realizing that I was losing my edge.
New Year’s Eve is always a great time for resolutions. In the years past, I must admit (and you can probably relate), these intentions were rather short-lived. But this time I was hell-bent to make a change for real. So I came up with something that seemed utterly beyond reach: For 2017 I resolved to run a marathon. And to make things more interesting, I didn’t even consider the Berlin Marathon in my hometown. I was looking for a venue with added value. I soon found Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, located at the River Tagus and the Atlantic Ocean, one of the most fascinating cities in Europe. With the race scheduled for October 15th, this would leave me enough time to find out if my knees would keep up with my ambitions.
The first thing I did was to read about marathon training. There are many manuals and programs out there. The takeaway lesson was: Run frequently, consistently including workouts for speed, stamina, and mobility and run a reasonable number of longer runs that should include a 30+ km run in the weeks before the event. This means you must spend a lot of time and you must spend it regularly. Marathon training is an exercise in discipline and commitment, that much I realized. Wait, I only had time for two handfuls of recreational runs in 2016 and (what I thought to be) insufficient sleep due to our baby’s somewhat erratic sleep patterns, a demanding job and, last but not least, a relationship to cherish. Sounds like something straight from the playbook of Mission Impossible, doesn’t it?
Nevertheless, I came up with a plan. I set 2 milestones that would serve as my intermediate goals: The 10k City Night race in Berlin on July 29th along the famous Kurfürstendamm Boulevard and the Stadtlauf Berlin half marathon on August 20th. If I could complete both within a reasonable time and my knees would be functional afterwards I would book the flights to Lisbon. After registering for both races, I started running 5 kilometers on January 3rd along the icy shores of Schlachtensee Lake, which would become my favorite route for the next couple of months.
With the marathon still in the “distant” future, the winter runs that followed were a bit sporadic. Eventually I had to figure out how to fit my training into my daily routine and the only solution I came up with was to get up early. And I mean really early, at 4:30 am.
There has been a lot written about the benefits of starting your day off early and I must say, it’s totally true! Starting your work day after you have spent some time working out is great. Having a daily sense of achievement after logging 10 or 20 km before you start breakfast is truly awesome. Having the chance to focus on your thoughts while enjoying the sunrise is priceless. So, over the next few months, I was running regularly and enjoying the slow and steady progress I was making.
Both tests I recklessly scheduled quite close to the big day went well, so I booked the flights and a very nice apartment in Lisbon’s historic Alfama district. Finally, it was going to happen. I would run at the Lisbon Marathon!
In the final week before the race one issue became increasingly pressing — the weather forecast. When I had the idea of flying to Portugal for my first ever marathon, I of course checked the weather information. On average you can expect 20°C in the middle of October. But not this year, the forecast was 31°C with clear skies. The 2006 Chicago Marathon had to be shut down with the mercury at 28°C but I expected that in sunny Portugal this wouldn’t even be considered. So, I frantically worked on adapting my gear. It is a good thing that you reduce your training miles leading up to the race (a.k.a. tapering), so you can take care of these kinds of things.
However, speaking of reduced miles, another question started nagging me. Did I train enough? Even though I ran nearly every day in the weeks prior to Lisbon, I never ran a distance longer than 25 km. But on the other hand, 15 km was one of my regular morning runs, so the additional stretch should be manageable, right? Since there was no chance I could redo my training plan in the next few days, I decided to relax. The race day would prove if my reasoning was right.
I arrived Thursday evening in Lisbon to acclimate myself and focus on the challenge ahead. It was a luxury to have time to think and I enjoyed doing so at the marathon’s designated finish at Praça do Comércio. Here, you have a wonderful view over River Tagus’ final passage before joining the Atlantic Ocean. It became my “vision quest” as my girlfriend Anna would call it. She has always been supportive of my aspirations. Although we originally planned to make the trip to Lisbon together, Anna decided to stay at home with our young daughter and this gave me the gift of time alone. I used it well and came up with a list of goals and dreams for my future.
Finally, the day of the race dawned and I was sitting on the train from Lisbon to Cascais jammed with marathoners in various degrees of contemplation. Some were sitting on the floor with an empty look on their face, others were chatting happily away with their running buddies or texting home. I was silently rehearsing my game plan: Stick to the well-trained pace of 5:30, don’t get carried away by competing with other runners in the first 20 or so km, pick up the pace at 30 km aiming at a negative split, finish sub 4:00 hours.
And I stuck to the plan, at least for the first 20 km. After crossing the starting line in a wave of euphoria I was soon running steadily. I found the waving flag of the 4 hour pacemaker I was going to follow until the half marathon mark and the first misting station was in sight.
Then something unexpected happened. The heart rate display on my watch jumped to an unreal 202 bpm and I forced myself to slow down. Around 175 bpm would have been the “normal” maximum for a person of my age. Today, looking back at the data, I’m sure that this reading was erroneous because I have never again gone over a 170 bpm. At the time, I only had the information on my display and it had a tremendous impact. I suddenly realized that I still had another half marathon to go and the sun was beating down mercilessly even though it wasn’t even 10 a.m. yet. I checked my knees for any signs of pain or weakness. Had I overestimated myself? How could I have believed that with only months of training I would be able to pull this off? I already envisioned myself collapsing at the roundabout near the beach of Carcavelos.
This was the point where I was (to be honest for the first time really) awestruck by the magnitude of the marathon as a test of body and mind. I considered my options. I could stop now and justify it with the parching heat and my staggering heart rate. But in the end, I decided to follow through, no matter what. My goal had changed. Certainly, I still wanted to finish with a time that would be to the best of my abilities, but I mainly focused on not being defeated. I would slow down, I would drink whenever possible, I would even walk any uphill stretches of the course. The reason I started this endeavor in the first place was to prove to myself that it was still possible to accomplish something really demanding and to push my limits. This would become my mantra for the next kilometers to come.
And those kilometers weren’t easy. In fact, I never experience the famous “runner’s high”, at least not while I was running. The last 10 km became an uncomfortable rhythm of moving along an agonizing 2.5 km stretch only to reach the next water station, drinking and cooling myself, and starting all over again, but it worked. After I had passed the 40 km mark the number of cheering spectators increased significantly. That gave me the final boost to give the backup goal I cooked up with while poking along the torrid Avenida Marginal a try: Finishing at 4:30.
With a final sprint I reached the finish line at 4:30:54!
After hitting the stop button on my sports watch I felt exhausted but otherwise amazingly good. No cramps, no sore muscles even in the days following the race. Interestingly enough, the knees that brought me there also carried me throughout the whole distance without any problems. So, on a physiological level, it is safe to say that the stress I put on my body was easily absorbed.
The marathon had both a short and long term impact on my psychology as well. It all started with the continuous effort I put into my training despite all the seemingly “good” reasons why there wasn’t enough time. Once I made up my mind and committed myself to the marathon, I magically found ways to make it happen. I was able to build up my knees by training and through supplements with no side effects based on the research I did. I was able to regain my confidence and mental strength on a very fundamental level. And I was able to apply all of this to master the challenge the Lisbon Marathon turned out to be.
After I had taken a cold shower in my apartment and devoured a carb-laden lunch, I immediately went back onto the streets of Lisbon for a walk. I noticed a shift in my perspective that is still present today. A lot of things suddenly felt shallow and dispensable, others became much more significant, like sharpening the focus of my mental map. And I started working towards reaching some of the most important goals that I had identified just days before.
So, it once again proves to be true: Every cloud has a silver lining. When I got the news of my supposedly ruined knees, it seemed to be the end of my running days. But instead, this was just the beginning! It has forced me to make decisions about how I want to live my life. I opted for the challenges and that has allowed me to grow beyond my athletic ambitions. You gain nothing by accepting your fate, you must keep on fighting if you want to win.

Lisbon is a city of seven hills. And I am the queen of one of them, for three days. But if I go down a hill, I must climb up again.
The charm of Lisbon is its narrow lanes and endless steps lined by colorful azulejos (tile) covered buildings. The beauty of Lisbon is its hills and plentiful viewpoints with panoramic views. To climb these hills, you’d need good food to fuel your stamina. The good news is, delicious food is everywhere for every budget.
Since we had been to Lisbon once many years ago, this time we decided not to cram a tourist checklist into our three-day stay.
We were first captivated by the sweeping view from Miradouro de Santa Catarina (Viewpoint of Saint Catarina), within a short walk from where we are staying. The grand Tagus River and the red tile roofs beneath glow in the warm sun, and Christ the King statue stands tall in the distance across the river. Both locals and tourists enjoy having a drink at Noobai rooftop bar and restaurant. We didn’t have a chance to catch the sunset there but it is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view. There is also…

When I was first thinking about moving to Germany, the appeal was pretty clear: Germany is an economic powerhouse, one of the strongest economies in the world. I thought to myself, “Okay, if I move there, I’m making a smart decision for my career.” And even though Berlin wasn’t exactly my first choice, I figured it would work as a starting point.
Fast forward six years, and I’m feeling stuck both personally and professionally and I’m starting to question the environment I’m in.
Feeling stuck? I wrote about why settling in one place can actually be dangerous for your growth. If you’re curious, check it out here: Why Settling in One Place Can Be Dangerous for Your Growth.
But, let’s get to the real reason I’m writing this post: Lisbon.
I recently visited Lisbon for the first time, and let me tell you, I was shocked in the best way possible, I was still taken aback by how much I loved it.
The streets were clean, the infrastructure was solid, and public transportation actually worked well enough to make getting around a breeze. But what really stood out to me was the overall vibe of the city. It just felt… ordered.
There was this balance of modernity and tradition, Lisbon had this richness that Berlin doesn’t always capture, at least not in the same way. It’s not just in the food and the gorgeous architecture, but in the way the city feels. The people were welcoming, the atmosphere felt peaceful and grounded — everything just felt a little… livable.
The streets didn’t feel unsafe or disorderly, and I didn’t have to dodge random bottles or step over anything unpleasant. It felt clean — and not just physically, but in terms of its overall atmosphere. Lisbon felt way more laid-back and balanced — a place where I could actually imagine calling home.
On my way back to Berlin I find myself wondering… could Lisbon be the place for me? Maybe it’s time to seriously think about it. But … As much as I’ve dreamt about moving to Lisbon, my hopes have taken a bit of a hit.
Lisbon used to have a reputation for being more affordable than other European capitals, but the reality is, rent prices have been climbing steadily — especially in the trendy neighborhoods — bringing them in line with cities like Berlin!
On top of that, salaries in Lisbon are still pretty low compared to other European cities, so the cost of living isn’t as balanced as I once thought. It’s a bummer, but looks like my dream of settling in Lisbon it didn’t last too long!
So here I am again, chasing the original plan moving to Munich. Although is one of the most expensive places to live in Germany, at least the salaries are around 30% higher than what I’ve been offered in Berlin!
But even with the potential for a bigger paycheck, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just stuck in this loop of chasing after cities that are becoming increasingly expensive while the job market still feels a bit of a mirage!
The whole “Germany has tons of job opportunities” narrative is, well, not exactly the truth. Anyone who’s actually lives here knows how tough it can be to land a job, even if you speak German at a C2 level. The competition is fierce, and sometimes it feels like it doesn’t matter how qualified you are.
Sure, the western and the southern part of Germany is still financially doing well, but if the job hunt keeps feeling this grim, it might just be time to explore other options. It’s a tough decision, but I’m honestly getting a little tired of hitting dead ends. I’m even starting to entertain the idea of leaving the country altogether.
Sadly, Lisbon will remain in my heart as a city that surprised me and gave me some amazing daydreams of a life where I could see smiles around and feel a sense of calm in the everyday. It’s the kind of place that makes you think, “This could be home,” but sometimes, reality just doesn’t align with those dreams.
I’m thinking about where to go next. I’ve got some exciting options on my mind, if you’re curious, check it out here: I’m Leaving Berlin. Let me know your thoughts!

Shannon is behind one of Lisbon’s coolest coding school: Le Wagon. We met at Beta-i and got curious to know more about her story and how you start such a project from scratch without being from the city yourself. Time for some questions!
I moved here four years ago to be with my boyfriend who is from Lisbon. I never imagined at that time that I would still be here four years on, but the city has been changing (for the good) at such an alarming rate in the last few years that I feel like I moved somewhere new.
Rather than why I came to live here, the better question is why I stayed. And to answer that, you can read a blog post I published a few weeks ago on Le Wagon — Why would you relocate to Lisbon?
www.lewagon.com
Le Wagon is a code school for non-technical entrepreneurs and creatives. We give people the programming and product development mindset through teaching ruby on rails web development.
My motivation to launch Le Wagon started two years ago while I was working in a local accelerator/ incubator here in Lisbon. I saw a lack of technical talent amongst the founders and also felt that I could benefit myself from understanding on a basic level what is going on behind the scenes of software.
Now, after having gone through the program myself and already running three 9 week batches in Lisbon, I can say I know that and a whole lot more, plus have 60+ Lisbon alumni as a support when it comes to launching my own products and finding cool jobs in the tech market.
Growing very quickly with a very diverse mix of internationals and locals.
We really wanted to be immersed in Lisbon’s startup ecosystem and Beta-i was a great way to access this community.
We could do a better job of this to be honest. At the moment, we are cross promoting events and of course enjoying some impromptu beers on the roof :)
Learning how to learn (again) — their EGOS! As humans, we are conditioned to shy away from challenge. We want all the glory with all the ease. We tend to work in areas and take on tasks that make us feel good. The first three weeks of Le Wagon are an ice cold shower for those that are not accustomed to just not getting something in the beginning. You really have to have faith in yourself and our curriculum when you start the program. The concepts are abstract for most people and they need to time sink in. Le Wagon is like learning to ride a bike. You have to be willing to keep getting on the bike and falling off and trust that eventually if you do that enough times, it will click and you’ll start riding.
To keep the students believing in themselves and their ability. To keep “falling off the bike”.
In our first batch, we had a student that really struggled. And when I say struggled, there were days he didn’t finish a challenge. But the guy had a great attitude. He didn’t give up. He didn’t compare himself to his classmates. He just kept going. After the bootcamp, he was one of the first to get a job and not even in ruby — in Javascript on the backend! He is our mascot here in Lisbon on what it means to give it your all.
Our community is growing locally. We expect in the next year to have our own space with our own cowering for our alumni and ruby on rails developers.
Thanks Shannon for your time and insights!

Here at Salsify, we can’t stop talking about our brand spankin’ new office and team in Lisbon, Portugal! We do love Boston, but nothing can top the beautiful sunny weather and gorgeous beaches of Lisbon. I recently got the chance to sit down with our People Operations Specialist in Portugal, Marta Carvalho, to get her take on Lisbon, Boston, and all things Salsify!
Q: So, what exactly does a People Operations Specialist do?
A: As a part of the People Ops team, it’s my responsibility to promote employee engagement and brand awareness, onboard new hires, support HR processes, team building, and a lot of other fun stuff! Since we are just getting started in Lisbon, my current work is very focused on building and growing the Lisbon team, and ramping up the Salsify employment brand in Lisbon.
Q: How long have you been working for Salsify?
A: A little over one month.
Q: How did you find out about Salsify?
A: I heard about Salsify coming to Lisbon through networking in the Lisbon tech community.
Q: What made you want to work for Salsify?
A: The opportunity to do what I really love in a company with great culture and values. It’s great to be part of this project since the beginning. Plus, I have the opportunity to be a pioneering person in HR and to think, implement, and see through the best policies and procedures!
Q: What is it like working for Salsify versus working for a Portuguese company?
A: For me, the possibility of traveling and working in collaboration with Boston colleagues on a daily basis is something that I really love. Plus, Portuguese companies tend to have long and inconclusive personal meetings! I’ve been struggling a lot with this in my last years :) I’m delighted that things at Salsify are done promptly, on time, and focus on specific goals. I feel that people here are very productive and efficient.
Q: What is the biggest cultural difference that you’ve encountered between Portugal and the United States?
A: Well . . . you all seem to have lunch and dinner pretty early :) I’m used to having dinner by 9 pm for instance while in Boston, it was super common to have dinner by 6 pm. It feels like days and nights in Portugal take longer.
Q: What has been your favorite and least favorite thing about working for Salsify so far?
A: Favorite thing is probably the possibility to work with such a great and friendly team. Least favorite thing is the current temporary office, which is about to change when we move to a new office full of windows and sunshine!
(We actually just moved to our new office! Check it out here.)
Q: Are you someone who can listen to music while you work?
A: Only during some tasks. If I’m doing some sourcing or replying to some emails, then yes. If I need to think about something more strategic or write down policies and procedures, I can’t.
Q: Where in the world would you most like to travel?
A: There are so many places I would like to go that it’s hard to pick out only one. I love sun and beaches, so anything that seems like a paradise are good destinations (Hawaii, Bahamas, Bali…).
Q: Do you have a hidden talent/fact that most people don’t know about you?
A: Well, I dance a lot of Salsa and Bachata. I’m not sure if it is a talent, but it’s something I love to do and I know how to do it.
Q: Tea or coffee?
A: Coffee for sure. Not a fan of tea, only drink it when I’m sick. Tea does not bring me good memories :)
Q: Reading or watching TV?
A: Both. Love to see a good movie or also to do some binge watching on Netflix. However, also love to take a book to Starbucks (yes, Starbucks is very appreciated in Lisbon!) or a nice coffee shop and read it on a rainy day.
Q: What is your favorite thing about Lisbon?
A: What keeps me in Lisbon is definitely being close to my family. Also, our sunny days, good food, and great sights to see make me love Lisbon. What I like the most is the possibility to go to the beach in fifteen minutes from my home! Even in winter, the sun stills shines here and you can have a good time on a nice terrace on the beach.
Q: Best lunch spot in Lisbon?
A: There are so many. Food in Lisbon is the best. I like to go to Portugalia, in Belem (but more because of the space rather than the food).Q: You recently visited the Boston office! Was this your first time in Boston? How did you like it?
A: Just loved it! It was my first time in the US and I was delighted. The first few days were pretty tough. Never felt so much cold in my entire life! But I loved to see the city with and without the snow. You have a beautiful city and compared to Lisbon, everything is so big. I felt very welcome by the whole team and got really impressed about how big we are in Boston. Looking forward to create something similar in Lisbon.
Q: What are you most excited about moving forward?
A: I love the creation processes of everything. So, very excited about creating the Lisbon Team and to set all things for the creation of our offices as well.
Obrigado, Marta, for letting us get to know you and Portugal a bit better! Check out our careers page for more info about all of our amazing job openings, and be sure to follow us on Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter for all the Salsify updates you could ever want.

Haven’t joined Medium yet but still want to read my story? Fine. Click Here
This was a museum that caught my eye when we did our ‘buzz through’ visit to Lisbon in February. Portugal has a centuries long maritime tradition for exploration, military and commercial enterprise and since world history is a subject I’m a little interested in, I put it on the list.
We came back to Lisbon near the end of March and after quite a little bit of ‘what do we want to see?’ conversation, we purchased the 72 hour Lisboa Pass which offers free or discounted admission to dozens of attractions.
Located in the Belém district, home to an amazing number of interesting attractions, Museu de Marinha, also known as the Maritime Museum or the Navy museum, is on the list with a 20% discount. So, instead of 7€ (US$7.65 at the time) we were admitted for only US$6.13 each.
The museum is located in one end of the Jerónimos Monastery building, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which is an attraction on its own. One we didn’t visit, BTW.

Let me tell you a story. This one takes us to Lisbon, Portugal, where I went to visit someone who has been my fairy godmother and her amazing husband. To protect her privacy, let’s call her “Ballerina.”
Now, Lisbon was everything you’d imagine, great people, great food, and endless opportunities to learn. Between physics, entropy, mountains, ballet, and Portuguese culture, my mind was buzzing. But, as always, the universe had a peculiar surprise in store for me. You see, Ballerina has this friend, Karma, who happens to be a Tibetan Buddhist Kempo monk. Yes, his name is as amazing as his wisdom. One day, we decided to head to the beach for some sun and sea after I met with folks from the World Bank to brainstorm ways to tackle water scarcity. Pretty typical day, right?
Well, here’s the twist: monks don’t usually carry swim trunks. So, what do you do when your monk friend wants to dip his toes in the ocean? You go and buy him a pink swimsuit, of course. Armed with this purchase, we made our way to the water, chatting about life, music, and whatever else crossed our minds. Turns out, Karma had spent some time in Mexico and spoke Spanish. This led us down a hilarious rabbit hole of Latin music, culminating in a spontaneous rendition of *Despacito*. There we were, a cosmologist, a Buddhist monk, and a theoretical physics PhD student, on a Portuguese beach, singing and dancing to a reggaeton hit. Life’s surreal moments, I tell you.
But wait, there’s more. I’m not exactly an ocean person. I grew up in the Andes, far from any sea, and I didn’t realize how quickly the water could chill me. As the sun set, my body temperature dropped fast, too fast. Ballerina, who, by the way, is not just an award-winning cosmologist and a ballerina but also a seasoned mountaineer, immediately noticed something was off. Her mountaineering instincts kicked in, and she got me out of the water before I turned into a human popsicle. After almost giving her a heart attack with my near-hypothermic state, we bundled me up and made it back home safe.
That trip wasn’t just about beaches, physics, or even *Despacito*. It was about being in the company of some of the most brilliant and fascinating minds I’ve ever met. Karma, in particular, taught me so much about the art of controlling the mind, meditating, and navigating emotions with clarity. It was like a crash course in mastering the internal chaos we all carry.
But more than anything, this trip reminded me of the simple joy in life’s beautiful chaos. The cliff, the mountains, the black cat, the dreams, the tree, the hedgehogs, the sunset, each a little piece of the puzzle. Between deep conversations, fresh ideas, and hours spent playing with their incredible kids, I felt myself rediscovering the wild, curious, and playful side of me. It’s the part that often gets buried under all the equations and theories, but it’s always there, waiting to come alive again.
Life’s better when it surprises you, isn’t it?

It was a nightmare to leave the “Estação Oriente” in Lisbon.
After spending a delightful few days in Porto, I boarded the AP train, eager to return to Lisbon.
The trip took me 3 good hours that I spent writing and communicating with my laptop. The train wifi was working properly.
However, as I arrived at the Lisbon train station (Aug 5), I found myself in an unexpected predicament.
The bustling station was packed with an ocean of people from all corners of the globe, and a wave of claustrophobia washed over me.
I felt in some ways lost and unsure of how to reach my hotel via the subway train.
Navigating through the sea of travelers proved to be a daunting task.
Each person seemed to be in a hurry, and it felt like the entire world had gathered in Lisbon to witness a momentous event — the Pope.
Feeling overwhelmed, I took a moment to compose myself and tried to spot any sign or direction for the subway.
However, it was not easy amidst the crowd. And every escalator was not working.

Two black socks hang from plastic clips above the Travessa da Cruz do Torel, an alleyway in Lisbon. I cut through the Jardim do Torel on the way to my favorite park. Yet I’ve never been this way, turning right instead of left when exiting the garden.
I lean upon the golden wall, taking in the details of the surroundings. Slanting shadows carry shade and slice the buildings into softer, darker tones.
High above the buildings, above the wire and the socks, sits the pale, subdued moon. I can’t fathom what it is — what it physically is — dust, rock, an assortment of matter. What I see, perhaps, isn’t dust drifting into darkness; I see something like a stone, patiently waiting to shine.
I can conceptualize a stone. When I look into the sky, it’s like a rock beneath a moving river; is that not what it is?
Later it’ll change, morph into a sphere of light, glistening from afar.
Its emergence means that night is falling, and that feels good. I feel the change of weather, the chilling of the breeze.

Having been woken up by an unpleasant noise I hear every morning Monday through Friday, I peeked at the darkness still reluctant to get up and saw nothing but furniture shapes. This time, I was quite thrilled to kick off the day because in just a few hours I would walk the streets of a city I never thought I’d visit.
Fast forward a couple of hours, a few airport checks and check-ins and one transit flight and I was finally there. Oh yes, and my arm was sore from carrying a few suitcases (thanks to my girlfriend), with that feeling of exhaustion as if coming home after a whole day’s work and a mediocre meal and no leg space for a 190-cm guy which caused me to twist and turn in my seat. But that’s the economy class ticket benefit you don’t get anywhere else. It is the airport company’s fault but I do often get — “Well, why are you that tall?”
Other than these minor inconveniences, the flight was good. I was here. Stepping out of the plane and walking for a change was a true remedy. I heard a whispering “Thank you” from my back and knees as I was willowing towards an airport exit.
Outside, palm trees dwarfed every building around it as they stood proudly, defying gravity. Above, the clear sky was chasing away the dark clouds that gathered in the night to water the city. They knew Lisbon was awaiting guests. The air was quite refreshing and it filled my lungs with energy after every breath. Comparing it to the cold Belgrade air, which is best felt with the scarf wrapped around your mouth, was pointless. It was a true marathon to get to the destination, yet I was more than eager to get the tour started. I couldn’t wait to see what the city had to offer.
The spring sun was shining bright. It is one of those days where you take your jacket with you, but it is warm enough during the day and you don’t need it. If you sit down, you can feel the wind creeping up your shirt sleeves, giving you goosebumps. So with my jacket on and off and on and off again, I was strolling the old parts of Lisbon.
Each building, house and structure of any kind, whether historical or not was a story for itself thanks to the bright blue, yellowish and white tiles covering it. The tiles, called azulejos, were used as decoration, but also to protect the buildings from the salty river and ocean air. It is the first thing that catches the eye, together with different kinds of tiles laid under your feet. Those painted pictures of ships, seas, winds and other things on the squares, streets, and sidewalks.
Walking through the city street I was faced with the dilemma to look down and up, as vibrant colors were everywhere with tiles reflecting the sun, giving you the warm and cozy feeling of familiarity and admiration.
It took me a while to fight against the hilly terrain to get to what I consider to be the main square — Praca do Comercio. It offers a marvelous view of the Tagus river which shows its full power exactly at this place, pushing the coast to the sides, stretching out as much as possible. One might be tricked to consider this to be the sea, partly due to the pleasant breeze coming at you. However, it is just the spot where you can see the full power and potential of nature, as the river narrows down a bit further “down the road” before it collides with the vastness of the cold and blue Atlantic. Seagulls are flying around, their song mixing with the people murmur and tram’s racket.
A few tiny white sails were seen on the river, while across, the remaining parts of the city are calling you to explore them, with much more greenery and sparse buildings.
The welcoming atmosphere invites you to sit on the curb, even in one of the surrounding cafes and just soak in everything around you. And that’s what I did. The sounds, the smells the view. It is all one needs to know about a city to recognize its soul, and it didn’t take me long to see Lisbon as my own.
As the sun retreats, the tiredness due to miles of walking and exploring caught up with me again, but just like upon the arrival, it was mixed with pleasure and peace.
And the sunsets…true Lisbon colors show up, the ones you cannot see during the day. With the remains of the day, the rush is over and satisfaction is painted on every face you encounter, tourist or local.
Sleep catches with you quickly when you lie down. I cannot remember what happened, but it was morning again. And that awful alarm sound, although it felt better this time. Getting down to the hotel lobby by elevator felt a bit painful due to aching in my legs, yet there was no choice. The city was calling me out to turn every corner, see every tile and smell the air from hills and valleys.
Alfama is a city within a city. I decided to walk across it and it was a mistake from the start. Uphill and downhill terrain made this area specific, with no flat parts. To me, it all seemed uphill, especially after a few hours. Luckily, you can get on the vintage yellow tram which is one of the symbols of the city and ride up, before you get off and walk uphill. Again. Endless elevation. And just like the other areas, Alfama is colorful and vibrant but there’s something special about it, something mysterious that I couldn’t define.
My stomach started complaining, which meant that the entire itinerary changed and the first place I wanted to get to was the restaurant. Suddenly, all those historical places became “meh” as human biology stepped in.
Lisbon is a perfect city for fish lovers. Fish is all over the menus and all I desired at that point was salmon — and boy, oh boy, it was terrific. Add a squeeze of lemon on top of it, with a fresh salad as the side dish and it is a perfect combination. No bones to pick just a light yet fulfilling meal.
While all of that was happening, a fado trio was playing the background, a local band, performing here and there, and it was all that was missing. They hit the right note as the sun was setting over Alfama.
The moment I landed at the Belgrade airport, I was happy to be home, yet sadness filled my inner being. The city was grey and colorless, with people rushing all over the place, going in the wrong direction. It was cold outside and the cold reached all the way to my bones. I already missed the sunny hillsides and building tops, the uneven grounds and the atmosphere which seemed to be more welcoming.
I was back in my everyday routine. Yet, on every cloudy and misty day, I remember the Lisbon sun, shining bright!
Until we meet again!

Three days in June
I went straight toward the Tagus River walking across the shopping. This is the ""Parque das Nações"", Lisbon.
Recently I made a trip by train from Porto to Lisbon.
The Alfa pendular comfort 1st class is easy and tranquil.
It takes almost 3 horas from Campanhã station in Porto to Oriente station in Lisbon.
The train has wifi you can work during the trip. I felt a little dizzy and had to stop my work.
When arriving in the city… the Orient station is connected to the Vasco da Gama shopping mall and the metro station.
If you take the subway the first thing anyone will notice is the art poetry and murals of the metro stations. They inspire people all day long.
On the wall written in Portuguese on blue azulejos (tile art)…
""A verdade que eu conto, nua e pura vence toda grandiloca escritura."" Luis de Camões, Os Luziadas.

Nestled along the banks of the Tagus River in Lisbon’s vibrant Parque das Nações district is the Vasco da Gama Tower, an architectural gem that marries Portugal’s rich maritime heritage with contemporary design.
Rising to 145 meters (476 feet), it is the tallest structure in Portugal and a symbol of the city’s forward-looking spirit.
Named after the famed Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the first European to reach India by sea, the tower embodies the adventurous spirit that propelled Portugal to the forefront of the Age of Discoveries.
Its design is inspired by the billowing sails of a caravel, the iconic ship that carried explorers like da Gama to uncharted territories. This homage is not just in name but in the tower's silhouette against Lisbon’s skyline.
Designed by architects Leonor Janeiro and Nick Jacobs in collaboration with the engineering firm SOM (Skidmore, Owings & Merrill), the Vasco da Gama Tower was originally constructed for Expo ’98, the World’s Fair hosted by Lisbon in 1998.
The event commemorated the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama’s voyage to India and spurred significant urban development…

A new chapter. A new adventure.
Lisbon has slowly but surely won me over. It’s a city where I’ve decided to pause and settle for a while, despite the numerous considerations that influenced this decision. Now, I’m excited to share my journey in Lisbon, including my discoveries of its food, cafes, and various other delights.
This isn’t my first experience living abroad. Before Lisbon, I spent six years in Izmir, Türkiye, which was no small stint, especially since I moved there when I was just 18. Now, I’ve chosen to continue my journey in Lisbon, though the future might see me moving elsewhere or perhaps returning to my home country, Indonesia. For now, Lisbon is my home, and I can’t wait to explore and share its wonders.
Visiting Lisbon as a tourist, I found the city to be incredibly charming and lovely. However, by moving here made me realise how hill-y this city is! I arrived in September, at that time it was still pretty warm — maybe around 30+C, I was sweating all the time!
Surprisingly, I’ve adapted! I’ve learned to control my breathing, maintain a steady walking pace, and navigate the public transportation system, which has helped me avoid excessive walking and sweating — obviously 🤣. Now, I can truly appreciate all that Lisbon has to offer, both its beauty and its challenges.
Coming to Lisbon without knowing Portuguese has been surprisingly manageable, as most people here speak English. However, this convenience has made me a bit “lazy” about learning the language — I think I took it for granted somehow. Despite this, I’m starting to learn Portuguese, albeit slowly, and I’m doing my best to speak it as much as possible. Even though people in restaurants, cafes, and other places often ask me to speak in English instead, I appreciate their understanding of my struggle to even form a single sentence 🥹
Like many European countries, I don’t have particularly problems on finding Asian foods in Lisbon. There are some restaurants which are pretty good, however I am still in the mission finding the best ones here. Beside Asian cuisines, there are other lots of foods choices. I have my favourite bagel place, coffee (even the overpriced one 🤣☕️), and local food like Francesinha (I like this a lot!). I will make different writings about it — Lisbon food review!
Surprisingly, there is a big Asian supermarket here, quite close with the airport and decent pricing. Mostly products from China, but they have quite variable options from Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese. As I am Asian myself, having this HUGE supermarket is a blessing! 😇
There are foods that I am quite familiar here in Portugal which is pretty similar like in Indonesia, they have different fillings — like Risoles, Croquete, and some biscuits (like cat-tongue, etc).
So, food culture in Portugal is quite rich. I don’t think I ever have food shock here in extreme ways! Don’t worry if want to move or live here, your stomach will be fine and full too 🍽️
Diversity is a thing here in Lisbon, I think it is nice to have such a diverse community. People are surprisingly warm and friendly tho. According to the European Commission’s survey about Quality of life in European cities in 2023, 94% population agreed that the city is a good place to live in general. For me in general, Lisbon is a safe city. Obviously like another cities in the world, there are sketchy neighbourhoods and crimes, but I found in general is pretty safe. So far, I don’t have negative experiences here.
I think I’ve written quite a bit here, so I’ll wrap it up for now. There’s much more to share about Lisbon, so stay in touch! More stories to come. See you soon!

In February of 2016, I started a new experience in my life. I was cast as the leader of a team (a team of two, at the time, including myself, though having grown a lot more since then…) that would work with a US company.
Almost two years have passed since and now it’s time for a new challenge. It’s also time to reevaluate the time and experiences taken from it.
First things first. For the first few months, I will try to minimize any disruption as best as I can. In the beginning, I’m all about understanding everything that’s in and around the company. How they work, who the people are, and how they get along together. Understanding how they think helps me to adjust my discourse to something that would be more familiar to them, more inline with what they’ve come to expect so far.
I’m always careful with my first interactions. I have seen many times in my life people coming along and, in attempting to be helpful, start right away trying to fix any issues that may come their way. In my view, this approach, while sometimes needed, is rarely successful. People will usually see it as a source of disruption. You won’t have a full understanding of the problems or how they came about, and how they have tried to solve them in the past.
So I start by listening. I listen to interactions, I try to understand inside jokes, understand what worries they might have ( big or small ) on a personal and professional level. I usually try to avoid making any major decisions without understand all of the problematic.
Before this, I only had the experience of working with people that mostly were beside me or at least within the same city. When presented with this challenge I immediately identified two important issues — Not sharing the same space and different timezones. I started to read a lot about remote working, and even though most of it referred to individuals rather than a team setting, the underlying principles still apply, so I could already see some issues that we were bound to face.
So how do you connect and work with people taking into account these possible issues? You communicate! You over communicate! You spend a lot of time talking to be on the same page.
Communication will also help when different cultures are in play. I spend some time understanding not only how they are as individuals, but also the cultural traces in their personalities. And whatever I didn’t understand I would ask. An expression, a feeling, some sarcastic remark, or jokes that I didn’t get… I much prefer to ask than sit there guessing.
I found a great team with awesome individuals on the client side. When we came onboard, with us being an offshore team, it is easy to start setting up a divide between people. Us and them. Them and us. Fortunately, the client is amazing and they had the same way of thinking as I did!
They gave us company emails. We had access to the same communications channels as them. We got access to staging and production servers. We got t-shirts! They treated us, and expected from us, the same as any person in their company.
No one gains from one side being treated differently. For me, the only way for this to work as best as possible is through letting the offshore team be completely integrated with the process/spirit of the client. Of course, there’s a large component of trust involved, but with this kind of attitude, they’ll gain people eager to help since they share the client goals and view them as their own.
It is important to note that this is something that needs to be addressed on both sides and is a never ending story, a continuous and ongoing effort. It can happen naturally, but you also have to create and nurture an environment where people can continue to grow and feel valued.
Sometimes you will make mistakes… I believe it’s not a matter of if but when. You will have an unexpected behaviour, or you will introduce a bug in the system. At some point in time, you will do something that’s not in the greater plan of things.
What are the next steps? Tell the truth! Admit your mistake.
Maybe they will understand, maybe they won’t. One thing is for sure though, you will grow and strengthen the bonds that everyone shares. I see no harm in making mistakes, the problem is when people don’t admit to them.
From the first day, I try to remove any dependency on us that the client might have. If I see something that might create a dependency I try to plan how to remove it. Are we the only ones with knowledge on some part of the platform? Let’s pass that knowledge on to someone on the client’s side. For some clients we’re the only source of technology on their team. When that happens we have to be extra careful and try to complement that with a better knowledge base on the tech side of things.
I do the same on a team level ( I’ve written about that subject in a different blog post ), so I apply the same principle. “Isn’t it great for business if I create dependency?” — I hear you ask. Of course it is, but that isn’t the way we work. We want people to work with us because we are great at what we do; not because they are shackled to us due to an over-reliance on what we know.
This was a great experience! The things I’ve learned from working with a different country and timezone; for a different culture, with different views, is something that has helped me to grow immensely! Sharing knowledge and views and understanding the culture was an awesome experience.
If you have any comments or feedback on this subject, I’d love to hear from you!
Nowadays I’m working in my own company trying to bring some products ( like https://isdown.app ) to life. Besides product development, I love to build and scale engineering teams. If you have any questions, feel free to ping me on Twitter or LinkedIn or just leave a comment.

By sheer luck, we arrived in Lisbon during Festa de Santiago Antonio (The Feast of Saint Anthony). This month-long celebration of Anthony of Padua (who is actually not the patron saint of Lisbon but is preferred by the locals) sees the city transform into a spectacular carnival. The streets are decorated with colorful ribbons, street food stalls are packed into every open corner, cold beer flows from the taps, and the air smells of grilled anchovies.
Saint Anthony is also referred to as the holy matchmaker. During each festival, 16 lucky couples get to wed in a lavish ceremony!
We spent most of our days in Lisbon walking and eating, eating and walking. Since Lisbon is known as “the city of seven hills,” it was easy to work up an appetite. Even coming from San Francisco (which is quite hilly) we were impressed by the steepness of several streets. To address the challenges of getting from point A to B in the city, many of the steeper streets have funicular trains ready to ferry people up and down the hills.
We treated ourselves to the street food stalls on many many occasions…
Our host also shared his cooking with us!
On our third day, we took the ferry across Tagus Bay to the city of Cacilhas and followed an abandoned road along the water. This road eventually led to a statue of Christ the Redeemer, a monument inspired by the one in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. This statue (inaugurated in 1959) was created to express gratitude that the Portuguese were spared the worst effects of World War II. It also looks over the April 25 bridge…which looks awfully familiar to the one we just left behind.
In 1775, one of Europe’s most powerful earthquakes hit Lisbon (estimated to be between 8.0 and 9.0). The earthquake struck during a holiday morning and did catastrophic damage, killing an estimated 60,000 people and destroying 85% of the city. Subsequent fires then burned in Lisbon for over 6 days and a tsunami with waves over 20 feet hit the shore.
The pic below is from the Alfama neighborhood. This neighborhood is one of the oldest in the city having been spared the worst of the earthquake damage.
Sadly, 5 days weren’t near enough for Lisbon (or Portugal obviously)! Hoping we will return!
Olá- hello
Obrigad(a/o) — thanks (the o or a depends on the gender of the SPEAKER… confusing for my Spanish-oriented brain)
Saúde-cheers!

Kristina, I am glad to meet you and am simply enchanted by your artworks — I cannot find a better name to describe what you do. Let’s start from the very beginning. Your passion for photography and your first creative steps took place… Where and when?
I was born and raised in the southern part of Ukraine. Since I was a very artistic child, my parents used the opportunity — they introduced me to all kinds of creative expression: painting, music, dancing. I was fond of seeing the beauty of the moment and at some point, — around age 7–8 years old — when my grandparents bought one of those first digital cameras, I started taking photos. Just shooting everything I saw around — mostly nature. Of course, not all of the shots, but some, made my grandpa admit “Oh, she’s a good eye!”.It was the very beginning of my photography path. Hence, shooting nature still attracts me — it is a way of meditation and a source of inspiration for me.Another way of expressing my mood and showcasing creativity was artistic shooting with a good friend from my school. We used to dress up and invent themed photoshoots, crafting all the details from scratch with our own hands — they were important — and incorporating a touch of aesthetics to each picture.Finally, I kept forgetting and belittling one important point — my photos were displayed in a town hall exhibition in my hometown. It was literally the whole exhibition of my photographs. Talking about it now, I feel goosebumps.
So nature was your primary shooting experience. What about developing your eye and style? What kind of photography mostly attracts you now? What would you call your favorite style and does it allow experimenting?
Since humans are a part of nature, I love shooting portraits and body portraits. Now I will explain myself better. When I take a photo, I try to capture the expression so that the dialogue between the person and their sensations is seen in the picture. There is much more than face and body when it comes to seeing body language. I find gestures, movement, shapes, and sights even more important than the primary image, clothing sets, and surroundings. I like minimalistic photos, which speak to people’s hearts more than to their brains and eyes. However, aesthetics are very important to me — I always see it in details and (people say) am good at showcasing it.
Is there anything really special for you during the photoshoot? Something you can never omit.
My point is using the photoshoot as a therapy. It is an intimate process which I can really compare to a confession. The camera sees a lot. However, I have 3 main rules for any shooting to take place smoothly. Before we shoot , we need to meet and have a talk over a coffee or tea, or whatever. It helps the person to open up and feel more comfortable.And the second thing is that the person should understand what they feel like during the process. It is essential, as the sensations and feelings cannot be hidden once snapped with a camera. That’s why I need the first step of meeting before the shoot — so there is no intimidation, but freedom and comfort.Rule number 3 is putting myself into the model’s shoes from time to time — it makes me understand how a person in front of the camera feels in different situations. In case I realize there are some points making me uncomfortable as a model, I avoid them in my own shoots.
Are there any taboos for you? What would you never shoot?
My principle goes far beyond any taboos — I try everything at least once. Otherwise, how would I know if there is something I like or I don’t like? Every kind of art is unique and it might make you come up with some deep ideas — it will make you broaden your skills or knowledge.I am pretty much philosophical in this aspect. Everything can take place, unless it is your own experience telling you that you don’t like it.
An idea as your motto during your lifetime? Or a couple of them…
In my opinion , there is always something going on in life which can change our perception, our opinion , and our principles. So there is no constant definition of what guides me in life other than changes. I guess there is a saying that the only permanent thing in life is change. And this is what I totally agree with. The strategy can change according to your goals, your values , and your sensations — and it would be a very poor decision to follow only one rule for the whole of your life.

In Lisbon’s Mouraria, the birthplace of a legend.
Fado (“Fate”) is Portuguese “Blues” music born in the slums of Lisbon in the 1820s…Well, that’s the kind of intro you might expect to read in an article about Fado. To our surprise, flaneuring through the winding streets of the Mouraria in the oldest part of Lisbon, Teresa and I discovered the actual birthplace of the woman whose music marked the emergence of Fado from the shadows into the light.
The plan for the day, in as much as there was one, was to start at the Chapel of Our Lady of Health, at the bottom of the Mouraria, wander through the backways until we got hungry, and then find our way to Zé da Mourari, a traditional Portuguese restaurant that Teresa particularly wanted to try.
The chapel was built as an appeal to the Virgin Mary for her to intercede with God and save the city from the plague, which ravaged Lisbon during the 16th Century. The crowned statue of Mary at the front of the chapel is still paraded around the neighborhood once each year in thanks for her deliverance.
Just behind the church, the roads zigzag up and along the hillside towards Sao Jorge Castle, through the Mouraria, one of the few parts of the city that survived the earthquake of 1755. The name means “Moor-area.” It’s the old quarter of the city where the muslims were confined after the Christian reconquest of Lisbon in 1147. Because of its narrow winding alleyways and crooked streets, The Mouraria remained a magnet for outcasts. It attracted a rougher crowd of immigrants, sailors and sex-workers. Now it’s just starting to emerge as a rather hip part of Lisbon, while still keeping its authentic character.
Strangely enough, as we soon discovered, many of the immigrant in this neighborhood today are from Bangladesh — the new muslims who are welcomed to Portugal. It’s obvious not only from the restaurants and stores with Bengali signs, but also from the colorful men’s sarongs hanging out the windows to dry with the laundry. Even the graffiti and street art has a Bengali flair.
We wandered around until our feet got sore, then headed in the general direction of the restaurant. The road narrowed, then widened into a tiny square with two trees loaded with oranges in the center. The houses here were old, not more than two stories, with some of the doors laughably tiny. The artwork on the walls was playful yet beautifully done. We were captivated.
The walls contained some clever visual jokes, like this woman blowing miniature ballerinas towards a cat…
And this door with a poem scrawled next to it that reads: “I want my love/There is no other/I want my love/There goes another!”
We noticed at the far end of the little square a gleaming white building that seemed almost out of place in the scruffy but well-decorated little square. A sign on the building explained that this square was named in honor of Fado legend Maria Severa, who was born in this house in 1820 and lived in this neighborhood.
Her father was a gypsy, her mother owned a tavern and was a sex-worker known as “ Barbuda” — the bearded one. Maria, however, was great beauty by all accounts, and perhaps unavoidably fell into her mother’s profession. She sang early Fado songs in the taverns and brothels of the Mouraria. According to one source (Lisboa, a Love Affair), she was the first person to sing fados in the street, accompanying herself on guitar and composing her own lyrics. She sang about her life and her problems: love and heartbreak, betrayal, jealousy, revenge, tragedy; the same problems as the people she lived among. Her style of Fado became wildly popular. Indeed, one has to wonder if strands of this acceptance of hardship that will break the soul might have gone all the way back to the moors left to fend for themselves on this hill.
There are no portraits of Maria, but here are some descriptions written by various writers who met her: (with thanks to my source Atlas Lisboa):
Writer Luis Augusto Palmeirim: When I entered Severa’s house, a modest dwelling of the vulgar type her unlucky peers inhabit, there she was, smoking, leaning back on a straw couch, wearing polishing slippers dotted with red twine, a silk flowery kerchief on her head and the sleeves of her dress rolled up to the elbows. She was a rather swarthy, thin, nervous woman, remarkable for her magnificent peninsular eyes. On the gaming table laid a guitar, the inseparable companion to her triumphs.
Poet Bulhão Pato: It will be difficult for another Severa to appear, haughty and impetuous, so generous as ready to punch the face of whoever would act rogue on her! Brave, full of affection for the ones she cared for, as well as rough to her enemies, She was no ordinary woman, you can be sure of that.
One of her lovers was the Count of Vimioso, a “bohemian” aristocrat who used to take Maria out to bullfights. This gave her exposure beyond the Mouraria. She was hired to sing at parties in high society, and her reputation grew. Tragically, Maria died of tubuculosis at the age of twenty six. However according to Lisboa, a Love Affair, what she really died of was a broken heart, because the social difference between her and the count was never going to allow a marriage between them: “She actually died poor and abandoned, of tuberculosis, in a miserable brothel on Rua do Capelão, on November 30, 1846…Her last words are said to have been: ‘I die without ever having lived’ — She was 26 years old.”
Something in her music had quickened the heart of Lisbon. Fado had changed because of her; it became this powerful expression of desire crushed by fate. Because of Maria, Fado moved from the shadows into popular culture. Her life became a legend, then the subject of a novel, then a play, which in 1933 was turned into the first Portugese movie ever made with sound.
As Teresa and I strolled from the little square that bore the legend’s name, I thought about the shrines to these two Marias, just a few short blocks from one another. The people of Lisbon loved the Virgin Mary because she saved them from their fate. They loved Maria Severa because she sang about their fate. She transformed their sorrow into more than simply suffering. She made it into something beautiful and holy.

Liberty IT thoughts and tech stories on technical leadership, digital transformation and agile software delivery.

TLDR there were some interesting talks at remote Web Summit this year, but the real value of Web Summit is the ad-hoc meeting and chatting with people, seeing what startups from across the world are working on, and seeing just in general what the tech world is up to. All of which is much more difficult remotely.
Last week I attended the Web Summit tech conference for what I think was the 6th time. I went two or maybe three times in Dublin (I must be getting old if I can’t remember my conference visits!), twice in Lisbon, and now once from the comfort of my MacBook in Kildare.
You can read previous reviews of my colleagues and I’s trips — 2017 here and 2018 here, and they’re obviously quite different from the experience this year. Going to Lisbon was of course part of the fun, but even when it was in Dublin and I just had to walk across the road from my office in Ballsbridge to the RDS, being there in person was infinitely better.
Most talks at tech conferences are interesting at best, boring at worst, but rarely have anything revelatory; for the most part you are unlikely to hear anything you didn’t know already. AWS re:Invent being the obvious exception, where they launch new services at the event — but even with these you can always watch the repeats online afterwards.
One advantage of Web Summit however is the sheer scale — it is huge, with more talks running in parallel for several days than you’d ever get to see — so when it was held in person there are always diamonds among the rough, and if a talk isn’t that good you just stroll over to another one. Remotely however it was difficult to stay focused on the talks, and trying to find the good ones, when work and real life were also competing.
Throughout the three days, even though I’d kept meetings to a minimum, I found myself working on my current project and sending emails more than I spent “at” the conference. It was hard to justify to myself postponing working on an important new feature for watching something online; I always feel pressure to deliver in work, and when I wasn’t actually in a different country at an event, it felt slightly wrong to be sitting there watching talks when I could be building.
There were some exceptions — I saw a great talk by Siemens’ Carolina Alves & Francisco Freitas on using machine learning to recognise dangerous driving in traffic. Their talk was a detailed and honest account of their work, how they gathered and labeled data (a hackathon!) and more. AI and ML is already becoming so important to business, and I love seeing real-world examples like this of putting it into practice.
I saw another refreshingly honest talk, again also by Siemens (Aymeric Sarrazin and CTO Peter Keorte), about IoT, where even though the title was “How IoT will change the world”, they discussed how there is still a lot of work to be done before happens and that IoT is an enabler of change, as oppose to the change in itself.
I attended others which were good also, and I had a lot marked down in my schedule, but I found myself missing a lot of them as I got distracted by my “real” work.
Most of my time at the physical Web Summits was spent just wandering around the huge halls, browsing the startup stands and chatting with people if something looked interesting. Most of the big outfits also had stands, usually with an interesting piece of tech to try out — like in 2017 when I got to try out a quick development tutorial on the HoloLens:
This year there was none of that, at least for me anyway. I was contacted by a fair few people looking to have a “virtual coffee”, and it’s always good to meet people, but these were mostly sales pitches. I missed the casual conversations, seeing companies and projects that I wasn’t expecting to see, and the learning which comes from being immersed for a few days in all things tech.
Web Summit used to have organised pub crawls aswell, which as well as great for seeing more of beautiful Lisbon, was another fun way to meet and network with people from across the world. The most networking I got done this week was with a 2 year old who loves trying to mash my keyboard as I’m working.
I’m hoping the world can return to some level of normal next year and the Web Summit and other conferences can return to what they were, but this year’s won’t be making the top 5. Or is that 6?
I have to mention that I’m fully aware that being stuck at home and not enjoying a few days in Lisbon is not in any way hardship; I’m safe at home, with a great job that allows me to attend events like this, remote or otherwise.
I’ve friends in healthcare who risk their lives every day for the rest of us, so any complaints here are not real complaints, I know how privileged I am to blogging about tech conferences!

This is true! I’m in Lisbon multiple times a year and my Uber from Oriente to the clinic I visit always traverses this circle. Lisbon is 100% a non driving city for me. Down in the Algarve where we live, we joyfully drive. Great piece!

Lisbon is a must visit while traveling to Europe. It is a very affordable city compared to most in Western Europe, but doesn’t skip out on great food, excellent site seeing, and amazing shopping.
My Experience
After graduating college in the Spring of 2022, my girlfriend and I took a month long trip to Europe. Our final destination was Lisbon before flying back to Miami. Let me just say, it was a great way to end our trip on a high note.
Food
Lisbon had some great eats everywhere we went. I would say a big highlight was TimeOut Market. This was a huge food market in which you had the option of any kind of food you are in the mood for. Everything we tried here was delicious. We also made sure to try Portugal’s famous pastry, Pastel de Nada, at multiple locations. This sweet treat with some espresso was always an amazing way to start off the day.
The biggest food standout of Lisbon was a slice of chocolate cake, see below. This is easily the best cake I have ever eaten in my life. I would travel back to Lisbon just to have another slice. If you ever visit Lisbon, eating this cake should be the number 1 thing to do on your list.

There is something perplexing about attempting to express oneself in any language. This issue becomes more salient when what we are trying to articulate is an experience rife with a mosaic of sentiments too complex to comprehend outright, let alone to transform into words. The constant urge to do so, though, does not emerge out of nothing. Our compulsion is primarily driven by an inexplicable urge to dress fuzzy pre-conceptual experiences in words that we understand in order to be able to share them with others. In an attempt to capture fleeting experiences we have, we might try everything at our disposal to grab on to, and subsequently frame, memories that seem to make our lives more colorful, in hopes of chiseling ourselves into becoming interesting individuals not only vis a vis ourselves, but also in the eyes of others.
We encounter such an interesting example in the novel Night Train to Lisbon written by the philosophy professor Peter Bieri under the pseudonym Pascal Mercier. At the very beginning the protagonist of the story (Raimund Gregorius), a teacher of classics at a Gymnasium in the city of Bern, Switzerland, has an encounter which would forever change his life.
On his way to school, Gregorius meets a lady wearing a red coat standing on the Kirchenfeld Bridge, ready to jump and end her life. No sooner than Gregorius realizes this than he rushes to try and stop her — and he does so successfully. She later on accompanies him to school, and along the way he learns that her native language was Portuguese.
As banal and mundane this happenstance might seem, it was sufficient to turn Gregorius’ life upside down in a way he wouldn’t have imagined.
The experience itself might have had nothing to do with the radical decisions he would subsequently make, but it definitely played a rather crucial role in the abrupt shift that would see him embarking on an odyssey of self-discovery and transformation.
Experiences of this calibre tend to instigate us to brusquely but intentionally decide to change the course of our lives as a consequence of an inevitable outburst due to the endless, unconscious, accumulation of selves that one keeps hoarding with the passing of time.
One day we think we’re going to start a new job at our dream company, the other we find ourselves doing something we wouldn’t have imagined doing not in a hundred years time. Change is infinitesimal and can be very difficult to discern. Crossing a certain threshold, we look in the mirror and understand that we cannot recognize ourselves anymore. Where does this dissonance come from though? Why is it too difficult to ‘go with the flow’, to give in to the uncertainties of life, and incorporate change as a core feature of life? These questions present themselves in their blinding clarity when on a day like any other Gregorius is stricken by a sudden realization that he did not know who he was anymore.
In a fate-like circumstance, Gregorius knew that something was different the second he met the lady in red standing on the bridge reading a paper under the rain. Somehow this event made him decide to leave his stuff behind and walk away from school without looking back.
Driven by a curious desire to plunge himself into the unknown, the initial contours of the rebellion against his previous self materialized in the form of breakfast, which he left intact, at a hotel’s restaurant where he had never been before.
After that, he visited a Spanish library that he used to frequent. The concatenation of events led him to stumble upon a book, written in Portuguese, left behind on a table by a customer. The encounter with the lady in red was still haunting him, and it seemed to him that the pieces of the puzzle were coming right into place.
Gregorius knew that the compass of his exciting new endeavor was pointing in the right direction when the first paragraph, which he made the owner of the library read and translate for him, said the following:
“Of thousand experiences we have, we find language for one at most and even this one merely by chance and without the care it deserves. Buried under all the mute experiences are those unseen ones that give our life its form, its color, and its melody. Then, when we turn to these treasures, as archeologists of the soul, we discover how confusing they are. The subject of contemplation refuses to stand still, the words bounce off the experience and in the end, pure contradictions stand on the paper. For a long time, I thought it was a defect, something to be overcome. Today I think it’s different: that recognition of the confusion is the ideal path to understanding these intimate yet enigmatic experiences. That sounds strange, even bizarre, I know. But ever since I have seen the issue in this light, I have the feeling of being really awake and alive for the first time.”
It was a passage that resonated strongly with him, so much so that he decided to jump on a train to Lisbon to track down the writer of the book titled A Goldsmith of Words by Amadeu de Prado. De Prado, as Gregorius would eventually figure out, was a medical doctor who had helped treat one of the central figures of the Salazar regime. Motivated by a sense of guilt at having saved the Butcher of Lisbon’s life, he decided to join the resistance in penitence for his ‘sin’.
In a sense, Gregorius was on a journey of self-discovery that was primarily guided by a curiosity to learn more about the biography of Amadeu de Prado. Perhaps, he thought to himself, he would know more about himself by getting to walk in the shoes of someone else. During the ‘search’, Gregorius had the time to contemplate and reflect upon himself by recalling important episodes of his life when he had to make crucial decisions, and to imagine alternative scenarios in the case that he had chosen differently. Deciphering de Prado’s book, he thought to himself, he would be able to authentically know himself more profoundly.
However, two things scared Gregorius during the quest made more than anything else: 1) falling unconscious because of recurrent episodes of dizziness, which he thought, could cause memory loss, and 2) seeing any doctor whom he didn’t know because fearing that the doctor would make him lose himself.
This latter was a major source of concern right before getting some medicals done following the advice of his Ophthalmologist. “What if they find something bad? Something that would make me lose myself?” Gregorius asked him.
Gregorius’ dealt with his terrible hypochondria-like fear by finding recourse in the static, dead languages of the past, like ancient Greek and Hebrew. However, one of de Prado’s reflections cited below, prompted him to reexamine his views.
“Maybe it’s like this: I’d like to rearrange Portuguese words. The sentences that would emerge from this new order must not be odd or eccentric, not exalted, affected or artificial. They must be archetypal sentences in Portuguese so that you have the feeling that they originated directly and from the transparent, sparkling nature of this language. The words must be as unblemished as polished marble, and they must be pure as the notes in a Back partita, which turn everything that is not themselves into a perfect silence. Sometimes, when I am feeling more tolerant about the linguistic morass, I think, it could be the easy silence of a living room or the relaxed silence between lovers. But when I am totally possessed by rage over the clichéd use of words, then it must be nothing less than the clear, cool silence of outer space, where I make my solitary way as the only person who speaks Portuguese.”
For Gregorius, the passage felt like a call to return to the basics of a language in order to reinvent it in an attempt to capture the concreteness of life experiences. The result, as de Prado suggests, would be an ‘unblemished, laconic text’; a language that, while not completely new, succeeds to express beautifully the essence of inner experiences.
De Prado’s reflection underscores a human necessity to continuously renew oneself like a chrysalis throughout different stages in our lives.
Externally, this idea manifests in the form of excessive consumption. Buying the latest model of any product seems to satisfy a lurking desire to periodically renew and revitalize ourselves.
Internally, it manifests in the form of a constant struggle to articulate the mounting change in our idiosyncrasies which according to de Prado and Gregorius, can be achieved by waxing lyrical in the hopes of capturing our concrete experiences through a genuine discourse rather than by alluding to concepts or languages long dead.
This is echoed by Amadeu de Prado’s reflections where he asserts that expressing oneself anew can be achieved by twisting the language to resuscitate faded concepts in order to make them adapt to our continuously evolving life experiences.
Unfortunately, this struggle never ends because as Nietzsche, who had a fine grasp of this interminable dance, eloquently writes:
“Alas! what are you, my written and my painted thoughts! Not long ago you were young and malicious and full of thorns and secret spices- you made me sneeze and laugh- and now? You have doffed your novelty, and some of you, I fear, are ready to become truths, so immortal do they look, so tediously honest! And was it ever otherwise? What then do we write and paint, we mandarins with Chinese brush? Alas, only that which is about to fade and lose its scent! Alas, only birds exhausted by flight, which let themselves be caught with our hand! We immortalize things exhausted and mellow! And it is only for your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have many colors; but nobody will divine how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved- wicked thoughts!”

Have you ever found yourself running on empty, going through the motions without really feeling connected to what you’re doing?
That’s where I was before this trip. There’s a point when you realize you’re just… tired. Not just physically, but emotionally and creatively. I needed this trip not just to escape but to find myself again.
We live in a world that worships hustle, where productivity is often measured by how much we do, how busy we are, and how little we rest. I’ve always been someone who pushes through, who keeps going even when I know I’m running on nothing but coffee and maybe sugar lol. But as I wandered through the streets of Barcelona, from the towering Sagrada Familia to the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter, I realized something.
These iconic places are filled with life and energy, but instead of feeling energized, I realized I was missing the point. I was so focused on seeing everything and doing everything that I wasn’t truly experiencing any of it. Even on the subway, surrounded by people, I felt disconnected, like I was just going through the motions. It hit me that maybe, just maybe, it was okay to slow down and not do it all.
Rest isn’t just about lying down or sitting still. It’s about giving yourself permission to move at your own pace, to let go of the need to be constantly productive. As I walked through the narrow streets of Alfama, I felt something shift. The colorful buildings, the quiet moments — they invited me to slow down and just be.
Sitting at Castelo de Sao Jorge, looking out over the city, I didn’t feel the usual urge to capture the perfect photo or check off the next item on the list. Instead, I let myself just enjoy the view, the company, the moment. When we wandered into a little perfume store, it wasn’t about buying something; it was about the simple pleasure of experiencing something new, something beautiful, without any pressure. These small moments reminded me that it’s okay to simply exist, to find joy in the present.
Something I hadn’t expected was how much inspiration I would find just by slowing down and paying attention. In the midst of the busy streets, the street art, the intricate tiles, the history embedded in the architecture — even these chairs all over Barcelona — it all started to speak to me in a way I hadn’t felt in a long time.
Everywhere I looked, there was something that sparked my imagination — a piece of street art that made me pause, a beautifully tiled floor that told a story, even the way the buildings stood, each with its own history and character. It reminded me that creativity isn’t always about creating; sometimes, it’s about observing, about letting the world around you fill you with new ideas and perspectives. I realized that inspiration is everywhere if you just take the time to see it.
But beyond the beauty of the cities and the inspiration I found in the streets, what really stayed with me were the moments of connection. Sharing a meal, laughing with friends, those little moments of joy — they’re what made this trip truly meaningful. Like when we finally got our hands on those infamous Pastel da Nata from Pasteis de Belem — AMAZING.
Whether it was enjoying crepes, chatting at the plaza while eating gelato at midnight, or just sitting down for brunch at 4 p.m. because we felt like it — these moments weren’t about doing something impressive. They were about being present with the people I care about, about savoring life in its simplest, most joyful forms. And honestly, that’s where I found the most rest — in those small, meaningful moments that reminded me of what’s really important.
As I walked down the well in Quinta da Regaleira, it felt like a metaphor for what this trip had been — descending into the unknown, into a place of quiet and reflection. And just like that well, this journey brought me back up, feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to move forward. I realized that rest is its own form of productivity. It’s in those moments of stillness and quiet that we find the clarity we need to truly grow.”
I came on this trip looking for a break, a way to recharge. What I found was that rest isn’t just about doing nothing — it’s about finding the space to reconnect with yourself and to rediscover what brings you joy and peace.
So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this trip, it’s that it’s okay to take a step back. To slow down, to rest, and to reconnect with what really matters. When you give yourself permission to rest, you’re not just recharging — you’re laying the foundation for everything that comes next.

With ample sun, sights, and awesome food, there’s a ton to see and do in Lisbon, Portugal. The real magic of Lisbon comes from exploring its side streets and alleys, but there’s so much to experience all around that a good plan is needed. It’s also a spread out and hilly city, so making the most of it involves some walking and creative use of the public transportation. With a short amount of time or compressed schedule in this glimmering historic city, make sure to make the most of it to see and do the best this city has to offer.

You know when someone has a YouTube video that they want you to watch sooo badly and they SWEAR it is hysterical and that you are going to absolutely LOVE it?
And somehow the more they tell you how much you’re going to love to it, the more it kinda makes you want to not like it out of stubborn principle?
By the time you finally say “fk it” and watch the damn video to get them off your back, you’re forced into one of those super awkward fake laughs just so you don’t hurt their feelings and look like a huge asshole.
Yeah, that’s kinda how I felt about Portugal going into month 3.
I’ll preface this by saying that following Prague would be unfair for any city on our itinerary in my opinion. I had just gotten into a groove by the end of last month and was feeling all of those homey vibes I talked about in my recap post.
It sounds dumb, I know, but I have been feeling the pressure to love Lisbon this first week. I think it’s a combination of how bummed I was to leave Prague, how every site seems to have Portugal in its “Top Destinations for 2017”, and how much people who have been here before told me how much I’m going to like it. Whatever the reasoning, it just didn’t wow me right off the bat.
I’m that annoying kind of person who likes things less when people tell you how you’re going to react to them. It applies to most things — YouTube vids, songs, TV shows, and apparently cities.
I’m fully aware that it’s so stupid and that Lisbon really is incredible…it just took me a couple days to forgive it for being #notprague.
All of that being said, after spending more time in Lisbon and a weekend in Porto, it’s easy to see why Portugal belongs on all of those lists.
Lisbon is the most colorful city that I’ve ever been in. From the purple jacaranda trees to the colorful buildings decorated with brightly colored paint/tile/street art to the rainbow-like sunsets, there’s a ton of things to stare at. I mean, there are even peacocks everywhere.
The vibes from the people in Lisbon have been really incredible. People are friendly, speak good English, and are extremely social.
One of my favorite things so far has been seeing the big groups of people organically congregate around sunset at this spot called Santa Catarina which has an incredible view of the city. Every night people go there to have some drinks, play random instruments, and even sing. It’s a lot of fun to be around.
One of the best parts about moving from place to place every month is the opportunity that each new month gives you to hit the reset button. A lot of people, including myself, were feeling a little doughy leaving Prague because of all the bread, potatoes, and beer that we consumed. Before leaving Prague, our Program Leader, Mama Jen, proposed that mayyyybee this month we put some focus on getting kai-razy fit. Everyone nodded in agreement (and shame) as they took another sip from their Pilsner.
Lisbon has been the perfect place to hit the reset button with the awesome gym that we are all going to, the hills (oh, sweet Jesus, the hills…), the surfing lessons, and the lighter food and beverages.
I’m excited for this month because as a group we are focusing more and more on setting our goals for the year and supporting each other in achieving them. Looking back during the Pre-RY days, I wish I spent more time planning on how to get what I want out of this year and less time on what size of GoToobs I should get (“…but the 2oz ones have the little suction cup thingys and the 3oz don’t!” ← a real internal struggle for me *face palm*).
Also, next month Valentina and I will be going to a weekend retreat that brings together Remotes from different programs for sessions about creating change and developing new habits. Really excited about this.
Fortuitous timing gave us the opportunity to use Remote Year’s newest work space, which just opened last month. It’s got a similar feel to the WiP workspace we had in Split, but it’s different enough to make it feel like its own unique place.
Most importantly, it’s got a quiet room that is reminiscent of the quiet room (called “the library”) that I basically lived in at in the office back in Austin.

One of the things that everyone tells you when you talk about having babies is “no more travelling!”. I’ve always challenged this assumption and thought (and said) “Why? It must be slightly more challenging, but some people do it”. “Oh, you have no idea”.
I would then kind of give up and wouldn’t challenge it too much as I didn’t have babies, so if this was true, I would only understand it once I had them.
And then I had a baby. As we are Portuguese we had to plan our first holidays to visit the family in Portugal, and that meant travelling.
So we planned our first trip to Portugal. By car. From London to Lisbon. With a 3 months old.
Our friends with babies said “You’re crazy! You have no idea what you’re getting into!”. And once again we thought “What’s the big deal?”. But we had never travelled with Dinis so if it was that hard, we would only understand it once we travelled. And so we did.
Our first and most difficult trip was on August 2018 when Dinis was 3 months old. Because we wanted to spend a month in Portugal and we have Mia (our black Labrador) we decided to drive, so she could come with us (I know #crazy).
Was it cheaper than flights and leaving Mia with a dogsitter? Not really. But it was more about having her with us for all that time to be honest. A month is a long time to leave her behind. Was it easy? Nop. Did we survive? Yes. Both on the way to Lisbon and back.
Driving to Portugal from London nonstop takes 21h26 min (according to Google Maps).
We had already done it when we went to Portugal to get married and we took two days (about 12h drive each day). But with Dinis we left London, drove down to France, through to Spain and arrived in Portugal 5 days later (one of the days was a stay-over at my brother’s in France). So a 4 day drive. Double the time we had done before. And why? Well, let me explain.
There’s a few challenges when travelling with a baby in a car.
First, you need to stop every two hours. Babies shouldn’t stay in the car seat for longer than that until they’re 6 months due to risks of suffocation. So João planned a 6 hour of drive per day, with a stop every two hours. So ideally, we would spend about 8 hours a day travelling to a new destination with minimum stops included.
But our drives took about 12 hours each day. And why? Because you should only stop every 2 hours for safety purposes, but a baby has a mind of their own. They’re hungry, they pee, they poop and most of all they get bored and cry about it. Especially when they’re not used to being in a car that often (which is our case, we don’t own a car in London).
So that’s the hardest bit, you need to stop often and irregularly. You also need to be patient and either teach your baby to self soothe to sleep before you travel, during your travel or stop every single time your baby is upset or needs to sleep.
I’m not going to lie, he did get very upset a few times during our travels and at times where we couldn’t stop straight away as we’d miss the exit for a resting area. But the truth is they are not hurting, so you just need to try and calm them down with other distractions until you’re able to make the stop.
With the following travels (by plane), one thing I’ve noticed, is that breastfeeding is great for airplanes but not that great for cars. In a moving car, it’s not safe to take the baby out of the seat and hold them in the car. Should an accident happen (as we all know, these are unpredictable) and the chances of survival drop drastically.
For breastfeeding to work we, we need to feed the babies on demand. So sometimes they might sleep for 2 hours nonstop and have to be waken up, sometimes they feed every 30 min.
That’s when formula (or expressing if you’re good at it and have the patience for it) is a great help. You just need fresh boiled water in a flask, some prepared formula doses, bottles and you’re good to go!
This depends on the babies. Some babies are extremely sensitive to dirty nappies in the first months and will complain about it straight away. Dinis was like that. I understand! It must be just slightly uncomfortable to be sitting in your own pee or poop. Most rest stops will have toilets with changing tables for you to change your baby.
But when they don’t you quickly learn to improvise. I changed Dinis on grass, on a table and a lot of times on my lap whilst sitting in the car. It’s not very easy, and it depends on the size of your baby (I struggled more on the way back to London as he had grown during that month), but it’s doable.
Naps are a bliss. When they happen. I’m sooo glad decided to try and fix Dinis’ sleep before we travelled.
I believe a baby that doesn’t know how to, needs to be taught to sleep. Is it easier said than done? Hell yeah! Can it be done? Hell yeah.
From week 3, Dinis stopped sleeping properly during the day, giving me good nights, but terrible days. I couldn’t do anything. He wouldn’t even like being in the sling for too long as it was a very hot summer in London last year. So, two weeks before travelling and after 2 months of sleep struggle, we had enough and had to do something about it.
I don’t like the Ferber method (leaving your kid to cry on his own), I find it too harsh and I honestly think it wouldn’t work on Dinis (he’s a stubborn one), so I used the Tracy Hogg method (her book is on my Approved tab under the “Mum Books tab”) and we fixed Dinis’ naps during the day whilst his sleep pattern remained unchanged. From barely any sleep during the day, only sleeping on my chest we got to 3 naps a day (one of them a 2 hours nap). And him being able to get to sleep with no “boob aid” was what helped soooo much during our trip. Not that I didn’t breastfed him to sleep a few times. But at least half the time he would go to sleep on his own whilst we were on route with minimal fuss.
Should you have no time to read anything else past this (I know how motherhood works) my top tip for travelling with a baby is the following: Just go.
As with a lot of things in life, the thought of travelling with our baby is scarier and way more difficult than actually travelling with our baby. Because once you’re on route, it’s actually fine. So just grab your baby, and go. Well, prepare a little of course. But don’t let the thought of it stop you from going.
Because we’re two Portuguese living in London, if we want to see our family we need to travel. And since Dinis was born, we made 3 trips to Portugal and went to Prague on holidays. So that “impossible to travel once you have a baby” is nonsense to me. You’re a bit more limited money wise, you need to plan a bit more, but otherwise it’s all good. You just need to be a bit more flexible about your normal routine and not worry about how that will permanently affect your baby: it will not. Babies are sponges, they absorb what’s around them and they will change quickly and more effectively than we adults do. They just go with the flow.
Was this an easy trip? Not really. But would we do this again? Yes, we would. If anything it made us feel brave and made us not fear any other trip we will do with him.
So that’s it. Do it. You and your baby will be fine. And he might not remember much of it, but he will love it and you will have the best memories of it.
Hug, Millia

The ultimate guide to discover Portugal´s hidden gems

Portugal’s capital is having a moment and Americans are taking notice. Lisbon has planted itself on the radar of wealthy U.S. property buyers, drawn in by the city’s charm, affordability, and a rental market that’s too good to pass up. This year alone, at Goldcrest Buyers Agency we had a surge of over 15% on enquiries from US citizens — and I will explain why Lisbon is such an attractive destination for real estate investors.
Particularly for American investors, Lisbon offers the best of both worlds, a charming, laidback lifestyle at a fraction of the living costs as back home, and a favorable property investment scene.
Recently ranked as the sixth most profitable European city for property rentals by Global Property Guide, it’s outshining traditionally popular spots like Paris, Berlin and London. Rental yields in Lisbon averaged 5.65% by mid-2024, a number that’s been steadily climbing thanks to a strong demand from tenants and comparatively lower property prices.
For Americans, especially those used to high costs of cities like New York or San Francisco, Lisbon feels more attainable. High demand, fewer regulatory headaches than other European cities, and a booming tourism industry mean landlords can see real profits. Compared to places like Berlin or Paris, where acquisition costs are steep and rental rules are tight, Lisbon feels more accessible.
Why are Americans moving to Portugal?
Portugal has been quietly climbing the ranks as a destination for Americans looking to relocate, and the momentum is unmistakable. Google searches about “how to move to Portugal” increased by +1100% since 5 November 2024, with more Americans considering relocation than ever before.
This isn’t just a fad. Between January and June of this year, over a million U.S. tourists visited Portugal — a 15% jump from 2023. Meanwhile, the number of Americans living in Portugal grew by 44% last year, reaching over 14,000 by mid-2024. Many are drawn by the promise of a more affordable, slower-paced life.
And for Californians in particular, Portugal feels familiar. The weather is sunny, the coastline is stunning, and the lifestyle is relaxed. But unlike California, Portugal’s cost of living doesn’t break the bank.
Lisbon’s appeal for property investors
Lisbon is more than just a great place to live; it’s a smart place to invest. Tourism is booming, and short-term rental platforms have made it easy for property owners to turn their homes into income-generating assets. That said, this growth hasn’t come without challenges. The demand for rentals has pushed up prices, inciting debate about housing affordability for locals.
Despite this, property experts predict that Lisbon will remain a favorite for investors. Its location, climate, and quality of life make it instant draws for those looking to move abroad. The key for the future will be finding a balance between attracting investors and ensuring affordable housing for everyone.

This isn’t exactly a restaurant review. There are a few reasons why it would never qualify. First, I never knew the name of the restaurant in question. It wasn’t on the outside of the place, and while it was on the menu I don’t speak Portuguese. I don’t even know if the place is still in business. It was 2015 and I was in Lisbon.
The trip was crazy, I was in Lisbon for three days, Madrid for three days, Barcelona for Three days, and Paris for three days. This was day two in Lisbon, after spending a day in Sintra exploring castles.
Lisbon was a new experience for me. I’d travelled a fair bit before, but never to somewhere with that kind of history. Canada doesn’t have a lot of historical buildings. Nothing that goes back more than a few hundred years and even that tends to be historical sites, important buildings, that sort of thing. The other places I’d travelled had, up until that point, been the US, South America, and the South Pacific. None of them have really old buildings that are still in use. Lisbon had houses in the city older than the oldest buildings in Canada and they were still in use. The Airbnb I was staying in was in a courtyard that predates confederation in Canada. The whole neighbourhood was like that.

It’s easy to make it seem like everything in Lisbon is perfect, but like anywhere else on earth, Portugal has its ups and downs. On the eve of my first full calendar year here, I wanted to share some negatives about life in Lisbon that don’t often get brought up by freshly-minted immigrants.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment for me was learning that it’s very difficult to reach the rest of Europe’s rail network from Portugal. It’s not impossible, but it involves switching trains several times and the entire journey takes almost twice as long as it would take by car. Within Portugal, most of the line is on slow-rolling commuter trains, and you only hit high-speed rail once you reach the Spanish city of Badajoz. As an American, I sort of took for granted that everywhere in Europe was well-connected by train, so I did very little research in this area only to be disappointed by Portugal’s lack of integration into the rest of the continent’s high speed rail networks.
Even getting to Spain’s capital, Madrid, is no easy feat. It used to be possible to go to sleep in Lisbon and wake up refreshed in Madrid on a sleeper train. Prior to the pandemic there was an overnight sleeper train that regularly ran between Lisbon and Madrid but it hasn’t been in operation since 2021. Thankfully, there is now talk of bringing it back. There is also talk of increasing the speed of the lines between Lisbon and Madrid by refurbishing a section of the line on the Portuguese side that’s not currently suited to high speed travel. But it’s hard to imagine a rejuvenation and refurbishment of train lines being very quick, so it’s anyone’s guess as to when we might expect it.
Once you reach a major Spanish city you can fairly easily get to Paris and from Paris on to the rest of Europe, but getting to Madrid or Barcelona as a primary objective is the difficult part. Hopefully within the next few years we will have both faster, and overnight, routes between the peninsula’s major cities.
Lisbon is famous for its white and black cobblestone pathways. In the tourist areas of the city — like Chiado-Baixo — these pathways are wide and pedestrian traffic is prioritized. Elsewhere in the city, though, sidewalks can be very narrow and impossible for two people to walk abreast. This is expected in a city as old as Lisbon where it would take moving entire city blocks to widen sidewalks.
The center of my neighborhood has plenty of wide sidewalks for walking, but in the area where I live the sidewalks are narrow. Couple this with a 7-year old and cars that are frequently driving way too fast and it’s a recipe for anxiety. Even where the sidewalks are wide, it’s not unusual to see people pull their vehicles completely up on the sidewalk. While I can normally walk around them, it is almost certainly a huge challenge for the elderly and disabled.
I’ve even seen people park perpendicular to a street corner, with the ass-end of their car out in an intersection while they run into a store. This seems pretty common with the over 60 crowd, but it’s usually disregarded and nobody says anything. This seems to just be normal life in Lisbon.
And if you do own a car here, you can expect to pay out the ass for parking. People in large American cities will be familiar with this, but those of us from the burbs are accustomed to free parking everywhere. Street parking does exist, but it seems to require a lot of effort to find a spot. Personally, I’m a fan of Lisbon’s attempts to reclaim streets for pedestrians and reduce the amount of cars on its congested streets.
And here’s one final thing you should know — the highways throughout Portugal are full of toll roads and automated speed traps. We rented a car for a recent trip to Fundão and I racked up about €60 in speeding fines while going about 8km over the posted speed limit. I knew we should have taken the train!
When I was told that winters in Lisbon were wet and cold I sort of glossed over that detail. How cold could it really be?
The answer is that it gets pretty fucking cold and wet in Lisbon. The rain begins in October and doesn’t stop until late November. After a brief pause for the holidays, it begins again in the spring. Of course, climate change is creating some variations in this pattern based on what I hear from folks who have spent their entire lives here, but this winter has certainly met expectations. This is not the kind of cold like, say, Toronto or Cleveland or even Atlanta. Temperatures this winter haven't dipped below 37F so far, and most days are much more mild coming in somewhere between 45F-55F. But the combination of cold and wet creates this ongoing chilliness in the house that we use central heating systems to eliminate in the United States.
I’ve only lived in a single apartment since we moved here, so my experience with housing is pretty limited. I think we managed to lease a pretty nice apartment with modern amenities. But it seems that most buildings’ walls are concrete, which doesn’t provide very good insulation. And of course central heating is unheard of outside of newly-constructed homes in suburban developments. If you get good sun, as our apartment does, things warm up during the day in exterior rooms, but nights and mornings can be downright chilly.
You also need to open windows periodically to air the house out, otherwise it becomes stuffy and stale. In winter this is challenging because of the cold and rain. Cross-breezes are great in the summer but bone-chilling in winter and the dampness permeates your house, keeping clothes from drying and creating excellent conditions for mold. So you wind up with this twofold problem in the fall and winter: you need to open the windows, but it lets the cold and dampness in.
Last year due to the problem with drying clothes, we bought a dryer. This year, due to the presence of mold in our bathroom, we bought a dehumidifier. Take people at their word when they say Lisbon gets cold.
Speaking of airing out the house, the air quality outside is not always great and is worsened by passing cars. Occasionally, it’s even worse off when there is a wildfire near Lisbon, which happens a lot now during the dry summers.
We’re among other US families and friends that have noticed an uptick in respiratory infections and I was told by a friend from the US that has lived in Lisbon a few years longer than us that respiratory illnesses are common in Lisbon, especially among kids. Lisbon is a port city, a major tourist destination, and as a very old city, suffers from lots of dust and mold which find their way into the air when disturbed.
We're on the first floor (which is what we'd refer to as the 2nd floor in the US) and with our windows open we get kind of dirty air from outside passing through the house if we don't have the cross-breeze going in the opposite direction. A good breeze can help keep the combination of dust, mold, and car exhaust moving, but if the air is still it wafts into the house. Cigarette smoke is common too, and definitely factors into the equation if you spend any amount of time at quiosques or patios.
We have a 7 year old and so we're not always sure what's normal during cold season for kids her age. Not to mention that she came of age during the peak of the pandemic where masking was common and we have now largely abandoned that practice unless we ourselves are sick and going out in public. My grandmother would have said ""she's got the crud,"" and I think that's mostly it. But during our first year in Lisbon we had ""the crud"" frequently, though so far this year it has been noticeably better.
We are also regularly among crowds of other people: on the metro, the bus, or just walking through the mercado. These situations obviously present opportunities to transmit airborne illnesses, whereas in the United States prior to the pandemic it was very rare that we were in crowded spaces with other people. This doesn't really seem like a coincidence.
There's a lot going on here, including the fact that I have had asthma since I was about my daughter's age. Unfortunately, maybe that's going to be true of her as well. If there is a positive spin I can put on this issue, it's that Ventolin inhalers can be acquired here without a prescription (I read this somewhere online, tried it for myself, and found it to be true!) and the cost of my daily asthma medication is something like €30 a month (compared to closer to $120 a month back home).
We’re still happy here, and we think the drawbacks of living in Lisbon are outweighed by the benefits to our life, which I talk about in other articles. There are other minor challenges and things we don’t like, which would be true of anywhere we lived. Things like:
These things don’t amount to a hill of beans, however, when we think about how happy we are to be here and about all the other things we love about being in Lisbon. And if we’d known about these things before moving here, we still would have come. A big part of our relocation to Portugal was to consciously become more adaptable and make changes in our lives in order to thrive in a new community. And while we knew things like climate control would be challenging, we have already started to acclimate to the changes. We have dealt with both heat and cold better than we did during our first year, and we anticipate that this will only improve the longer we’re here.
I know we’ll find more things that rub us the wrong way the longer we stay here, but our first year and a half here has also taught us that we are adaptable — that we can still change and reinvent ourselves, and that there are also new and exciting things to love spread out around this small-but-beautiful country.

When I left Paris — after visiting a few cities in France, I headed to Lisbon, Portugal. After all, I was already in Europe. So, why not explore more than just France — thus killing two or three birds with one stone? (No birds were harmed during this trip).
As my Uber driver approached where my hotel was located, I saw a bridge. A long one! And as we got closer, I was taken aback by its resemblance to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
I was like, wait a minute, where am I?
The Ponte 25 de Abril (the 25th of April Bridge in English), connects the city of Lisbon to the municipality of Almada. I later learned that it was built by an American Bridge Company, and one can see where the inspiration for the design came from. The bridge’s upper section accommodates cars and the section under is for trains. However, unlike the Golden Gate Bridge, Ponte 25 de Abril doesn’t allow pedestrians or biking on the bridge.
As I gazed into the distance, I saw a statue. I later read that it was called Christ The King — a Catholic monument and shrine overlooking the city of Lisbon and was inspired by the…

If you’re reading this article, it means you’re hoping to meet new people in Lisbon, that’s awesome! You may be considering moving here permanently, exploring Lisbon as a digital nomad, or you may have lived here for a while and feel like it’s the time to get out there and make new friendships. Whatever the reason, the answer to “How do I begin?” is the same: download the Meetup App.
In case you were wondering why I’m recommending Meetup instead another app: no, I’m not affiliated with Meetup in any way. When I first came to Lisbon at the beginning of 2022, I tried out various apps, and Meetup stood out to me as the one with the most significant number of interesting-sounding events that fill up quickly.
So, in this article, I would love to mention a list of Meetups that I found particularly worthy of checking out. If you think that I missed out on any excellent Meetup event, please leave a comment below so that everyone can benefit :)
The list of great 10 Meetups includes:
Curious Monkey
This is a non-profit group and a creative space for sharing knowledge about art and bringing together local and expat communities in Lisbon. They organize various events, including yoga, open mics, and talks with book authors, journalists, and casts of well-known shows such as Cirque Du Soleil. If you’re looking for some quality conversations, then Curious Monkey will be a great group to join!
www.meetup.com
Drink & Draw
Drink & Draw hosts pop-up drawing sessions in unique locations around Lisbon. For around twenty euros, you can enjoy a mobile-phone-free session with incredible people at a beautiful local winery or a cafe. Each participant is handed a set of drawing materials upon entry and a drink choice, and then the drawing begins! Two or more models pose in the middle of the room, and participants are given tasks such as “draw the model in 30 sec” or “draw the model in 7 min but with the opposite hand.” It’s a lot of fun and an excellent opportunity to explore your drawing technique.
www.meetup.com
Future Founders
I’m a big fan of this group because I always leave their events feeling inspired and with a sense that I learned something new. The group attracts founders, product people, and venture capitalists. It’s the perfect place to obtain or give feedback, discuss technology, and get funding! Some of the events take place in a park where participants gather in small groups to discuss challenges and ideas, and then the groups are swapped every 15–20 min. For those of you who have a business registered in Portugal, this may be an excellent place to learn more about the legal side of things as the group hosts talks dedicated to this topic as well.
www.meetup.com
Lisbon Digital Nomads
Boasting 17K+ members at the time of writing, this group is growing fast and is the best way to connect with other digital nomads and make new like-minded friends. The group organizes recurring running, networking, and board game events. The event spots tend to exceed 100 participants per event, but don’t be disappointed if you end up on a waiting list. You can still show up to the event and be admitted!
www.meetup.com
Polylogue’s Lightning Talks
If there were a category for the most thought-provoking event host, Polylogue would win. The idea behind this group is simple yet powerful: whoever shows up can give a 5 min talk about any topic of their choice. The host will provide a projector, a microphone, and snacks. The reason why I love this event so much is that it forces you in a way to learn something new that you would otherwise not look into. Topics range from highly technical concepts to funny talks about delivering packages to the most secluded places in the world to relationship advice. Whatever the case may be, it’s always fun, and it’s a great way to meet people who are passionate about what they do in life. Additionally, if you’re looking for a new coworking space, attending Lightning Talks may help you decide, as the events are hosted across various coworks.
www.meetup.com
Lisbon Supper Club
I first encountered this concept in Lisbon and immediately fell in love with it. This is how it works: you sign up for a themed supper (for example, a “British Roast” or “Truffle Lovers”), pay around 25 euros, and then attend the supper with up to 20 people who also signed up. The interesting twist is that the supper takes place in the dining room inside the chef’s apartment which creates an incredible atmosphere encouraging all the strangers to get to know one another by the end of the feast. The food is delicious, the ambiance is magical, and the new friendships last!
www.meetup.com
Passport Comedy
I’m not going to lie, I had low expectations for this group before going to their first event. And then — haha! Little did I know how excellent these events would turn out to be. Passport Comedy has a solid lineup of comedians who will guarantee you an evening filled with tears of laughter. I laughed there more than at the Comedy Cellar in NYC. Grab your spot before these comedians begin doing Netflix Stand-Up Comedy Specials — it’s worth it!
www.meetup.com
Storytelling Lisboa
The concept of this group is quite fascinating. Each event has a specific theme, such as “Chaos,” “Breaks,” or “Landlords,” and one thing in common — participants can volunteer to spend 10 min telling their story to an audience of 200+ people. Anyone can volunteer to tell a story, but there can be no more than ten speakers per event. The stories range from sad to funny, and the events are hosted in English or Portuguese. I was impressed by how well-structured, emotional, and thought-provoking these stories are. It’s an event format that is worth checking out at least once.
www.meetup.com
The Block Lisboa
This article wouldn’t be complete without at least one mention of a crypto-focused group. The Block hosts many crypto, NFT, and developer events. Some of them are more technical and may require prior knowledge, so make sure to read through the event description. I attended an excellent NFT workshop that felt like a whole course on NFTs, met extremely savvy people, and enjoyed great food. Regardless of how familiar you’re with blockchain, I strongly recommend looking through what The Block offers as long as you’re curious about how things work.
www.meetup.com
Two Left Feet
And finally, salsa and bachata! This group guarantees a relaxing evening filled with music and dance moves. As long as the weather’s good, the classes take place outdoors, and the instructor explains each move clearly. While dancing, the participants are asked to switch partners with every new song, so this class is a great way to get better at salsa and bachata and an excellent way to make new friends.
www.meetup.com
That’s it! I strongly recommend checking out these Meetup groups. I realize there are other great groups out there, so if you feel like I missed any of them, please leave a comment so that every reader can benefit from your recommendation. I am seeing more and more groups being added weekly, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this list grows 10x by the end of 2023!

This historic city has delicious seafood, unique local music, and stunning views
The gates of old Lisbon can be seen through the colorful houses and streets. (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
I’ve just got back from exploring one of the warmest, most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited: Lisbon
After a week of exploring Portugal’s capital, I’ve come up with some must-dos for making the most out of your visit.
The beautiful gates of old Lisbon (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
The internal transportation system in Lisbon is easy to use: you go to any metro station and from the machines there buy a Viva Viagem card for 50 cents. You then charge the card as much as you want, in increments of 3, 5, and 10 euros.
Once you’ve charged your card, you can select what kind of ticket you want to use it for. You can “zap” in and out of the metro and some buses by touching the card over a scanner at the beginning and end of each journey. This will automatically deduct the cost of your trip from your card’s total.
Alternatively, before you begin your day’s travel you can choose to buy a day pass the ticket on the card for 6 euros, which may work out cheaper.
Pro tip: Get two cards — one for zapping, and one to use if you needed a day pass.
Lisbon is famous for its seafood and for its pastries. There is a lot to try, but if I had to recommend just two must-eats, they would be Bacalhau (salted cod) and Pastel de nata (custard tartlets).
Pastel de nata (amazing Portuguese pastry made from custard), is something you can’t miss when visiting Lisbon
Pastel de nata is one of the most common and well-known Portuguese pastries, and every visitor to Lisbon should try them. Pasteis de Belem makes a great version, by far the best I tried. They were so delicious I managed 12 in one day!
The Bacalhau meanwhile is a very popular ingredient in Portuguese cooking. It’s delicious and quite different from anything you will have tried elsewhere. And don’t skimp on the other kinds of seafood, which is such a key part of Portuguese cuisine — try the grilled salmon, for example.
Pro tip: Go to Casa Portuguesa do Pastel de Bacalhau in the famous Rua Augusta and try a special twist on Bacalhau. This place mixes the traditional flavors in a cod cake filled with Serra da Estrela cheese — a match made in heaven!
Lisbon has its own genre of music, Fado, which is like blues with a touch of folk, and more sadness. If you look online you will find a lot of “Fado houses” recommended by various travel guides to Lisbon, but these are all quite pricey, touristy places.
If you want an authentic experience, just go to Alfama district around 9 to 10 pm, wander through the streets, and check out the small local bars. You will often find places that host non-famous but beautiful Fado singers. Get a drink or a light dinner and enjoy an authentic Portuguese night — one of the best experiences I had in Lisbon.
If you open any Lisbon travel guide, you’ll always find this tip: ride tram №28. The reason is that this tram’s route passes through very interesting, scenic districts of Lisbon, including Baixa, Graça, Alfama, and Estrela.
And the tram itself is old and historical and looks beautiful to ride. But this has become a very touristic attraction and it’s literally full of pickpockets.
Tram 12 because the famous Tram 28 is a tourist trap. (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
So be smart and instead ride tram №12, just beside it. It goes to most of the same places and will provide you with a better experience.
Pro tip: Don’t take the full trip; ride the tram until you arrive at Se Cathedral and hop off. You are now on the top of the hill in the Alfama district. The cathedral is worth seeing and a couple of steps beside it is Santa Luiza Miradouro, a perfect place to watch the sunset, after which you can head to the city center on foot — a beautiful and easy walk.
The view from Santa Luiza Miradouro, one of many beautiful viewpoints on top of the hills in Lisbon (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Lisbon is spread over seven hills. The tops of these hills provide a wonderful opportunity to view the city. These panoramic viewpoints are called miradoras in Portuguese and there are many of them. It’s a free way to view the city’s beauty. Watch a sunset or a sunrise from a miradouro and I promise you it will be something you will never forget.
Above I mentioned the Santa Luiza Miradouro (a personal favorite). But you can also try the Praça Alegria Miradouro (reached from Praça dos Restauradores by the traditional Funicular Gloria), which provides views over Baixa, leading towards the Rio Tejo.
Castelo de Sao Jorge Miradouro is also nice, although don’t bother with the Castle Sao Jorge next door — it’s a waste of time. But this miradouro is on top of the highest hill in Lisbon, so the view is beautiful.
Shopping is a real pleasure here at Centro Colombo, the most famous shopping mall in Lisbon (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Lisbon is a very good clothes shopping destination in Europe, with seriously good prices!
The best place for a shopping spree is Columbus mall; I got a beautiful coat and a pair of jeans for 33 euros this December (650 EGP!).
Pro tip: One word: PRIMARK
There are a lot of amazing day trips that you can do from Lisbon, taking a train from Rossio train station (which is a beautiful thing to see even if you are not traveling!). But if you will do just one, then without a doubt it should be the beautiful city of Sintra.
The beautiful Sintra, a close-by city and a recommended day trip from Lisbon (Photo by: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Sintra is a historic city over the hills, full of old beautiful palaces and a grand Moorish castle that is worth seeing. The city’s central streets are made of cobblestones and the whole architectural style is colorful and beautiful.
Pro tip: when you arrive by train, exit on the right and wait for the tourist public bus 434 (5 euros); it will take you on a one-way circular ride around the three most important landmarks of Sintra (the town, the Moorish castle on the hill, and the Pena Palace). You can ride and hop on/off any bus until you make a full circle back to the train station. The castle is highly recommended!

This story is about how a one encounter can change everything and how Lisbon can tell you everything if you can listen
Recently we were walking around the city with my friend and he asked me,
— Does the city respond to you? It got me thinking.
If you think of a city as a separate civilization, any city responds to me. Perhaps because I am a historian and I love life, comfortable shoes, walking at least 10 thousand steps a day and have endless curiosity. For me, a city is about life. Some look at a city as a geographical object, others as an investment, a source of income, beauty, history or just a backdrop. I look at the city as a separate civilization. On the other hand, there is a city and there is a village. In the village, life is organized differently. In the village, in my opinion, not much happens. All life is concentrated in the city — championships, concerts, forums, summits, museums, galleries, meetings, marches, etc. Open any news and all the news is about city life. The city is about life. And who is interested in other people’s life? A person is either not interested in it, or he looks at it from the outside, half-heartedly. He’s busy with his own life. For example, can you describe the street where you go to work every day and tell another person about it in such a way that he wants to live on this street? Can you convey your interest in life to another person? Apparently, when we say that this city responds or doesn’t respond to me, we don’t mean the facades of the houses. We’re talking about how the life of the city coincides with our own idea of life. Or it doesn’t. And then it seems like a foreign city.
Cities like people.
First encounter with Lisbon
It wasn’t love at first sight. But it was love. For Lisbon or for Bruno or for Lisbon through love for Bruno. It doesn’t matter anymore. It’s love. I think of Bruno so often that I sometimes think I made him up. Maybe I did. No there really is a guy named Bruno, who showed up at a moment when I felt like there was no way we matched up with Lisbon. He showed up and opened my eyes to this city. No, he wasn’t my city guide, but he looked and kissed me in a way that made me want to live in this city. No, Bruno and I aren’t a couple, he’s still in my memories, and what’s more, I don’t think he even realizes the Important role he played in my life. But my story with Lisbon will always begin with that encounter.
Lisbon responded to me
The day after meeting Bruno, I went for a walk with a completely different mood and found myself in Rossio Square. I took a 360 degree look around and realized that from this point I could see all of Portugal’s history.
Did you know that you can see the history of the country by standing in this very square and you don’t even have to move anywhere? Don’t believe me? Now you will 😊
Medieval Ages
Look up the hill to the east to see St. George’s Castle, one of the oldest buildings in Lisbon. This is where Portugal’s history as a kingdom begins. Having survived the Romans and Visigoths, the Iberian Peninsula was subjected to a new invasion. In 711 Muslims came to its territory — they were called Moors. The beginning of Portugal’s own independent history is associated with the name of Afonso I Henriques, nicknamed the Conqueror. Personality has significance in history. Thanks to Afonso I the territory of the country increased many times. But the most valuable trophy of Afonso I was undoubtedly Lisbon, which after cruel battles in 1147 became part of Portugal and turned into one of the largest centers of the country, and in 1255 the capital from Coimbra was moved to Lisbon.
Not far from Rossio Square there is Martin Muniz Square, who fought bravely during the siege of Lisbon, he alone attacked the gates of the fortress and defended them without letting them close, sacrificing his life. Thanks to Martin Muniz’s feat, the attacking Christian soldiers were able to approach the open gate and capture the fortress.
It is on this square that the famous 28th tram stops, which will take you to St. George’s Castle. Of course, you can also climb the hill on foot and get confused in the maze of streets of Alfama. It is from here that the city began to grow, descending down the hill to the banks of the Tagus River.
If you turn to the west, you will see the Gothic arches of the ruins of the Karmu Monastery. It was once one of the largest churches in the city. The history of the monastery began in 1385, when before the decisive battle of Aljubarrota, King João I of Avis and his magnificent commander-in-chief of the Portuguese army, 25-year-old Nuno Alvares Pereira, made a vow: in the event of victory over the Castilians, each would build a monastery in honor of Our Lady. To commemorate the victory and in fulfillment of the vow made before the battle, João I founded the monastery of Batalha, and Nuno Alvares Pereira in 1389 founded a monastery of the Carmelite order in Lisbon, known as the “Church of Carmo”. Where he later donated all his considerable fortune, and then took monastic tonsure. Pious Nuno lived in the monastery until the end of his days. The hero of the battle Nuno Alvares Pereira deservedly got his place on the arch in the main square Praça do Comércio.
The Carmelite Monastery was to become one of the most beautiful monuments of the National Gothic, but a tragic fate awaited it. On November 1, 1755, the vaults of the church could not withstand the strong earth tremors and collapsed, burying the townspeople who came to mass under them and losing forever the tomb of Connetabile Nuno, whom the Vatican canonized recently in 2009. The Battle of Aljubarrota, in which Portuguese troops defeated the Castilian army, laid the foundations for the Age of Discovery.
The Age of the Great Discovery was a golden age for Portugal, the XV-XVI centuries
Take a look at the square beneath your feet: the wave-shaped mosaic is no accident. It is a symbol of the ocean, of the sea voyages that made Portugal a great empire. Portugal opened the world to the world and discovered itself. The age of the Great Discovery was a golden age for Portugal, the XV-XVI centuries were a time of unprecedented Portuguese greatness, it was a wonderful time of selfless and courageous navigators heroes.
Breathe in the air. Can you smell it?
The most incredible smell I’ve ever smelled is the smell of jacaranda. Lisbon’s lilac tree, Jacaranda mimosifolia, is truly worthy of the royal court. Jacaranda came from Brazil, bringing with it the scent of honey, grapes and the Atlantic Ocean. Brazil was a colony of Portugal, and Rio de Janeiro even served as the capital of the empire for 13 years, because of the invasion of Napoleon’s army under the command of General Junot the royal house had to move to Brazil in 1807. It is a unique fact in history that the capital of an empire becomes its overseas colony.
In fact, the official name of the square is Pedro IV Square. In the center of the square you can see a monument to the King of Portugal and the first emperor of Brazil.
Rossio Square now looks smart and peaceful. And once the fires of the Inquisition were burning here, heretics and witches were burned on the place of today’s national theater of Queen Mary stood the palace of the Inquisition and people always gathered to watch this spectacle. The first autodafa took place here in 1540.
Slowly, the former greatness of the Portuguese Empire fades away and in 1580. Portgugal fell under Spanish rule for 60 years. In 1640 there is a rebellion in Lisbon, as a result of which the independence of Portugal was restored. And if we walk a little from Rossio Square past the magnificent train station, we will see the Monumento dos Restauradores.
In 1755 Lisbon was destroyed by a terrible earthquake.
Take a look around — this is Lisbon Pombal. Lisbon rebuilt after the earthquake. a great city reborn after a great catastrophe. At least, that was the original intention of Marquis Sebastião José Pombalho, who was appointed by King José I to lead the rebuilding of Lisbon after the devastating earthquake of 1755 and who created the so-called Pombaline style. One of the most characteristic features of the Pombalino style is its desire for order and will to live, which can be traced back to people’s desire to protect themselves from the destructive elements. If in Alfama it is very easy to get lost in its chaotic winding streets, then in the lower new Lisbon it is impossible to do so — the city is built on a plan, clearly on a line. The task before the architects was difficult — it was necessary not only to rebuild a part of the country, but also to make the buildings stronger and more resistant to seismic activity. Pombalino style is very visible on the streets of the city — strict rectangular shapes of buildings, the exterior of buildings is simple, standard and laconic.
Breathe in again. What do you smell this time?
It’s the smell of coffee and the roaring 1920s. I was sitting in Café Nicola, where the bohemians of Lisbon drank coffee. Did you know that Portugal is a coffee fanatic country. According to the Potrugal Coffee Association (Associação Industrial e Comercial do Café https://aicc.pt/) 80% of Portuguese people can’t imagine their lives without coffee, while the rest don’t drink it. Remember the phrase: “Um café e um pastel de nata, por favor” and you won’t be lost. A vida só começa depois de um café — life begins only after coffee. I don’t know who this phrase belongs to, but I’m sure he was Portuguese. By the way, definitely those 20% are lying.
The 20th century is a turbulent time.
As I stood in Rossio Square I remembered that it was here in 1974 that thousands of people gathered to celebrate the fall of the dictatorship. On April 25, 1974, a bloodless military revolution took place in Portugal. Soldiers, tired of colonial wars and censorship, overthrew the authoritarian regime. In the streets, women and children came up to them, put carnations in the barrels of their rifles — and they did not shoot. Red carnations became a symbol of freedom and in Portugal you look at them in a special way. This event has become a symbol of hope for all of Europe.
Here in Lisbon, in Rossio Square, on Avenida da Liberdade, at the walls of Carmo, the dreams of freedom have become a reality. And I want to remember that revolutions are not always accompanied by weapons. Sometimes it’s just flowers and music. And that’s the lesson of Lisbon.
And that’s not all that Rossio Square has to tell us.
The city responded to me. It was in this city that I first experienced how deeply a place can speak if you know how to listen to it. Here, in Rossio Square, another Portugal opened up before me.
If you have walked around Rossio Square too, tell what you felt. Maybe this place opened up an unexpected side of Portugal for you?
I want to work in Lisbon as a tour guide. I want to tell the guests of the city about the history of the country, which has given the world so many wonderful discoveries and not only geographical discoveries and many lessons.
That’s my dream.And dreams are supposed to come true.

Posted: 6/26/2003 | June 23rd, 2023
Lisbon is one of my favorite cities in the world. It’s home to impressive museums, historic buildings, picturesque plazas, chilled-out cafes, and a lively mix of clubs and candlelit music venues where people go to listen to traditional fado music. I fell in love with the city as soon as I arrived — and it was even better the second time!
Today, Lisbon is one of the most popular cities on the continent. From cruisers to digital nomads, everyone loves this sunny city. I’ve visited a few times over the years and always look forward to going back. The warm weather, inviting colors, and laid-back vibe really make people feel welcome.
The best way to see the city, though (especially if it’s your first time) is to take a walking tour. It’s the first thing I do when I visit a new city as it’s the best way to connect with a local guide, get insider info, and see the main sights.
These days, there are a ton of walking tours available to ensure you make the most of your visit. Here’s a list of my favorites — from free tours to food tours to pub crawls — to help you sort through it all so you just end up with the best!
Best Overall Tour
Learn More
I’ve taken Walks tours all over Europe and it is, by far, my favorite tour company. They always manage to go above and beyond with tours that are both fun and educational.
In Lisbon, they offer a few tours (including food tours) but for a good primer on the city I recommend their Lisbon in a Day tour. It includes a river cruise, early access to Jeronimos Monastery, and lunch. It lasts a full day too!
Best Free Tour
Learn More
This informative three-hour free tour takes you through five of Lisbon’s most popular neighborhoods — Graça, Alfama, Baixa, Chiado, and Bairro Alto — offering up an entertaining and enlightening dose of history and culture along the way.
The tours also focus on a more local side of Lisbon. If you’re on a budget and want an introduction to the city, this is the tour for you. Just remember to tip the guide!
Here are a few more walking tour options to help you make the most of your time in Lisbon:
Devour started in Spain and quickly began doing tours in Lisbon. They offer a food and fado tour, mixing two cultural highlights of Lisbon on one tour. I personally like the Tastes & Traditions food tour they do: you stop at seven small businesses in Lisbon, eating up to nine samples and sipping three different types of beverages. Devour is one of the best food tour companies in Europe and their Lisbon tours are no exception.
Tours start at 95 EUR.
Book here!
This tour company offers a whole range of tours but their Best of Lisbon introductory tour is perfect for both first-time Lisbon visitors and budget travelers. The three-hour tour starts at 9:30am and takes you through some of the city’s main neighborhoods, making a stop for wine and a bite of the famous pastry, pastel de nata (an egg custard tart). The group tours max out at 14 people.
Tours start at 18 EUR.
Book here!
Street art has taken over the world’s big cities, including Lisbon. On this three-hour tour, you’ll see some of the best works in the city and learn about the social and political motives behind them. Tours are led by a local street artist too, so you’ll really get an insider’s look at the scene and visit murals most other tours skip.
Tours start at 35 EUR.
Book here!
Pancho does tours all over the Iberian Peninsula, using local guides and crafting itineraries that focus on street art, tapas and wine, and day trips to places like Sintra. Personally, I like their fado music tour. During the 2.5-hour tour, you’ll learn everything there is about this melancholic music that’s endemic to Portugal. You’ll get a front-row seat at a fado show in the center of Lisbon at the end.
Tours start at around 40 EUR.
Book here!
Overtourism is a problem in many cities, particularly in Europe, with crowds of people ping-ponging from one attraction to the next. Hence, the idea behind We Hate Tourism Tours: the 3.5-hour walking tour takes you to some way off-the-radar neighborhoods to show you how the people of Lisbon really live. There are only about six people per tour, which keeps things intimate. It also means you should book in advance as tours sell out fast. I love how they are getting people out of the main touristy areas and showing you a real look at Lisbon life. I can’t recommend this tour enough.
Tours start at 40 EUR.
Book here!
Lisbon has a very lively nightlife these days and, if you’re looking for a way to see it while also meeting other travelers, the classic pub crawl is a good way to go. This tour takes you to three spots, with a free shot at the first and the third stop. Plus, there’s a one-hour period of all-you-can-drink cider or sangria. It’s a great option for solo travelers looking to meet other people. It’s not a real “local” thing but it’s fun!
Tours start at 20 EUR.
Book here!
***
Lisbon has walking tours for just about every interest and budget, which is one of the many reasons I love the city. Whenever I visit, I always take a tour or two because the city just has so much to see and do, and the local guides always add a ton of value to my trip. These tours allow you to get an inside perspective on life here and ask locals questions on where to go, what to do, and how to act. Be sure to take at least one of these tours while you are in the city.
My detailed, 200+ page guidebook is made for budget travelers like you! It gets straight to the practical information you need to save money while backpacking around Europe. You’ll find suggested itineraries, budgets, ways to save money, on and off the beaten path things to see and do, non-touristy restaurants, markets, and bars, and more! Click here to learn more and get started!
Book Your Flight Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. They are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. Two of my favorite places to stay are:
If you’re looking for more places to stay, here is a complete list of my favorite hostels in Lisbon.
Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:

Stories from Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking lands and cultures

Recently I received a call from an Asian friend, who also happens to be a former colleague. He was embarking on a maiden trip to Lisbon, and wanted me to help him formulate a list of things to do.
I’ve been to Portugal’s capital city so many times that I have got bored with it. In fact, these days when I plan a trip to the Iberian nation, I prefer to skip the capital altogether.
Having said that, even though a typically touristy exercise, it was nonetheless my friend’s first trip to Lisbon. As such, I wanted to help him in every way I could, hoping to contribute as much information as was possible. In any case, his list of questions was palpably a long one.
Frankly speaking, Portugal’s capital has quite a few iconic monuments and tourist attractions. On the contrary, a lot of options mean someone who is visiting the city for the first time would struggle to make decisions.
It was a matter of time before his itinerary became increasingly elaborate. Based on suggestions, including that of yours truly, he had included Arco da Rua Augusta (Rua Augusta Arch), Avenida da Liberdade (Avenue of Liberty), Baixa Pombalina (Downtown), Mosteiro dos Jerónimos (the Jerónimos Monastery or…

Lisbon,https://medium.com/explore-everyday/tagged/lisbon,"So much to say about these past days in Lisbon, Portugal. I can’t really claim to have discovered this city properly or put enough effort into understanding the Portuguese culture and for this I am placing the blame squarely on the city’s ability to party.
Dear You:
Home is such a faraway place now — across the ocean and 13 hours back, with your body strapped in place and the monitor throwing light onto your lap. You cannot sleep. Blue butterflies trail down Cinderella’s ball gown, and Taylor Swift…
We spent two nights in Lisbon as part of our 5 night trip to Portugal for the March Easter weekend. Getting from Sintra to Lisbon was pretty easy although we did have some confusion when getting a ticket from the machine — it’s probably better to head into the main train station and buy a ticket from there.
When people talk about Chapitô, the first image that usually comes to their mind is the stunning view of Lisbon they get from the terrasse of the restaurant, Chapitô à Mesa. But the project of Chapitô goes beyond the simple borders of its restaurant: Chapitô reunites…
Workdays can be pretty exhausting at times and Friday can seem far away. Fortunately, someone came…

I love the bustle of Lisbon: the up-and-down streets, the beauty of the multicolored azulejos façades on the buildings, the decorated cobblestone streets and sidewalks, and even the grittiness of the poorer neighbourhoods. But sometimes you want a break, a place without busy-ness, without touristy-ness. A place where you can feel calm and reflective for few hours. I discovered such a place in Estrela Park, a few blocks from the gleaming and grand Portuguese Parliament Buildings, and just opposite the Basilica da Estrela.
In contrast to these grand and gleaming buildings, Estrela Park feels intimate and a bit wild. Its main features are the exotic plants and trees from around the world that grow tall and lush within its gates. The park was designed in 1842 as a place for the working classes of Lisbon to relax and forget the toil and the stress of city living. Ironically, funding for construction dried up due to political instability, and the park was not completed until thirty years later. This was a tumultuous time for Portugal, as the nation veered precariously and at times violently between monarchists and republicans.
The tranquil green spaces are punctuated by several beautiful stone statues. It occurred to me that this juxtaposition between art and nature, white and green, would be worth a photo essay, showing the statues at a distance, half-hidden by the foliage, and then up close, where the depth of their expressiveness is unconcealed. But then, as I learned the stories behind these statues they revealed themselves to be much more than decorative. I’m presenting them in the order I came across them as I explored the park (and with gratitude to this Wordpress article, which helped me fill in the blanks about their origins):
The King’s Daughter, Guardian of the Ducks
She stands amid the rushes in the center of a pond, carrying a bundle of straw or something; a gaggle of stone ducks flocks around her feet. Up close, the naturalistic Art Nouveau style of the sculpture shows her in motion, walking along, yet looking down with care and affection at the ducks she guards. But wait: why would anyone guard ducks?
I discovered online that the statue was inspired by the Norwegian fairy tale of the same name, which I had never before heard of. The ducks, it turns out, are actually the 12 brothers of the princess. They had been enchanted by an evil witch. The princess risked her own life to break the spell, which could only be done by weaving each brother a shirt from thistledown (that’s what she carries in her arms). The down had to be harvested by moonlight in the moor of the trolls. It’s a harrowing tale of courage and deception, well worth reading.
Statue of João de Deus
João de Deus was a famous Portuguese poet, educator and politician of the 19th century, known for his personal rigor and political independence — he never joined a political party. I first spied him behind the wrought-iron fence of the bandstand, beneath a flowering jacaranda tree. I was struck by the upright posture of this diminutive man, whose large head makes his body seem quite short. He seems both humble and strangely dignified. The school just next to the park bears his name.
Wikipedia says this about him: Next to Camões and perhaps Almeida Garrett, no Portuguese poet has been more widely read, more profoundly admired than João de Deus; yet no poet in any country has been more indifferent to public opinion and more deliberately careless of personal fame…
Oh my! He sounds like a man with the heart of a flanêur!
The Digger
This statue of a farmer tilling the soil with a hoe was erected in 1913 — the first statue added to the garden after the monarchy was abolished and Portugal became a republic in 1910. Framed behind a spreading banyan tree, the sculpture seems a fitting public expression to mark the political transition. Notice how clearly the man’s rough clothing and strong arms are depicted.
But that look in his eyes — it’s not that of a victorious peasant embracing his nation’s freedom, is it? To me, he is looking up anxiously, almost fearfully. Perhaps he symbolizes the entire nation, still working hard just to survive, gazing towards an uncertain future of the 20th Century. Would the eyes of a similar statue created in Portugal in 2022 look much different?
The Awakening, or Laziness
This 1915 statue of a naked young woman arising in the morning is said to be the most popular in the park. It’s easy to see why. From a distance, under an umbrella tree, her white figure is eye-catchingly sensuous.
Up close, though, it is the expression on her face that makes her so utterly beguiling — that satisfied, languorous smile, those half-opened eyes! Though one of her arms is missing, the other is clearly in the middle of a stretch. I love the two very different words the woman supposedly embodies: Awakening and Laziness. Is she rising to meet the day, awakening to the possibilities and hopes of her future — much as the young republic was awakening? Or has she already risen too late to do anything productive with her youthful energy? It’s hard not to think about her fellow statue, the Digger, not 50 meters away, who has been toiling away, probably since dawn.
Statue of Antero de Quental
Antero de Quental was a 19th Century realist poet and political philosopher, but his statue is the last edition to the park. It was installed in this private grove of ivy-covered trees in 1951. It makes me laugh to see a “realist” poet dressed in the robes of an ancient Roman! I hope he has a good sense of humor in whatever immortal realm of the poets he resides.
As a young poet, de Quental declared the role of poets, in an era of great transformation, was to be messengers of the day’s great ideological questions. He emerged as a socialist, advocate of the proletariat, and eventually an anarchist. To me it’s surprising his defiant-seeming statue was installed in the midst of Portugal’s repressive Salazar dictatorship.
Wikipedia has this to say about the great poet, and the sad ending of his life: Throughout his life, de Quental oscillated between pessimism and depression; afflicted with what might have been bipolar disorder…he committed suicide by two gunshots to the stomach while seated on a bench in a local garden park. He died approximately an hour later. “Of all things, the worst is having been born,” he wrote in a poem.
Allegory (Man with a Dog)
This final statue I encountered reclines at the edge of another little lake in the park, and has an “unknown provenance.” Seen below, shrouded behind palm trees, it features a man in a robe with wild curly hair and a long beard that appears blown back as he leans slightly into an invisible strong wind. His large, powerful hands hold protectively onto his little dog. Its lips form a wide “O” because its mouth is also the spout of a fountain.
There is something loveable about this sculpture. I suppose it is the forcefulness of the man juxtaposed with the gentle way he holds his companion. It made me smile and think of all the old men and women I’ve seen in Lisbon, even in Estrela Park, out walking their little dogs.
The future might be wild and uncertain, but we can do the best we can to take care of the ones we love, whether dogs or ducks or a whole nation, even a continent, once again in the midst of turbulent times and perhaps a great transformation.

When you think of finding your way around in places that are unknown, you rely on GPS and your phone to help you get there. Back in 2016, when I was exploring Lisboa (Lisbon), Portugal, I found myself in the Alfama district. It’s one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city and possibly one of the most confusing places you could be in.
As I walked through the neighborhood, I found myself lost in a seemingly endless maze of narrow, winding staircases and hidden alleys. Without the help of GPS or the internet, I had to rely on my sense of direction to find my way around. Turns out, that sense was non-existent.
Despite feeling completely disoriented, exploring Alfama was an adventure in itself. Around every turn, I found unexpected surprises: charming courtyards, hidden plazas, and laundry drying in the sun. It was like I had stepped back in time, and I was happy to be lost in this labyrinth.
Eventually, I managed to find my way back to civilization, but I wouldn’t have regretted getting lost in Alfama. Navigating through the district’s twisting streets turned out to be a memorable experience.
Exploring Alfama district is an unforgettable experience of getting lost in a labyrinthine of narrow streets and it’s one of the most interesting neighborhood designs I’ve ever seen. After all, getting lost in such an ancient area is not a bad thing, but a chance to explore its wonders one inch at a time.

When we began planning to relocate to Portugal in 2022, I was excited for the opportunity to ditch my car and use public transit — especially trains — to get around.
And for the most part that's what we've done: we don't own a car, and we get around the center of Lisbon by public transit, with the occasional bit of frustration when a bus arrives late or a metro carriage is packed to the brim with commuters.
Comboio Portugal's trains can get you around most of Portugal without too much difficulty, but we were disappointed to discover that there were no easy routes out of Portugal and into Spain — much less into the greater continental system of trains that crisscross Europe.
But what do I mean by an ""easy route?""
The main issue is that — due to a limited number of train schedules — it is not possible to travel from one end of the peninsula to the other without an overnight stay somewhere near the middle. The limited number of departures — and indeed the speed of the route itself — mean that it's not possible to do even if you catch the first train out of Lisbon or Barcelona early in the morning.
Badajoz is a Spanish city in the ancient and contested border region of Extremadura (Estremoz in Portuguese). It’s a medium-sized city that seems to be well-accommodated, with historical relevance dating back to pre-Roman times.
But key to our attention is the fact that Badajoz is the current nexus of Portugal's train service, Comboio Portugal, and Spain's primary rail carrier, Renfe. Here the two services join at a small but functional station.
But your problems originating from Lisbon actually begin before you reach Badajoz, at a small city in Santarém called Entroncamento.
Entroncamento is where the relatively-fast Intercidades train service from Lisboa Oriente switches to the slow, frequently-stopping Regional service from Comboio Portugal. There are no direct trains from Lisbon to Badajoz, and you must switch at Entroncamento, with the same being true going the other direction.
The Regional service from Entroncamento is on a small, two-carriage train that makes 16 stops along the way and takes almost 3 hours to make the journey between Entroncamento and Badajoz. It's not entirely uncomfortable, but it is not fast, and the stops are frequent. But they are also some of the most charming stops along the route, and they offer some of the most beautiful vistas of Portugal's interior.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is likewise beautiful. It's accomplished on Renfe's Alvia service, and is much more comfortable than the journey between Badajoz and Entroncamento. The Alvia has comfortable, assigned seats, air conditioning, and a cafeteria car. It's much more like the Comboio Portugal Intercidades service, and it offers gorgeous views of Spain's snow-capped Sierra de Gredos mountains.
Gazing out the window of either the Renfe or CP trains, it's easy to imagine the Iberian countryside of Hemingway's cock and bull stories — gentle brooks that wind past the ruins of old stone fences, among low-slung green hills dotted with the outlines of black bulls and cork trees. This scene blends uninterrupted on either side of the border for a 100km stretch, making it impossible to know which country you're in.
On the Portuguese side of the line, I saw a farmer with a plow yoked to a mule, manually plowing the soil with equipment that Iberian farmers have used for a thousand years. I could barely believe my eyes.
Our goal is to reach Barcelona, and we don't mind leaving on the earliest train out of Lisboa Oriente. And in all of our scenarios we will select the fastest services available.
That will be the 07:39 AM Intercidades (IC) departing from Lisboa's Oriente station. Oriente is a lovely station that's easy to navigate and can be reached from the Lisbon Metro's red line. The IC ride from Oriente to Entroncamento is the shortest leg of the entire journey, clocking in at a little under an hour and placing you there by 08:30 AM assuming everything goes right (it often does not on Comboio Portugal).
Here you have a few moments to top off snacks and water and locate your train to Badajoz. The Entroncamento station is pretty spartan and has limited facilities, so it's really best to get anything you'll need for the entire stretch to Badajoz before you leave Oriente.
In Entroncamento, you switch trains onto the slow-rolling and frequently-stopping Regional service departing at 09:06 AM. This train has two cars and unassigned bench seating. It's far from comfortable and at 3 hours it can be a test of patience.
By the time you roll into Badajoz at 12:54 PM you will have lost an hour crossing the Spanish border.
You will also need to find some way to occupy several hours, as the next train departing for Madrid is at 05:43 PM on Renfe's Alvia service.
Here is where a key decision emerges on your trip from Lisbon to Barcelona — spend a long evening and night in Badajoz, waking the next morning to catch the first train to Madrid at 08:16 AM, or continue on to Madrid, arriving at 10:39 PM, where you will spend the night and have many options for reaching Barcelona the following day. Your choice basically comes down to: where would I rather sleep?
The good news, I suppose, is that 10:39 PM is a perfectly acceptable time to find a meal in Spain, where dinners often do not begin until 9:00 PM or later. But if you are already tired, Badajoz seems to have plenty to offer and — at least as far as I can tell — would not be a bad place to spend the night. And spending the night here would certainly allow you to eventually roll into Barcelona a little earlier in the day.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is a little under 5 hours whether you take the 08:16 AM or the 05:43 PM, but it is comfortable, with the Alvia offering assigned seats and both 1st and 2nd class carriages. There is a well-equipped cafeteria car and frequent trips up and down the aisles by the food cart.
Assuming that you decided to spend the night in Badajoz and take the 08:16 AM Alvia the following morning, you would arrive in Madrid a little past noon, and would then have many options for traveling on to Barcelona. All of them can be on Renfe's AVE high speed rail service, which was slightly nicer than the Alvia service and comparable to Comboio Portugal's Alfa Pendular high speed service.
This is the route I actually took a few weeks back. It was long — and I made the trip hung over from a night of drinking with colleagues in Barcelona — but it got me home.
As with the trip originating in Lisbon, we want to get as far as possible in a given day, so we don't mind leaving early. During my trip a few weeks ago, I intentionally chose a later train as I knew the earliest train out — at 5:50 AM — would be too early for me, and as we'll see in a moment, sacrificing sleep to get out as early as possible is not going to do anything for getting home faster when going west.
The AVE service is nice and fast, with comfortable seats that you can select in first and second class. I bought a first class seat because I wanted to be as comfortable as possible with a belly full of last night's cocktails — not that it helped much as the train jostled from side-to-side as it chugged slowly out of the ancient Catalonian principality.
The countryside here looks a lot different than it does coming from the west, but during this time of the year it was beautiful. Fruit orchards (I couldn't tell if they were cherries, plums, peaches, or some other variety of stone fruit blossoms) were in full bloom, creating rows of pink and white blossoms that striped the countryside all the way to Madrid.
The AVE service should drop you in Madrid at a very respectable 9:10 AM. But the problem is that on most days, there are only two trains departing Madrid for Badajoz: 8:30 AM and 4:17PM. And you've already missed one of them.
So you must again ask yourself where you'd prefer to spend the night.
Even though it feels like you haven't made it very far, there's a strong case to be made for spending an evening in Madrid vs. Badajoz. Madrid is a major city with many restaurants and attractions that can be used to blow your time. It's almost worth it just to exit the train station here so you can see the beautiful edificio of Madrid's Puerta de Atocha railway station. But there are also museums, parks, the botanical gardens, and more just a short distance from the station.
I chose to spend the night in Madrid and got a small room near the train station so that I could pull out on the first train to Badajoz the next morning. Given the hangover, I did not do any sightseeing. But you're smarter than me and won't have that particular problem. Right? I did eat some of the worst croquettes I've ever had that night.
Sorry Spain — Portugal's are just better.
That first train leaves at 8:30 AM, and at least for me, navigating the train station was a little confusing, so I suggest leaving yourself enough time to figure out how to get to the right train. The arrival and departure terminals are in separate buildings, so make sure you go to the right one.
The Alvia train to Badajoz is fine, with all of the amenities you need to be comfortable, but with slightly less-comfortable seats than the AVE even in first class. It speeds along just south of Spain's Sierra de Gredos mountains. With their snow-capped peaks, they make for a gorgeous backdrop to the aforementioned cow pastures and cork trees. It's a little like Texas hill country, but with some very serious hills.
By the time you reach Badajoz at 1:34 PM in the afternoon you will have made a 5 hour haul across the Iberian peninsula, but it places you in Badajoz with enough time to catch the trains on to Lisbon, where you will pick up an hour as you cross the border.
The first train to Portugal departs at 2:09 PM in the afternoon, so you have a bit of time to get snacks and water before moving on. If you miss it, there's another train to Lisboa Oriente station at 7:41 PM, but it obviously puts you in Lisbon much later at night (after 10:00 PM). This may not matter as much for a tourist, but as I was eager to get home to my family, my calculations were always focused on getting home as early in the day as possible.
Both services require taking the slow moving Regional service to Entroncamento — the reverse of what I described in the first westward-bound trip — and switch to an Intercidades service for the final leg of the journey to Lisbon's Oriente Station.
The Regional service to Entroncamento sits on an inconspicuous track that's on the perimeter of the main platforms. It's clearly labeled as a Comboio Portugal train, and when we arrived I assumed it was the train I needed to board. But we were made to enter the terminal anyway, and not permitted to re-enter the platform until its scheduled departure.
The Regional service to Entroncamento also departed late, but the conductor mostly made up the time during the trip. It was interesting to observe the people getting on and off along this route. Many of its stops were extremely rural, and I saw a mixture of different commuters: cyclists fully-decked in their cycling gear who brought bicycles aboard and got off after a few stops, grannies with grocery bags in either hands who rode the train for just one stop, and younger folks who looked like they were taking the full ride for a weekend of partying in Lisbon. Sometimes the conductor stepped out to help the older passengers on or off the train with their grocery bags or boxes, and it was easy to imagine that this cast of regulars were people he knew well and saw multiple times a week.
We arrived about 10 minutes late and discovered that CP had held the outbound train to Lisbon, allowing us to board and make the 4:52 PM arrival time in Lisbon.
This was much to the current passengers' consternation, but much to my relief and gratitude.
While I'm glad I made the cross-peninsular trip by train, it's not something I would want to do regularly. Nor, perhaps, would I want to do it with a large family and lots of luggage in tow.
But if you have a few days to burn and nowhere better to be, and you don't mind a slow moving tour of the Iberian countryside, this is an excellent option.
I should point out that overall the cost of the trip was actually comparable to a round-trip airline ticket. The Portuguese leg of the trip comes out to about €25 one way. The leg between Portugal and Madrid is another €45. And a first class ticket on the AVE between Madrid and Barcelona, in either direction, comes out to about €119. This is all in one direction.
If cost is your limiting factor — and especially travel time — air travel makes more sense.
But there are plenty of good reasons to take the train if you can: reduced environmental impact, the ability to get up and walk around to stretch your legs and take in views, choices for food and drink in the cafeteria cars, and beautiful views of the countryside are all compelling reasons to consider travel-by-train. And while the trains (at least in Spain) require you to run your bags through a screening process, it was nothing compared to the headache that is air travel in the year 2025.
I'd like to see more options for getting places by rail, so I try to take the trains whenever it's feasible. My hope is that the more we use trains, the more countries see the demand for expanded routes and increased optimization in existing routes.
While I might not take this route frequently, I'm at least comfortable in the implications that it brings and can pack and plan accordingly. And if you believe the hype, plans are in the works to bring high speed service between Lisbon and Madrid. If accomplished, this would result in something like 3 hours of travel time between the peninsula's capitals and would make getting on to Barcelona in a day an easy feat.
But I'm afraid the Portuguese cynicism for major works like this has already worn me down, and I'm not expecting this to be the case any time soon.
Even if I don't plan on going from coast to coast, I know I can make it from capital to capital in a single day, and that's a thing I might try to do more often now that I've done it once.
And maybe at some point, I'll make the cross-peninsula trek and just keep going — into France and the heart of Europe. But that's a feat for someone with way more time on their hands than me right now.

Lisbon is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and Portugal’s main centre of education, economy and culture. Its picturesque alleys of Bairro Alto and the fancy boulevards from Rossio to Tejo are just a fraction of places to go and see during the day. And by night, you’ll hear traditional Fado tunes coming out of every bar, inviting you to join the vibrant nightlife. Lisbon’s atmosphere is overall an exciting mix of fast-paced city life and Mediterranean flair that provides the needed balance between work and life.
But when you go off the usual streets and places full of tourists, you may experience a whole different side of Lisbon, one that isn’t mentioned in any common guide and for outsiders quite difficult to access. Without knowing the right places beforehand, it’s practically invisible. I talk about Lisbon’s rising underground scene of secret Chinese restaurants.
“You probably mean the „illegal“ Chinese. There are three of them close to Martim Moniz. One at the end of the street Beco da Oliveira and two are in a building in street Rua do Terreirinho (number 40 if I remember correctly).” — Henning, Erasmus Student from Lisbon on Hubble
The most prominent spot for such restaurants is around the metro station Martim Moniz in the neighborhood of Mouraria. They are often hidden in apartment buildings and back alleys, and the more you proceed into the side streets of Mouraria, the creepier it gets.
“I’m not pretty sure about the name of the restaurant but I think it is Chinês Clandestino. As the name says, it is a clandestine restaurant, so it’s like a secret spot to have a nice meal. Here you have the address: Mouraria — Rua da Guia, 9, 2 Dto, Mouraria, Lisboa. Have fun!” — Daniela, World Citizen on Hubble
The friendly and colorful Lisbon you once knew (well, a few minutes ago) is gone. Streets are plastered with garbage instead of the azure blue Azulejo tiles. Now, heated discussions in all kinds of languages come in place of the relaxing, traditional melodies from the Old Town. You would love nothing more than to turn around, hop onto the metro back to Bairro Alto and quickly forget about your unsuccessful adventure, but the goal is already within your reach. You can’t go back now, can you?
“There are two in Rua do Benformoso 59. Just knock on the door on the 1st floor or try the one on the 2nd floor.” — Nanxi, Foodie on Hubble
You wind up standing in front of a slightly rundown house. The door is open most of the time and leads to a dark hallway. It feels like you’re in a movie…No, not the one’s with a happy ending. You dare to go upstairs. The smell of food fills your nose but the fear of getting kidnapped and waking up tomorrow without a kidney is the only thing you can think of.
Nervously, you read the number of the apartment where you have to go from a little, crumpled-up piece of paper which you got from your Airbnb host. It’s the right place. You gather all your courage and knock on the door. You regret it, why did you even come here, you should have gone to McDonal — … Suddenly, an old, Asian lady opens the door and invites you warmly in. Although you don’t understand a word, it feels like everyone is very kind to you. Maybe this isn’t so bad at all. At least your organs are safe.
In the restaurant, it’s a completely different world. A bit modest, but clean, traditional and cozy. A few people are having dinner, others play ancient board games. The old lady sits down and continues to watch a TV show while you proceed to one of the 8 tables in total. There’s no pressure. You sit down, choose a meal and after all the stress you get rewarded with incredible amounts of tasty food at a good price. Regular restaurants have nothing on the unmatched dishes and familiar vibe. It’s like you would eat at your grandparent’s home, well if your grandparents should be from Asia and… I mean you get it.
I can’t recommend those places enough. Instead of going to the same locations over and over again, you should try one of these secret restaurants. It’s an exciting part of everyday life in Lisbon and when you want to see its true nature while having a cheap night-out, this is it!

Like most children, when I was very little, there were things in our house that I was not allowed to touch. Things like the grandfather clock in our living room, which I was told would fall over on me. Or the record player, which I actually did touch, and did break the stylus on, and which never worked again. And of course common dangerous kitchen things like the stove, oven, or kitchen knives.
But of all the things I was not allowed to touch, the weirdest and seemingly most harmless one was a small, gray, leather-bound case that my mom kept in her room. It was about the same size as one of our encyclopedias, but thinner, and had a handle for carrying. The brass latches kept both sides of the case firmly closed. At the time, it felt like the perfect child-sized suitcase for pretending I was going on a trip somewhere. “Aloha! I’m off to Hawaii with my cool little suitcase!”, I might’ve pretended. Except that I definitely was not allowed to use this little case as a prop.
But within this tantalizing little case was something special to my mom. Something she worried I would either damage, or lose the pieces to, or spill something on, or maybe she just thought I’d swallow a piece. It was a backgammon board; a game my mom would later reveal to me in the hopes of having a partner for playing. But she would be disappointed, as it turned out, because backgammon is kind of confusing for a kid.
While we tried to play a few times, most of our games ended in mutual frustration, and for the time being I decided backgammon was boring and not something I wanted to learn to play.
The trajectory of gaming for me was not a straight line from my first encounter with backgammon to rediscovering it decades later. As a kid I played a lot of the basic Milton Bradley and Parker Bros. stuff — Monopoly, Trouble, Guess Who, Clue — and as I entered my junior high years I began playing tabletop role playing games. During weekends in high school, I would go to a tennis meet, then head to a friend’s house at Fort Polk where half of our team would engage in UNO or Risk and the occasional groan-inducing session of Axis and Allies.
It wasn’t until I was in early college, and I met my friend Lyle, that I got into what were then called “European-style board games”: Ticket to Ride, Puerto Rico, Game of Thrones, and more. The vast world of tabletop gaming — with its myriad choices of engines, strategies, settings, and pleasant little game pieces — opened up to me and hooked me. It was revelatory.
After I got married in 2010, I introduced my wife to the world of adult board games, and she got into them as well. By 2012, we were hosting weekly game nights at our house in Atlanta. My wife would prepare a delicious meal for everyone, and we’d kick things off with a warmup game like Citadels, Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards (we lovingly call this game Wizards of Skullfuck Mountain because none of us could be bothered to remember the name), or something else that played quickly. Then we’d eat, and get into the real main course — a good multiplayer board game— which might last for 2–3 hours.
This went on for many years until the complications of life finally intruded on everyone, and we had a kid.
Around the same time in 2012, I was being introduced to the ancient Asian strategy game of Go by a coworker. I was fascinated by the simplicity of the game, but continuously challenged by its complex strategies. At this point I was mostly dabbling — we’d play a few games on a mobile app each week, but eventually I changed jobs, we lost touch, and I didn’t think about Go for a while.
Then in 2014, I got an itch to play Go again, and got a physical Go board and pieces and brought them to work. I sat it on my desk and friends and I would take turns playing throughout the day. One day an outside consultant I had hired walked by my desk and noticed our Go board and revealed that he was deeply into Shogi and Go. This let to a renewed interest in Go for myself, and an introduction to the intricacies and deep strategies of Go for some of my coworkers. While some of them got deeply into it (one of them is now the head of Atlanta’s Go Club and a highly-ranked player), I played occasionally but did not invest a lot of time in practicing. Consequently, I am not very good at Go but I still love the game.
Fast forward to 2024. I still love games. And our daughter does too. Among her favorites are Splendor, Azul, Ghost Blitz, and chess. A lot of my free time in Lisbon is spent sitting at the park quiosque reading, writing, and drinking a cold beer on a nice day. While the kid runs circles around the quiosque with her friends climbing trees and playing tag, my wife and I sit at the quiosque’s small tables making small talk, looking at our phones, or planning out the week’s activities. Sometimes friends join us, and when they do there is plenty of good conversation to keep our brains occupied. But when it's just us, it's nice to have something to do beyond just chatting.
This got me thinking about small games to occupy ourselves. It's not unusual to see people playing cards, but I don't love the way cards occupy your hands, and I honestly don't really enjoy most of the two-player card games. I thought about Go, but I have consistently failed to get my wife interested in Go, and with its hundreds of small pieces, it could make for a real mess if the kit came open accidentally or a pigeon decided that one of the pieces looked particularly tasty. Then I thought about dice, but I don't know any simple games involving dice.
But then a thought entered my mind: what about backgammon?
Backgammon has its own portable case and is available in very small form-factors.
Backgammon is for two players.
Backgammon has limited pieces to lose.
Backgammon has a relaxed pace, and allows your hands to be free to smoke or drink.
But what I couldn't remember is anything about playing it, so I started doing some reading and watching some videos and realized that backgammon was actually pretty easy to learn, but that there was ample room for strategy. Things clicked and finally fell into place for me, and I thought that I'd like to order a small backgammon set to try.
I found what appeared to be a nice, travel-sized set on Amazon Espanha: a travel set from Yellow Mountain. As we had a trip coming up to Alcaide for the Festa de Cogumelos, I knew my wife and I would have an opportunity to play for a few days: during our time relaxing at the hotel.
For two people on the move wanting to learn to play, it was a good set. The Yellow Mountain set is probably overpriced, but it’s nice for anyone looking for a travel-sized board. When fully opened it lays flat on a table, has a felt game board, and the checkers are magnetized, making it easier to keep up with them. It comes with a set of backgammon rules. My only real complaint is that the miniature dice feel cheap, and that the magnetized checkers sometimes make them hard to stack.
After our arrival at the hotel, we sat in the lounge and played for several hours while we had drinks and snacks. I explained the basics of the game to my wife and she quickly caught on.
Since then, we’ve played hours of backgammon while we're at the quiosque, but we have also started playing more at home. We are having a great time challenging each other and figuring things out for ourselves. It’s so nice to have an interesting, casual game to play while we hang out at the quiosque. I’m looking forward to having it this coming spring and summer.
And there's a lot of strategy that we have yet to discover. We didn't begin using the doubling cube — a dice that effectively lets both players bet on the outcome of the game in order to win more points — though we eventually added it into play and have slowly started to increase the number of points needed to win a game (we're up to 9 points now). But the doubling cube absolutely adds another element of strategy to the game.
Neither of us has yet to score a gammon or backgammon, which occurs when one player manages to ""bear off"" all of their pieces out of their home board before the other player has a single piece in. Most of our games wind up being very close, and I'm confident there are strategies we are overlooking for blocking each other from scoring. The defining moment of each game is always when one of us gets our last piece past the last opponent on the board, at which time it becomes a race to bear off all of our pieces.
For Christmas, my wife bought me a nice, handmade home board from a Greek company called Manopoulos — it's gorgeous and the pieces and game board are so satisfying to hold and touch! It's too big for the quiosque, but that's okay. It's a wonderful board to use at home and we look for any opportunity to pull it out and play a few rounds. It’s something that will be in our family for years.
And you know what? I’ll probably let my daughter touch it, though thus far she has shown little interest in backgammon after watching us play many rounds.
I’m glad I remembered that little suitcase from my childhood, and that my mom at least tried teaching me a game that — although I didn’t find interesting at the time — I would remember later in life. It at least made backgammon a possibility in my mind and made it an option to consider when I was looking for a casual, portable, strategic, two-player boardgame.
I think my mom would be happy to know that I rediscovered backgammon and learned how to play. And I'm glad I did! The gameplay is the perfect pace for nice days at the quiosque.
And when she eventually returns to Lisbon for a visit, I look forward to surprising her with my knowledge of backgammon, and playing a few games with her at the quiosque over a cold beer.

21st August 2013 Lisbon, Portugal
The ship’s engine whirled, shook and rattled to a stop as outside, the crew scuttled about to pull thick ropes around the metal structures on Lisbon’s port to hold the cruise ship in place for the day. The sun’s rays enveloped the entire city from the top of the mountains, over brightly-coloured houses all in pastel, before reaching over one magnificent church standing tall at sea level.
“Lisbon was a city full of history and culture. Many buildings and markets were kept as it was a hundred years before, portraying the old ways of life.”
We went ashore after having breakfasted on the ship and rode a century-old tram around different city quarters, with assurance from the driver that this tram line was used as regular transportation in the city.
The tram climbed up steep hills and slid down narrow alleyways as if following a secret passageway that only our driver knew of. We passed the old quarter with houses worn down and looking like slums, but still had beautiful glazed tiles in their façade that were used immensely as decoration in the olden days, giving blue, green, turquoise and red patterns to entire buildings, making them stand out from their plain, pastel-coloured neighbours.
As the tram rattled past the main train station, it occurred to me why the architecture looked a little bit like home. Coming from Thailand, I was familiar with the fact that Portuguese culture influenced a lot of Thai culture during the time of King Rama V (in the 19th century), where the King had commissioned Portuguese architects to design many buildings during the time of his reign. One of the locals explained that the king of Thailand indeed came to visit Lisbon once, meeting the King of Portugal in the very same train station that our tram moved past.
We reached a huge open square surrounded by magnificent white columns of the city’s biggest theatre, the monument of King John of Lisbon atop a horse, as well as the palace walls that ran along the length of the square. The tram stopped long enough for all of us to have a glass of port wine and a Portuguese egg tart (pastéis de nata).
“Port was traditionally drank after a meal in Portugal, a habit taken up by the British people, but twisted by the French: they enjoyed their glass of the sweet red port as an aperitif before meals.”
This Portuguese pastry was also familiar to us Thais — creamy egg tart with a consistency similar to that of crème brulée, encased in a crispy, flaked pastry shell sold at the side of the roads. But the Portuguese version has a touch of cinnamon, which gave the tart a special and more complex aroma and flavour. The combination of freshly made, warm egg tart and cool, smooth port is thoroughly enjoyed in Portugal as a breakfast pastry or mid-afternoon snack with coffee.
One of the most famous places to try these gloriously crunchy, buttery tarts in Lisbon is at Pastéis de Belém
A café stood in the corner of the square, where one of the locals pointed out to us that it has been operating there since the 1700s. It was mid-morning, but the café was packed with customers having coffee and a golden, thread-like dessert called Fios de Ovos . Another familiar sight, this dessert is thought by many to originate from Thailand and called Foi-Thong (golden thread), however it was the Portuguese that first made it.
The dessert was another Portuguese delicacy which was shared by many far Eastern cultures when the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, sailed across the Indian Ocean and created a new trade route in the 15th century.
The tram started up again, winding its way down to a huge moastery that stood close to the harbourside, its walls running 500 metres across the gardens in front, close to the sea. If you came to Lisbon, this was a must-see sight as the monastery was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Inside the dome-like structure which loomed high above us, were altars of Jesus Christ and tombs of the king and queen. The main altar was of European influence, with paintings of the Lord, Mother Mary from the Renaissance period, but the tombs of the long-gone royals were supported by Indian elephants, showing further the fascination with Oriental cultures the king of Portugal at the time had. Inside this church also lay the tomb of the explorer Vasco da Gama.
Lisbon is a big city and half a day of exploring was simply not enough.

Situated in one of the most beautiful squares of the world, the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio, most commonly known as Rua Augusta Arch, is the monumental gate that connects Lisbon to Tagus river.
The construction process of this Triumphal Arch, the emblematic finishing element of the buildings that constitute the former Terreiro do Paço, was long and certainly not controversy-free.
Supported by grandiose columns it is topped by a set of sculptures that carries a lot of meaning.
Today it is one of the tourist attractions of the city and a must-visit place for the Portuguese as well as for foreigners, as it provides a stunning 360-degree view over the river and the Pombaline Downtown.
After the devastating earthquake of 1755, it was necessary to rebuild the entire downtown area of the city. For that a team of engineers and architects was formed and was led by minister Marquis of Pombal that under the rules of the Reformist Enlightenment movement created a new modern, rational city with a classic and simple style, the Pombaline Style.
The monumental Praça do Comércio was built over the former Terreiro do Paço. The royal palace that used to exist there since the 16th century and that collapsed was solely symbolically replaced by the equestrian statue of King José I.
The square, composed by buildings with arcades, is perfectly symmetric and has two towers both on the east and west sides, while the south side faces the river and the north side faces the new city. The Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio, the noble entrance of Lisbon, was projected for the north end since the beginning.
The first project, by Eugénio dos Santos, was classic and simple and was approved in 1758. It was a round arch sided by statues in niches, with a triangular pediment and topped by a sculpture set.
In 1762 the architect passed away and was substituted by Carlos Mardel who presented a new proposal. More connected to a baroque model, this proposal replaces the pediment with a tall bell tower and a clock, decorated with pinnacles and flame-shaped sculptural ornaments.
Just like the previous one, this project long awaited its execution, seeing that the economic resources of the kingdom were being destined to more important works.
With time passing by, the political context as well as people’s tastes changed and new ideas arose, which triggered a heated discussion among the people of Lisbon.
Thus, the execution of the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio was successively delayed. First due to the withdrawal of Marquis of Pombal from the government in 1777 and later due to the political and economical instability that resulted from the civil war in the early 1800s.
However, in 1815 the support columns were built and only in 1873 was finally inaugurated the monument projected by Veríssimo José da Costa, a solution that merges the best of the two previous proposals.
From Eugénios dos Santos he chose to include the sculpture sets, as well as the classic lines and balanced proportions; from Carlos Mardel he included the clock and placed it facing north, while the south side features the coat of arms of Portugal. Plus, he added a baroque style with the rococo decoration that surrounds them.
Veríssimo José da Costa kept the already built base but discarded the triangular pediment from the two previous projects, replacing it with a rectangular structure that corresponds to a wide hall, where we can see the clock mechanism, as well as a superb view from both the large lateral windows.
The sculptures present in the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio resulted from an iconographic programme from the French artist Célestin Anatole Calmels (1822–1906). This artist executed, among others, the emblematic works of the Allegories on the sides of the portal of Palmela Palace and the sculpture set of the pediment of the City Council of Lisbon.
On the south side of the arch, the artwork on the top level was executed by the Portuguese romantic sculptor Victor Bastos (1830–1894), author of, among other pieces, the monument of tribute to the poet Luís de Camões, situated in the Square named after him.
They are the colossal allegories of the rivers Tagus (west side) and Douro (east side) on the sides of the building; and two pairs of statues that represent four important figures of the History of Portugal.
While the representations of these same rivers in the statues of Liberdade Avenue are harder to distinguish, here they’re more clearly identified. The statue on the east side features a bunch of grapes, which we immediately associate to the Demarcated Region of Douro, instituted in 1756 during the governance of Pombal. On the opposite side the Tagus seems to have had an object on its hand, but whatever it was is now broken.
When it comes to the statues, from left to right we can find: on the west side, Viriathus (181 BC-139 BC), the mythical leader of Lusitanian people, followed by Vasco da Gama (1469–1524), the navigator and explorer that discovered the sea route from Europe to the East.
On the east side, from left to right we can see Marquis of Pombal (1699–1782), who was responsible for the development of the country and for the reconstruction of the capital. A figure that certainly wouldn’t have had a place here if the arch hadn’t been built so belatedly. Finally we see Constable Nuno Álvares Pereira (1360–1431), an equally important personality of the History of Portugal and Lisbon and founder of the Carmo Convent.
Four personalities from different times and of distinct qualities but all certainly related to the allegories on the top of the arch: Valour and Genius crowned by Glory.
This last stone sculpture set presents us three figures: the middle one is standing and represents Glory, who is holding two bronze bay crowns on top of the head of two seated figures next to her.
Below them we can see the inscription: “VIRTVTIBVS MAIORUM VT SIT OMNIBVS DOCMENTO. P.(ECVNIA) P.(VBLICA) D.(ATVM)”, which means: By virtue of the Greatest, so that it may serve everyone as a teaching. Dedicated to public expenditure. ”
On the west side we can see the female figure of the goddess Minerva wearing a plume helmet and holding a sword, with a lion resting by her side. On the two sides of the helmet are presented two small winged dragons, which remind us of the symbol of the House of Aviz.
The roman goddess Minerva, associated with the greek Athena, is the goddess of wisdom, strategic warfare and the sponsor of arts, hence being connected to Valour.
Genius is here represented on the east side by the god Apollo with books and a lyre. In this case the beardless young figure has wings, which connects it to the Christian figure of the Archangel Michael.
On top of one of its wings there’s a discreet small figure of a philosopher that we hypothetically associate to the roman writer of the 1st century BC Virgil.
The symbology of the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio, the Equestrian Statue of King José I, the Cais das Colunas and even the dimensions and proportion of the Square and of the buildings that constitute it, have been targets of interpretations that tend to emphasise its masonic and esoteric character. We leave these reflections to the specialists.
To finish off, we must suggest you visit the Triumphal Arch of Praça do Comércio that has been open to the public since 2013. You can access it in Rua Augusta by going on an elevator and then going up a few stairs. You’ll have access to a terrace where you can admire the stunning view.

You know what they say, right? It is very easy to come to Lisboa, but to leave this city is very hard. In the next few months, you will spend in this ‘ ‘, you will find out that this could not be more true. To get familiar with the place you can call home for your Erasmus semester, Cidade Linda here are some of the highlights you can — and should — not miss.
You probably noticed them in your new neighbourhood: These small restaurants or local cafés can be found throughout the city. Start your day by ordering a strong ‘ bica’ and a pastel de nata. You cannot leave Lisboa without trying this combination out and, chances are high it will even become your daily routine!
Besides supporting your local pastelaria, check out Manteigaria as well. There are two: one in Rua do Loreto and one in Lisboa’s Time Out Market. This food market is also great for getting a bite or a drink during the day or evening.
When you are done exploring the city and head out to Belém, the place not to miss for the best pastéis de Nata (this is plural of ‘ pastel de nata ‘ by the way, which is good to know in case you want to order more than one) is Pastéis de Belém. Easy to recognise because people line up in the street, but it’s worth the wait. Trust me!
On a Tuesday or Saturday, take a stroll through. Feira da Ladra is a secondhand market, up in the area between the Graça and Alfama neighbourhoods and is a must-see as well. It is a great place to go treasure hunting and find a truly special souvenir to bring home: uniquely illustrated postcards, plates with a 70’s design, but also vintage shoes or old leather bags. Enjoy a walk back to the city centre from here, and you will notice why they say Lisboa is built on seven hills right away.
One of the best places in town to get a drink with a view is Park Rooftop. When you haven’t been there before, it can seem a bit strange to enter a random parking garage for a drink. But, just take the elevator all the way up and you are at the rooftop bar. It can be hard to get a table but try going during the day and enjoy the view on the Ponte 25 de Abril. This place is also nicest views over the city must be highly recommended when the sun sets or for parties at night.
There is a lot to see and do in the city of course, but when the temperatures rise — and believe me, they will — check out the beaches nearby. Easy to reach by train are those of Carcavelos, Estoril and Cascais. Another great one is Costa da Caparica, on the other side of the Tejo river. Take the bus from Praça da Espanha and you can be in the ocean just forty minutes later. Perfect, right? And, since you are there, you might as well try a surf lesson.
A night out in Lisboa starts here. Meet your friends at the nearby Praça Luís de Camões and head into one of the small streets to buy a cheap drink at one of the bars. From here, you can easily walk down, towards the river, to the Cais do Sodré area later that night. Here, the bars and clubs can be found in Pink Street. Not the official name, but the asphalt is actually painted pink. Try some of the streets around it as well, just follow the crowd and enjoy your drink out on the streets!
Another thing not to miss is LxFactory. Try to go on a Saturday and have a look at the market at this former threads and fabrics factory, but any other day is nice as well to go here for a drink, lunch, brunch and do some shopping. Oh, and you should definitely check out Livraria Ler Devagar, an amazing there. Hundreds of books cover the walls — both, new and second-hand — which make space not only nice to see in real life but definitely Instagram-worthy as well.
Check out the concerts and other festivals that LX Factory organises, there’s always something going on. they organise at LX Factory too, there are some cool events going on.
Just follow these six tips, and you will slowly become more of a local in your new city. In the next few months, you will undoubtedly have tons of tips to add to the list and understand even more why you can never really leave Lisboa.
Truth is, moving to a new place shouldn’t be stressful. Book a new home online with Uniplaces.

“Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life.” ― Fernando Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet
Lisbon, the city that illuminates history and culture, has been the soul city of some great writers. After years of traveling vicariously in and around Lisbon through José Saramago’s novels, I was finally there!
My first visual of Lisbon was through Saramago’s tour de force, ‘The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis’ —
“The sea ends, and the earth begins. It is raining over the colorless city. The waters of the river are polluted with mud, the riverbanks flooded. A dark vessel, the Highland Brigade, ascends the somber river and is about to anchor at the quay of Alcântara.”
The eponymous protagonist, Ricardo Reis, one of the many heteronyms of the modernist poet Fernando Pessoa, returns to Lisbon amidst political turmoil in 1935 after 16 years of exile in Brazil. Ricardo Reis strolls around Lisbon’s boulevards and narrow streets, observing the changes that…

I’ve learned that big cities are a hassle no matter where in the world you travel. If you have a rental car, driving in European urban centers is incredibly stressful. That’s why I chose to ride the bus into Lisbon and let someone else deal with traffic.
My base in Óbidos offered a simple solution. A comfortable bus picked me up less than a five minute walk from my Airbnb and dropped me off in Lisbon city center one hour later for $8. Best deal of the trip I’d say.
One of the first things you learn about Lisbon is that the city you see today is relatively new (by European standards). On November 1, 1755, a powerful earthquake leveled much of Portugal’s capital. An ensuing tsunami and fire increased the devastation. More than 35,000 people died. At the time, Lisbon was one of the largest cities in Europe.
Ruins of the Carmo Convent in central Lisbon were preserved as a memorial to the earthquake. Today the site appropriately serves as an archaeological museum. Stone arches inside rose to an open sky, providing silent testaments to the day Lisbon crumbled.
Legend has it that Lisbon, similar to Rome, was founded on seven hills. There were incredible views out over the city from the top of each hill but you had a workout hiking up and down each one.
I found that Lisbon was an interesting mix of modern and an almost whimsical past. Rickety trams clicked and clacked their way up the hills as electric cars whirred by.
It was a great city to just wander rather than trying to hit a list of major sights. You were bound to get lost anyway in the winding streets of the old town. Rare for Europe, the city’s commercial center actually had a grid-like street plan built after the earthquake.
I’d compare Lisbon to San Francisco in the States. Both cities are on the ocean, have hills and trams. Both suffered devastating earthquakes. Lisbon even had a suspension bridge spanning its bay that resembled the Golden Gate.
I peeked inside this store for Portugal’s national football (not soccer) team. Led by star Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal is still alive in the current World Cup. When the team is playing, life pretty much comes to a standstill here, with everyone gathering around their TVs. Portugal’s historical rivals include Brazil, Spain and France.
I jumped on a local train to go a few minutes down the coast for a visit to the Belém neighborhood in western Lisbon. A massive monument to Portuguese explorers was built there as a nod to its place as the point where ships departed Lisbon.
Belém also housed Jerónimos Monastery, erected in the early 1500s near the launch point of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama’s first journey. Da Gama became the first European to reach India by sea after he sailed around the south of Africa at the Cape of Good Hope. His remains were interred in a prominent carved tomb in the nave of the monastery’s church.
Da Gama’s discovery and the subsequent Portuguese armadas that sailed to India for spices helped build the small country into a serious world power in the 1500s.
So much of Portugal’s history and culture, its national identity really, stem from the Age of Discovery.

Curiosities:
Did you know that Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in Western Europe, predating other European capitals such as Paris and Rome? Its history dates back over 3,000 years, making it a living testament to the passage of time and the resilience of its people.
Climate and Best Time to Visit:
Lisbon enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and warm summers. The best time to visit is during the spring (April to June) and autumn (September to October) when the weather is pleasantly mild, and the city is adorned with blooming flowers and lush greenery. Summer (July to August) is also a popular time to visit, despite the warmer temperatures, as it coincides with festive events and lively street celebrations.

Myths and Legends:
Legend has it that Lisbon was founded by the ancient Greek hero Odysseus during his epic journey home from Troy. According to myth, Odysseus was so captivated by the beauty of Lisbon’s natural harbor that he decided to establish a city on its shores. While the origins of Lisbon may be shrouded in myth and folklore, one thing is certain — the city’s allure is as timeless as the stories that have been woven into its fabric.
Typical Phrases:
As you wander through the streets of Lisbon, you’ll often hear locals greeting each other with “Bom dia” (Good morning), “Boa tarde” (Good afternoon), or “Boa noite” (Good evening). These simple phrases reflect the warmth and friendliness of the Portuguese people, who take pride in extending a warm welcome to visitors from near and far.
Cuisine and Culture:
No visit to Lisbon would be complete without indulging in its delectable cuisine. From savory bacalhau (salted cod) dishes to sweet pastéis de nata (custard tarts), Lisbon’s culinary scene is a feast for the senses. Be sure to sample traditional Portuguese dishes such as grilled sardines, caldo verde (kale soup), and arroz de marisco (seafood rice) at local eateries and family-owned restaurants. As you savor each bite, you’ll gain a deeper appreciation for the rich culinary heritage that defines Lisbon’s gastronomic identity.
The people of Lisbon are known for their warmth, hospitality, and love for music and dance. Fado, Portugal’s soulful musical genre, holds a special place in the hearts of Lisboetas (residents of Lisbon) and is often performed in intimate venues known as fado houses. The haunting melodies and heartfelt lyrics of fado songs capture the essence of Portuguese culture and evoke a deep sense of emotion that resonates with locals and visitors alike.
In conclusion, Lisbon is a city that invites you to embrace its history, savor its flavors, and immerse yourself in its vibrant culture. Whether you’re strolling along the cobblestone streets of the old town, admiring the intricate azulejos (ceramic tiles) that adorn buildings, or simply sipping a glass of port wine while gazing at the sunset over the river, Lisbon will leave an indelible impression on your heart.

Traveling abroad can seem daunting, overwhelming, and complex on the surface, with so much to worry about what can go wrong. But traveling embraces our commonality with other people, and traveling can be simple and fun. This publication answers the question of: What can go right?

Long before cities like Paris, Munich, and London began to emerge, one Western European city stood above the rest. Known for its culture, elegance, and community, this city was developed on seven hills surrounding the beautiful blue-teal waters of its harbor and beyond. Known for Fado music, melancholic and soulful melodies through song illustrating histories of social marginality and transgression. And known for their Pastéis de Belém, delicious custard tarts in which the original recipe is still a mystery. Combining the benefits of sharing the same climate as San Diego while also remaining as low cost as Midwest America, this complicated, picturesque, and attitude-changing city of Lisbon, Portugal, exemplifies how geography shapes a society. Modern geologists and sociologists have fiery arguments on whether geology shapes society or whether the societies we create affect which type of geology we settle in. And while a combination of both seems to be the truth, Lisbon highlights how not only geography shapes a city but how geological events change the philosophy, community, and culture of a city and its surrounding society.
HOW GEOGRAPHY SHAPES SOCIETY

A hidden gem in the western end of the European continent: This is Lisbon, a city full of beauty and poetry.
Located over seven hills alongside the Tejo river, Lisbon is attracting tourists, college students, and residents from all places.
The city is one of the oldest cities in the world and was first named Olissipo, founded by the Greek hero Ulysses after the Trojan War, according to an old legend. Lisbon’s streets of cobblestone, ancient ruins, and beautiful cathedrals transport the traveler through a thousand years of history, wars, and conquest.
Today Lisbon is flourishing with culture, music, restaurants, and concerts, mixed with nice weather and affordable prices. Visiting Lisbon, try their delicious fish and seafood cuisine. In June, sardines are grilled on barbecues on every street in celebration of the St. John’s bonfire festival.
Hop up for an adventure going to Belem Tower on a tram ride, and don’t forget to eat the delicious Belem Pastries. As the country’s capital, Lisbon holds worldwide cuisines reflecting its residents’ countries of origin. Great places to eat are the…

The last time I was in Europe was in 2019 when I went to Web Summit Lisbon: the world’s largest tech conference.
I have the chance to be back in Europe this summer, funnily enough, in Lisbon again.
Turns out I really like coming back to places. I’ve got to reflect on the (massive) personality changes I’ve had since 2019… as well as the things that really haven’t changed (spoiler: I still get really loud when I am enthusiastic. And I have a very low bar for things that make me enthusiastic… things within life are just SO worth raving about).
My recollection of Lisbon in 2019 was entirely fantastical. I didn’t have one bad thing in my memory… I even forgot about all those stairs. Youthful bliss.
Adulthood comes with new features: some are good (wine at lunch) and some are not so good (an adult culture of complaining). This second time in Lisbon has me reflecting on my sense of adventure and open-mindedness from before. While places do have their downsides, overall, I think the big picture of life is generally quite positive; it’s something that adults lose track of among the millions of opportunities to be negative.
For example, Lisbon has many (many!) stairs/hills, but it’s also filled with stunning view points. I could complain about the stairs or I could appreciate the sheer fact that you can see the ocean, castles and millions of portuguese roofs from the centre of Lisbon.
Anyway, this is the start to yet another ramble about how great it is to be an optimist: to see the world for all its amazingness. While this is not a complex sentiment, it can be overruled with our primitive software (i.e., our brains looking out for danger) or the primitive software of other adults looking out for danger.
Let’s remember that the commodities of the 21st century are things the wealthiest of the 19th century couldn’t even dream of buying.
I’ve used the phrase zest for life over the last few years to ground my optimism for the world. I’ll attempt to inject this zest within the 5 lessons I learned (or re-learned) after my recent last 9 days in Lisbon.
While I was walking up a huge hill towards Jardim do Torel I noticed a very peaceful grandma sitting on a bench with her feet dangling and her hands doodling. The skies were perfectly blue and she was all cozy on the cobblestone road tilted 45 degrees.
There’s something so pleasurable about watching someone pursue their life for themselves, despite other expectations or limitations from terrain.
Similarly, my friend Jake writes a great and intense newsletter about golf, and while I am the furthest thing from a golf fanatic, I love reading his newsletter. He is so passionate and unapologetically a golf nerd that it’s just refreshing. It’s cementing to see someone else pursue their interests so boldly.
I like spotting the bullet-journaling grandmas and Jakes in the world.
It’s an art to pay attention and find these gems. But, if you look close enough, you’ll see many happy people and their passions flowing through their veins.
Our brains get easily flagged down by negative, ugly or scary things. I think the world is more kind than it is mean (re: Factfulness) but our minds have a huge distortion to notice the few mean things rather than the many kind ones. But with the art of attention, you can see beyond this distortion.
I’m a big fan of spotting cute things. Cute puppies in strollers, cute families with grown children… all wearing matching bucket hats, cute cartoons on fancy menus, cute babies with fat cheeks. It’s like a renewable resource of serotonin.
I even feel happy running around Lisbon in circles. Recognising spots from last time and places I’ve walked around a bunch this time.
Attentiveness allows me to log a street I’ve walked on such that when I walk on it again, it gives me a dose of familiarity: a very popular neutron-firing-pattern for the human brain.
I try to be attentive to all the Portuguese words, to recognise sounds and phrases, let them become familiar tunes instead of being drowned by the foreignness and communication barriers.
Essentially, there’s always a positive twist on my surroundings if I’m attentive enough. I derive a lot of happiness from hunting.
I’ve noticed a lot of people phrase their wishes in the past-tense:
These “wishes” are just regrets rebranded. I think the utility of regret is its ability to learn for or reframe the future. Why not reflect on regrets briefly, and then make wishes for the future?
Have wishes that aren’t regrets but plausible ideas:
Better yet, make these wishes more specific so that they’re not just theoretical.
Other than reflection, I see no reason to wish from the past. I see no reason to hold grudges. I’d like to learn from the past & pay it forward without dwelling.
One of my lowest points during this trip was when I was really tired and made a snap judgement about someone else. It’s inexcusable and not something I do often (thankfully), but also not something I’m immune to. It was a low point because I was really disappointed in myself.
I reflected and realised that I have my snap judgments in moments of desperation or insecurity. It’s not a them problem, it’s a me problem.
eople live lives with different compasses. They might achieve things in their lives I wish I could emulate or have, but instead of looking within myself for why I don’t achieve those things, I judge them to compensate for their gains with a loss. Basically, I will lower one element of themselves to feel less jealous.
I think this is a really rotten mentality. Lessening someone else to feel more secure yourself.
I believe I should appreciate subjectivity, i.e., respecting other people’s lives to co-exist with mine. Realising my beliefs are not objective and binarily correct, enjoying my life but not at the expense of how others want to live theirs and supporting other humans without being too pushy on my agenda.
Part of this journey has been internalizing that every human has something I can learn from. Everyone. They may lead vastly different lives than me but surely I do not have it all figured out.
Philosophically, my higher mind agrees with the notion of subjectivity and respect. But my monkey-mind can uncontrollably judge when it feels in danger.
I’ve been reading Tim Urban’s book “What’s our problem” and it’s undoubtedly inspiring these reflections of higher and primitive minds. The architecture of our brain is soooo ancient while the world is sooooo new; having a deep understanding of both is vital to co-existing in them sustainably.
Ancient = hunter-gatherers running from lions. New = can use a device built in 40+ countries to connect to the world wide web to click a button to borrow a bike for 10 minutes. These are very different scenarios!
The monkey inside my brain can mistake good, kind, different people with a lion trying to eat me. It will panic, judge, run, scream and desire a banana for extra running energy. And when it turns out that the person is in fact uninterested in having me for lunch, the monkey will be embarrassed it was wrong so it will use cognitive dissonance to rationalise how the perfectly fine human was actually a lion 10 seconds ago through the magic of animal-morphing technology that obviously the monkey catalyzed to relieve the threat.
I hope that’s enough of a vivid scenario to illustrate how silly our minds can be. Hence, I am working on a three-pronged approach to combat monkey-mind judgement:
During a conversation at Bahr Bairro Alto with Ula and João, we chatted about a random person pursuing a wealthy life in the more ‘traditional’ route. We’re a group of people who thrive on the unconventional route, so it was interesting to discuss someone with similar ambition but a different approach.
I just assumed this person was pursuing wall-street… because that’s what most people I know who want to make a lot of money do. But then they were both like no: think bigger.
I didn’t know there was something bigger than wall street? Turns out there’s a category well beyond wall-street that takes more insider information. Wall Street just has a good brand. Like Gucci (known luxury) vs Zegna (less known, but more luxury) or Rolex (known luxury) vs Patek Philip (less known, but more luxury)…. It’s a luxury so luxury that it’s off the market.
I liked learning this a lot since I get such a high off of learning about less-mainstream paths and more rare experiences.
This concept of thinking beyond the ceiling is so appealing. Our conversation added a new anchor within my pursuit for an interesting and status-quo-challenging life.
I have a very Serbian dad which means after his obedient medium-sized dog comes his stick-shift 2010 car with nearly 300,000 km logged. He taught me how to drive a manual car.
However, it turns out that driving on flatland & wide Canadian roads is VERY different from hilly, 1800s cobble-stone, windy, tiny Portuguese roads!
But you know… I did it and learned a lot.
There were many miracles along the way. Like how our Peugeot managed to go 120 km/h in 5th gear without falling apart, only getting a handful of honks and successfully avoiding all instances of parallel parking (big miracle, you have no idea).
We also had not 1, not 2, not 3 but 4 Portuguese people actively get in the car, demonstrate some of their manual car life lessons & help with hill-starts or parking. 3/4 were complete strangers who stopped everything to get in the driver seat, not kidnap us, and share their wisdom. Their helpfulness was such an asset and is one of the things I’ll really remember about this trip. It’s an energy I’d like to share more in life too.
Another thing I’ve noticed in Portugal that parallels my Serbian culture is how much people like to feed each other! Contrast to Asia, portions are VERY generous. It never feels like someone is optimising their margin. While this isn’t the most business-forward, life-wise, I really enjoy the vibes of the anti-stinginess. Essentially, I don’t want to make my wealth by selling the least amount of salmon for the highest possible price.
It’s been a really beautiful time… and in what feels like another full circle, I’m off to London, the place I was supposed to go in April 2020… :)
I’m grateful for the strings of the world and for your attention… now go enjoy something around you :)

Book Review: “Two Nights in Lisbon” by Chris Pavone,https://zachary-houle.medium.com/book-review-two-nights-in-lisbon-by-chris-pavone-8717045f03c8,"Sign up

When Chris Pavone’s Two Nights in Lisbon was initially published in hardcover last May, there was a great deal of pre-release hype behind it. I got a print galley, a digital galley, and then a finished copy of the novel — which all came to me by the publisher without much prompting on my part if I’m recalling things correctly. Thus, it seemed like the publisher was particularly interested in promoting this one quite heavily from my perspective. But that’s not all. The book was generously blurbed, and quite gushingly, by several A-list American authors, including John Grisham, Stephen King, and Megan Abbott. Grisham and King, in particular, trumpeted the fact that this was a novel that you couldn’t put down. Indeed, this is a bit of a page-turner — if you don’t mind thinking about taking a nice hot shower as you read this. The thing with Two Nights in Lisbon is that it is more than just an effective thriller: it has something important to say and the ultimate subject matter of this novel is quite unsavory as it might be topical. I don’t want to reveal too much for those who have yet to wade into this book, but, suffice to say, I found myself putting it aside at certain moments because the real crime presented within it is so repellant and distasteful, if not violent, that I needed to take a break from the mechanization of this tome’s harrowing plot.
The novel is about a newlywed couple who are vacationing, sort of, in Lisbon, Portugal. I say sort of because it is also something of a business trip for the groom, John. However, he goes missing one morning and his wife Ariel immediately goes to both the police and the American embassy to get them on the case. Neither, of course, is of very much help to her. Then, she receives a phone call: it turns out that John has been kidnapped and Ariel has 48 hours to pull together three million euros in ransom to have him returned to her alive. Ariel, of course, doesn’t have that kind of money, but she happens to know people in her social circles who might. That is, of course, if they want to help her out — and they might have their reasons for not wanting to. And thus begins a bit of a cat-and-mouse game of double-crosses and requisite plot twists, and, naturally, the CIA winds up getting involved — which shouldn’t be saying too much as this is something mentioned near the beginning of this book.
Does that sound like a good premise for a thriller? It does to me, too. However, Two Nights in Lisbon veers off into unpredictable territory even though you can kind of figure out what’s likely to happen before it happens. This doesn’t make the book a less-than-stellar read; quite the contrary. This is a well-done slow burn, and the novel does go into important territory that has been covered by many thrillers being released these days: those that detail violence that is implicit against women. To that end, Pavone does a masterful job of creating a believable female protagonist who is quite vulnerable, but who does her fair share of fighting back against all sorts of injustices that are done to her. That’s probably the big selling point of this novel and what makes it so immensely readable. Having said that, though, this is also a challenging read because the book’s subject matter is bound to make readers quite uncomfortable. Thus, Two Nights in Lisbon is not an easy book to take. While it is a relatively quick to flip through even at being more than 400 pages in length (and it is a quick read because of its semi-predictability, which is a pleasure of its own and keeps the narrative moving), it could have been trimmed just a little bit. It feels a little overlong, with an epilogue that feels a bit tacked on to give this book a mercifully happy ending. (Or as happy of an ending as you could expect from a book such as this. This is not to say that I’m not happy it ends the way it does, but these characters really go through the wringer and there could have been, perhaps, a little less of that in the lead-up to the end.)
In the end, I’m not sure how far I would go in recommending Two Nights in Lisbon as a must-read novel. It is very well done, but it made me squirm. The writing is top drawer for being genre fiction— flaws are damned. And the book does have them: you can’t think of the twists and turns too hard, or the plot kind of comes undone. Without meaning to spoil anything, it turns out that the kidnappers go to an awful lot of trouble just to achieve their ends — though, at the same time, they must go to the lengths they go to. (For this reason, I guess I’m of two minds about this book.) In any event, perfection is always hard to come by, so we should be very satisfied with the care and craft that Pavone has put into this novel about the ugliness of American society and how women tend to get treated within it. Overall, Two Nights in Lisbon is going to appeal to readers who like their thrillers to thrill, but perhaps not too much. Me? I liked this, but didn’t love it — and the reason is that I now feel as though I have to have that hot shower to rinse away the griminess of the major crime that is ultimately revealed here. Two Nights in Lisbon is worth a look, but just be prepared to go against what those A-list writers were raving about. This is a novel you’ll want to put down now and then. You’ll need to just get through the repulsiveness of the female protagonist’s unfavorable experiences throughout this troubling yet searing work of genre fiction.
Chris Pavone’s Two Nights in Lisbon was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux / MCD on May 24, 2022.

I was traveling in Lisbon. That day, I went to an old restaurant listed in the Lonely Planet guidebook. A guitarist was playing traditional Portuguese music. Tourists from all over the world were drinking wine and talking, their faces bright with laughter. I had a few glasses of wine.
I began to feel the buzz. I grew tired of the place and left.
I kept walking. Not along the routes tourists take, but deeper into the old city. There were no pretty buildings. The walls were faded, and the windows sat still in the dark. The road wasn’t smooth — just an uneven path of small stones and rough cobbles. Every step caught my toes. I kept losing balance.
As night deepened, dim streetlamps flickered on, one by one.
Women stood along the roadside.
Drunk, I approached them. I stopped in front of one captivating woman. I wanted to say something. She didn’t understand me — but she named a price in English. “Want to fuck,” she said. I couldn’t understand anything else she said.
I couldn’t afford the full price. I handed her a bit of money, then turned and walked away.
I approached another woman. Did the same — gave her money, then left. I just wanted to talk to someone.
I kept stumbling forward. The streetlamps swayed.
After midnight passed, fog began to settle.At first it hung loose, then thickened. It sank heavy into the pitch-black streets. Every shop was dark, shutters pulled tight. My sight blurred, then slowly vanished. I couldn’t tell street from wall. I walked with my eyes on the ground.
There was no one around. Once in a while, a car passed. Its headlights flared into the fog — then faded without a trace. The dampness clung to my skin. I kept walking, aimless. I didn’t want to stop.
Around dawn, the fog began to lift.A narrow alley appeared. Beer cans. Torn snack wrappers. Soggy paper cups. Traces of someone who had been there through the night. But no one remained. No women. No cars. No sound. No people — just what was left behind.
I was tired. I headed back to my room.
Morning was coming. The street had changed. Taxis and buses passed in steady rhythm. The green leaves of roadside trees glimmered in the morning sun.
At an Indian restaurant, the shutter rolled up with a loud clatter. Workers carried boxes inside, turned on the lights, and scrubbed the floor. The scent of spices filled the air. Metal pots clanged, hoses sprayed water, voices echoed. Everything was waking up again.
People walked. Shops opened. The day had begun.
And in the middle of it all, with sunken eyes from a night spent in the street, I quietly walked back to my room.

I’m going to go ahead and assume that 2 Chainz was visiting Lisbon when he made that song. Ok…..maybe that’s a stretch, but seriously this city is literally vibrating with some of the best energy I’ve EVER been around. And I’m one of those hippy-dippy, “I need to feel the aura, the mojo, the vibe”… whatever you call it, to get a sense of whether I’ll like something. AND THIS PLACE GIVES ME ALLLL THE FEELS.
The best way for me to describe it is to actually borrow from my home office, Havas Chicago. We have 3 major tenants of what it means to be a Chi-town Havaser, they are: All In. Clever. Heart.
You can tell that every single person in the Lisbon Village is beaming with pride for their agency, clients and country. They proudly represent some of the biggest companies in Portugal.. a leading grocery store, a major bank and even the train system. I’m helping out on NOS, one of the leading telecom accounts in Portugal. About a year ago, NOS came to Havas and said they wanted to completely re-invent the brand. Havas answered in the most ALL IN way ever……creating Havas Different, a culturally relevant, hyper-village focused model designed to service NOS. The team re-invented the way they work, so that NOS and Havas can fulfill the collective vision and grow together. WOW!
As a strategist, I know that clever insights are both hard to come by, but also imperative to doing good work. My mentor, Joao (The Head of Strategy), and the other strategists in Lisbon have it down pat. The insights they bring to the table are simple, yet poignant and surprising, yet delivered in a way that makes you feel like you knew it all along. For example, when NOS tasked Havas to create a campaign for the Christmas season, the team came to the table with most clever insight around the most prominent fixture of the season, Santa. They asked themselves: if we live in 2018, where technology rules our lives….why are we still writing letters to Santa? So, they created a campaign all around the idea that Santa MUST have a phone number and NOS was going to bring it to you. Again, WOW! (smart insight jealousy rushes all over).
Upon arrival at the office, I was immediately greeted by Maria José (a beloved receptionist). She and the others taking a smoke break immediately flashed me smiles, grabbed me for a typical Portuguese double cheek kiss and proceeded to start teaching me Portuguese phrases I needed to know. After that, my mentor Joao took me around the office and introduced me to everyone….again👏🏽 every 👏🏽single 👏🏽person got up from their desks, gave me a double cheek kiss and was ready to teach me about their agency and culture. Before the day was up, I was invited to take a walk all around downtown, view the amazing sunset from the River and try a shot of Ginginha, a trademark drink in Portugal. They welcomed possibly the most stereotypical American, midwestern girl with open arms and big smiles. Again, WOW (tear of happiness streams down cheeks).
So, like I said, it’s truly a vibe here. It’s hard to put into words. I can’t even do it justice, but I’m OBSESSED and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.

Lisbon is a stunning city.
While it might be true that 1-day only is almost nothing for you to see the beauty of it, sometimes 1 day in Lisbon feels like a lifetime.
If You are planning a visit for the city, or even if you have no idea on what to expect.
I Got You!
Lisbon, the Portuguese Capital is a metropole, but when compared to other big cities, such as NY or London, it has a slow atmosphere. It feels like you’re in a fisherman’s village along the river.
Even in a slow way, it works as a big city, it’s a capital where You take 10 steps and listen 10 different languages.
People form all around comes to here, and you’ll probably never run out of things to do.
After all If we’re being honest here, the city is almost never “sleeping”.
Especially in the summer, when one part of city is going bed while the other is waking up.
Lisbon can be a lot even in just a few days.
Crazy as it sounds, as a Tourist Guide the thing I like to do the most in the city is…

It’s a question I’ve been asked countless times since moving to Lisbon from Lagos. Sometimes it’s asked with genuine curiosity. Other times, it feels more like a challenge — a polite way of saying, “You don’t look like you belong here.”
But the truth is, I’ve been asking myself the same thing, too.
When you leave home — really leave it — you don’t just pack a suitcase. You carry your culture, your accent, your rituals, and your invisible expectations. You try to wear them lightly, but they cling to you in moments you least expect, like when no one laughs at your jokes, or when your food smells “too much” in a shared kitchen.
What I didn’t expect was that losing my cultural footing in Portugal would help me discover who I am.
Growing up in Lagos, everything felt loud and alive. The streets were full of stories. There was always a neighbor knocking, a generator buzzing, a market woman shouting the price of tomatoes like it was breaking news.
I loved it. And I also wanted out.

I fell in love with Lisbon probably on the day I was born, even though I never got it until I started to travel through the world.
When I started traveling, I began to look at my city with the eyes of a tourist, and that's the best way to find some hidden secrets or to look at places where you normally just pass through without even looking.
I’ll just share with you some 5 places not to miss in Lisbon and help you get as enamored with my city as I am.
Lisbon is such an old city that one of my favorite neighborhoods is older than Portugal, being over 100 years old.
It’s one of those more typical neighborhoods in Lisbon where you can Fado houses and still see a bit of an old times type of life, with a thigh community in the middle of a big city.
It had become a very touristy place in the last couple of years, but it’s still possible to get lost and find some old stores, where you can find fun trinkets.
Fado is part of the tradition not only in Lisbon but specifically in this neighborhood, where you can find a “Casa de Fado” almost in every corner.

MeetnGreetMe together with our amazing travel blogger would like to share memories and some tips with you in case you have been thinking about visiting Portugal for a long time, or just decided to go there an hour ago! Today we will explore the best of Lisbon, Porto and Sintra. Together with Anastasia.
“At the beginning I will give you some general information about Portugal. Portugal shares borders with Spain and it’s the most western country in Europe — sounds interesting, am I right? If you want to have a condensed view of European landscapes, culture and the way of life, Portugal might be one of the best options for you. I have been there twice and I am sure I will go there again. My both visits were in February (Yes, it sounds cold but believe me, even in February it’s +18 and sunny…and nothing can spoil your time there).
I have visited only Lisbon and Porto and some small villages nearby (for me it is better to visit fewer cities but to feel them, rather than explore the whole “Europe on two feet a day”. That is why today I will tell you about these 2 cities.
How to get there?
As it was a planned trip, I booked flight tickets in advance (Warsaw-Lisbon-Warsaw) and it was only 80 euros (which is very cheap I think). From Lisbon to Porto I travelled by bus — 4 hours and 20 euros- may be you will find a cheaper way to get there, but I didn’t have enough time for it and used a simple intercity bus.
Lisbon is the capital and the largest city of Portugal. Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world, and the oldest in Western Europe. There are a lot of tourists all year long and you have to be prepared for much attention (especially if you are a woman), tasty food, good wine and hospitality….let’s go!
I will tell you about places I have visited and advice YOU to visit!
Rossio Square (Pedro IV Square)
Lisbon’s most famous square. There’s no better place in Lisbon to soak up the local atmosphere than at Pedro IV Square. It has been the city’s main gathering place since the Middle Ages. Today, it’s the place where friends meet up and as a result it’s always crowded — you will not miss it.
Monument to the Discoveries
It is the mammoth white-stone Monument to the Discoveries. Do you all remember Vasco da Gama- the first European to reach India by sea….Yes-yes, he was from Portugal. Now you understand why they have this monument and so proud of it. You can ride an elevator to enjoy the view from the top of this Lisbon landmark.
Alfama
The oldest quarter in historic Lisbon, the Alfama district is dotted with architectural landmarks and it’s the charm of the neighborhood’s meandering streets, tasty food and wine, clubs with Fado (amazing music) that make the Alfama a can’t-miss destination.
And one more life-hack — Tram line #28
The historic “tram” takes you through the city’s oldest sectors past some of Lisbon’s most popular sights and attractions. You don’t have to pay extra money (the ticket costs like a normal one — 3 euro).
Belem Tower
Belem Tower, also known as the Tower of St. Vincent, this statue was designed to protect sailors on their voyages, faces the river and makes an incredible impression on you.

I finally made it to Lisbon — bright tiled streets, salty breezes off the Tagus River, and the unmistakable smell of butter and sugar from the bakeries.
And there it was — pastéis de natas — the flaky, creamy, caramelized, and still warm pastry.
I had one on a street corner in Belém and thought to myself, ‘Yeah, this is one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. For those that may not know what it is — think about a croissant and creme brûlée mixture (it tastes like heaven!).
But somewhere between that first bite and the tourist-packed café I wandered into next, a strange feeling crept in. And it wasn’t for Portugal, but rather for Seabra’s.
If you know, you know: Seabra’s is a Portuguese supermarket in New Jersey. For me, there’s one just over the Goethals Bridge.
Seabra’s is loud, a little chaotic, and smells like chouriço and old linoleum.

If there is one thing we understand, it’s the importance of your student accommodation towards your general student experience. What’s more, we know a huge factor is your student home’s location. You want to live in one of the best neighborhoods, one that’s just as perfect for you as your residence. If this is you, let us guide you through Lisbon’s best neighborhoods for students!
Definitely one of the best neighborhoods for students, it’s very, very popular with international students. Marquês de Pombal is known among the locals as the central business district of the city and also as a major transportation hub. With two metro lines crossing here, and something like 20 different bus lines to catch, you’re always just a shot away from any place in the city. During the day, catch the sun up in the Eduardo VII gardens and after nightfall head down to the Kiosk-bars of Av. da Liberdade for drinks with your friends. There are many student residences nearby, including several that are Erasmus exclusive. Check out our student accommodation in Marquês de Pombal.
An Erasmus favorite! If you don’t want to have to go to parties, but prefer the parties to come to you, rent a room in the Bairro Alto. From Thursday to Saturday, the crowds fill up every one of the tiny bars here and spill out onto the streets. Thankfully, it’s quiet enough during the day, so you can party as much as you want throughout the night and then spend your mornings taking it easy inside. Friendly warning, you guys: Bairro is for party-animals only. Check out our student apartments and studios in Bairro Alto.
The large avenue (Alameda d. Afonso Henriques) that gives this area its name has a very wide garden with plenty of places for taking in Lisbon’s great weather and a kiosk-bar where you can have one of the coldest — and cheapest — glasses of beer to cool off. The streets to the sides of Alameda have plenty of student flat shares that are popular with Portuguese students, especially students of Instituto Superior Técnico (- called IST, or Técnico, for short). Click the link if you want to check out some student shared apartments in Alameda.
The neighbourhoods of São Sebatião and Saldanha are between three of the main universities of Lisbon: Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Nova), Universidade Católica de Portugal (Católica) and Técnico. It is not surprising, then, that you will find a student in nearly every building of the area. Some places like Bairro Azul are almost entirely occupied by students. It has great transportation options, the Gulbenkian Foundation with its museum, library and gardens (useful whether you feel like art, a stroll or some study time) and El Corte Inglés, the huge department store that also has over 12 cinema rooms. Click the links if you want to browse for student apartments in Saldanha or to rent student accommodation in São Sebastião.
Alfama is not only the historical quarters of Lisbon, it’s the city’s heart and soul. This is a personal favourite of mine — the neighbourhood where I have always lived. You’ll find there is nothing more charming than Alfama’s crazy, maze-like streets, and there is no better way of taking in the city’s culture than getting lost here. At night, you can hear Lisbon’s traditional music, Fado, being sung from a hundred little restaurants. Houses and apartments are traditionally rather small and hundreds of years old, but some studios and apartments have been recently refurbished and make the perfect student homes to live in. Interested? Click the link to see student accommodation in Alfama.
Thanks for reading this post! We hope to see you soon, coming back for more.

As a product manager who has navigated through various roles and experiences, I know how important it is to connect with others in the same field. But what happens when there’s no ready-made community for product managers in your city? You build one.
That’s precisely what I did when I launched the Product Management Society in Lisbon. The goal was simple: create a space where product managers could share knowledge, network, and help each other grow. But the impact has been far more significant than I ever anticipated.
The Product Management Society began as a small meetup group. We gathered product managers to discuss challenges, solutions, and industry trends. What I didn’t expect was how quickly the community would grow. To date, we’ve hosted 50+ events and built a community of 1,100+ members from multiple countries, all passionate about product management.
Our community is more than just a group of people — it’s a vibrant network of professionals supporting each other’s career growth. We connect through our Slack group, where discussions around best practices, job opportunities, and product management challenges take place. We also have a WhatsApp group (invite-only), providing a more immediate and casual way for members to stay in touch, share opportunities, and engage in real-time conversations.
We host regular events on Meetup, from casual networking to in-depth workshops and talks by seasoned professionals.
At the heart of our society is the belief that product management is better when we learn together. From our events and workshops to our blog, we are committed to delivering valuable content and experiences for PMs at every stage of their careers.
Some of the highlights include:
We’re not just about talk — we’re about action. The Product Management Society has already made valuable connections with companies and other organizations. One of the major highlights was our hiring event with Altar.io, which allowed our members to connect directly with a top product-focused company and potentially land roles in their teams.
We’ve also collaborated with Productized for multiple events, including where our members had the chance to meet industry leaders, expand their networks, and gain insights into the latest product management trends. Additionally, we partnered with Product Weekend for another collaboration that helped our members further their careers and expand their skills.
Furthermore, we have an ongoing collaboration with Radhika Dutt, the author of Radically Rethinking OKRs, as she works on her new book. This collaboration brings exclusive insights into how product managers can rethink their approach to goal-setting and OKRs, providing even more value to our members.
These collaborations are a testament to the growing influence of our society and the opportunities we can provide for product managers looking to advance in their careers.
If you’re a product manager based in Lisbon — or anywhere else in the world — we invite you to join us. The Product Management Society isn’t just about attending events, it’s about building relationships and fostering a sense of community. By joining our Slack group, you can start contributing to discussions and sharing your experiences. You’ll also find job postings, helpful resources, and answers to your burning questions. Our WhatsApp group (invite-only) takes the conversation to the next level, offering a more immediate space for feedback and quick interactions with fellow PMs.
Our Meetup page is regularly updated with upcoming events, where you can sign up to attend. Whether you’re looking to connect with peers, gain new insights, or find your next opportunity, there’s something for everyone.
The Product Management Society also runs a blog where members share their thoughts on the latest trends, challenges, and innovations in the field. Whether you’re a senior PM or just starting out, you’ll find valuable insights that can help shape your career and approach to product management.
You can check out the blog at blog.productmanagementsociety.com, where we post articles covering everything from product strategy to career advice. Our goal is to make this an ever-growing resource that PMs can turn to for practical advice and thought leadership.
Whether you’re looking to network, learn, or grow your career, joining the Product Management Society is an opportunity you don’t want to miss. We’ve created a space that fosters growth, collaboration, and professional development.
The Product Management Society has proven time and again to be a valuable resource for product managers. From hosting multiple events to building a community that supports one another, we’ve created something truly special in Lisbon — and we want you to be part of it.
So, come join us! Sign up for our events, join our Slack and WhatsApp groups, and start connecting with other like-minded professionals. Whether you’re looking to gain new insights, find your next job, or simply connect with others in the industry, we’ve got you covered.
Also, don’t forget to follow us on our LinkedIn page for updates and more!
Together, we can make the Product Management Society a place where we all grow, learn, and thrive!

This year I had the opportunity on both attending and speak at Droidcon Lisbon, in Portugal. It was an amazing first edition filled with amazing speakers and friends from throughout the country.
Recently I was searching for the slides of one of the talks and noticed that there was no global repository with them all, so well — now there is 🙌🙂.
If by any chance you’ve got slides that I ‘m missing — feel free to comment here or just ping me on twitter so I can add them 🙂.
None of this would be possible without the Droidcon team who organized the event, the speakers, sponsors, and of course all the attendees — thank you!
See you all next year 🚀

The final day on any trip is always a bit odd as there is a more clock watching brief to bear in mind as at some point there is that need to head off to the airport, you can’t just say sod it and get the next plane instead. And there is the packing, much of which on this trip meant refolding unused clothes we had brought. Mainly because there was the idea that we would come back in the evening, get changed, and then go out for food. Which didn’t happen at all, plus there was a bit of doubling up with hot and mild weather clothing. The unused side of the main case was a lot fuller than the dirty washing side.
Breakfast was the usual lunacy. We had been noticing little oddities, but I’ve rolled them all up into a leaving day edition. There has been a man in the hotel all week. Easily recognisable as he’s about 6’ 5”, bald and shiny at the front of his head, and then a foot long mullet down the back. He’s been getting a glass (for the fruit juice) and using it for coffee, pressing the americano button on one of the machines, and then whipping the glass out before the milk is poured (there is another machine which does just black coffee). He will then disappear, leaving the rest of the family in the restaurant, and then he would be back ten minutes later to do the same coffee routine all over again. It wasn’t until this morning that we saw where he was going. He went outside and sat in his car with the door open to drink his coffee, occasionally playing with the windscreen wipers (it wasn’t raining). I’m not who was happier with this arrangement, him, or his family.
Coffee in a fruit juice glass may sound weird, but there are always lunatics trying to go one better. In addition to mullet man, I have seen someone take a bowl (which is there for the cereals) and do their coffee into that. And conversely someone using a coffee cup to put their cereals in. Additionally, the breakfast room had a little Danone fridge in the corner, on investigation, it was full of Nestle yoghurts. I thought I wasn’t a morning person, but shit, I’m a fully functioning person compared to some of these.
Anyway, after the breakfast fun and games and packing, we checked out, left the cases, and went out for our last little wander of the trip. The fact we had dressed for going home and I had jeans and a jacket on meant it was bright sunshine and no rain.
We headed to the Edward VII park. It had been set out when most of the city was rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake, but they renamed it in honour of the visit of our king to the city in 1903. And for some reason they never renamed it back after he went home. Weirdos.
The park slopes gently uphill. Of course it does, this is Lisbon. You are going to be hard pushed to find anywhere flat to build a park.
About halfway up is the Pavilion Carlos Lopez which has some beautiful blue and white tiled scenes from history upon its walls.
In front of one a woman, and her photographer friend are set up. She has six juggling clubs with bright orange ends which she is juggling in front of the tiles while her friend takes phots from differing lengths away. When I say juggling, perhaps trying to juggle would be a more accurate description. When she drops most of the clubs, Helen and I say in unison, ‘sack the juggler.’
At the top of the park’s slope is a modern sculpture to the 1974 revolution.
And in front of it is the wonderful view down the hill, back over the laid out gardens, to the statue to the Marques de Pombal (who laid out the new city after the earthquake) in the middle of the double roundabout, along the main drag of the Avenue de Liberdade beyond and then there in the distance is the river.
Having come up one side of the park we go to amble down the other side and as we do we find ourselves outside the Lisbon Greenhouse.
It is a botanical garden, and we had seen the roof from above and the side and not twigged it was the greenhouse we had seen marked on the map. It is huge.
And full of greenery you may be surprised to know.
And flowers.
None of which I know the name of. Helen does, she knows most of them, and tells me what they are. Contrary to popular belief, I do listen when she tells me stuff, but where plant life is concerned, my mind does not want to keep that stuff. Which is a bit strange considering how much utter crap it is more than willing to keep.
I did retain the names of two, but only because I was been deliberately silly about them. Apparently, Nathan wants a cheese plant. Of which there were loads here, so many in fact it was more like a cheese forest, and I would certainly be happy if there was such a thing as a cheese forest and that cheese would grow on trees.
The other being a wisteria. And that’s only because I was saying I had heard people were going mad about this flower. ‘Really?’ came the puzzled response from Helen. ‘Yeah, it’s wisteria hysteria.’ I will point out I already had my coat and hat on at this point.
It was quite interesting, and I don’t mean in an air quotes fingers kind of way. Plus I was taking the opportunity to try and get some macro photography of the various flowers done.
I don’t know what these white ones are called, but trying to get near enough to them to do a macro shot was difficult as the juggler and her photographer mate had set up in front of them and now had another hanger on with them. In the previous half an hour or so since we’d last seen them hogging things worth taking pictures of, the juggling skills hadn’t improved.
We had heard the peacocks, but it wasn’t until we were outside again that we saw them. Just strutting around and not being tortured by moronic tourists into fanning out their feathers in distress.
There was time for a last café stop, a final cappuccino and pastel de nata in the park before it was time to head back to the hotel and pick up the cases ready for the journey to the airport.
Which didn’t take as long as the journey out seemed to.
I had the camera ready for some of the station art,
and got some blurred shots, some that missed altogether, some with window reflections,
and a feeling that somehow we’d missed a couple of stations as I was sure I’d seen some much more striking examples on the journey into the city.
The journey through the airport was smooth, bag drop was easy and for a change it was Helen getting the grilling about bag contents. Security was fine, there was a bit of duty-free shopping (not that there is duty on boxes of pastel de natas, just idiot tourist premium). I had been hoping to find a Forca Portugal store, but there wasn’t one. Having gotten Sporting Lisbon and Porto pens and magnets the previous day, I thought I would complete the big three, only for the Benfica official store not to have them, and the Football Gate store to have the Sporting and Porto stuff I’d got the day before, but to do no Benfica stuff because they had their own store.
Passport control was quick, and both coming out and going back the border police have been friendly and efficient. Something that perhaps the US ones could do with coming and getting some training on.
The queue at the gate was the usual bunfight / free for all. No sort of order in being called up, just get your elbows out and shuffle slowly forward in the queue. Or do what we did and sit there and wait for the back of the queue to come to us before joining it. And then find that on the plane there was no one else on our set of three seats, and the overhead lockers were empty. Bonus. Then it is roll to the runway and away we go.
Overall the trip was great.
Lisbon is a wonderful city. There is so much to see and do and four nights is nowhere near enough time to do anything more than scratch the surface. It is good exercise too, rest assured that if you walk for more than a couple of minutes in any direction there will be a hill to climb up or shuffle down.
The food has been wonderful, and it is cheap. Everything has been really tasty, and they certainly don’t scrimp on their portion sizes (they must know people need feeding up to be able to deal with walking up all those hills). And the people are so friendly.
The Azulejos are wonderful, and there are many splendid examples of art on the tiles. Although the occasional one did make us smile for the wrong reason. This one was designed to represent justice with the scales. But all I can see is saggy tits. Which again, says more about me than anybody else.
The only downsides have been the very showery weather, which no one can really do anything about, and which hasn’t dampened our spirits anywhere near the amount they have dampened out clothes. And the attempted pickpocket / bag theft thing.
But we would definitely recommend coming back with more time to get around more of the city and beyond (Sintra is only 45 minutes away).

The History of the Siege of Lisbon by Jose Saramago (reviewed by Richard Seltzer),https://medium.com/@seltzer_57387/the-history-of-the-siege-of-lisbon-by-jose-saramago-reviewed-by-richard-seltz45-3a4214aed473,"Sign up

This is an excerpt from my book One Family, which is available from Amazon.
At the start of the Second Crusade, troops sailing to the Holy Land, stopped, by chance, at Lisbon and helped defeat the Moors, resulting in Portugal becoming a country and Afonso Henriques (our ancestor) its first king.
Jose Saramago (Nobel winner) wrote a novel with the title The History of the Siege of Lisbon, which questions historical truth in a paradoxical, philosophical, and comical style that resembles that of Borges and Lem. At the same time he tells the love story of two employees at a publishing house in modern-day Lisbon, a proof-reader and his boss.
The proof-reader, succumbing to an inexplicable urge, changes one word in a history book about the 1147 siege of Lisbon. The Crusaders say “no,” instead of “yes.” They sail on rather than stopping to help fight the Moors.
A woman hired to supervise proof-readers and prevent another such egregious error is intrigued by the implications of the mistake and by the proof-reader himself. She surreptitiously suggests that he write a novel that explores the possible consequences if that “no” had been historically true.
The narrative switches back and forth between present-day Lisbon and an alternative medieval past written by the proof-reader. His version of what happened is consistent with the fragmentary historical evidence, and is credibly told, with gritty texture and the addition of a love story that parallels his romance with his new boss. The Crusaders’ decision, rather than creating a tornado of consequences and changing all that came after, only leads to differences in how the battle is won and who deserves credit; the outcome is the same. The rip in time caused by the change from “yes” to “no” closes as if it had never happened. The fictitious version of events, created by the proof-reader, might be closer to what actually happened than the official version.
Saramago turns what might otherwise have become an academic discourse on history, fiction, and truth into an entertaining double love story that plays out in the same city, but separated by 850 years. In this book, facts aren’t as important as they’re usually represented to be. There are a few well-known fixed points on a time line, and there are numerous possible story-paths from one point to another, all of which are equally valid, because they lead to the same conclusion. By looking at more than one possible path, you come to know the characters and their circumstances with the texture, ambiguity, and shading of reality, with its dynamic tensions and ever-changing possibilities, rather than with the static view of linear historical narrative. The author succeeds in showing the heroic and passionate potential of everyday people in everyday circumstances.
I wish I could achieve such a result.

I came to Lisbon for the vibe.
What I got was a full-body workout, a minor existential crisis, and two pairs of shoes that now live in the trash.
Let me be clear: Lisbon is stunning. Lisbon is magic. Lisbon is the seductive European city that will woo you with pastel buildings, flirt with you using tilework, and then betray you with an incline so steep your knees will write a resignation letter.
This is not a walkable city. This is a city designed by and for mountain goats.
You know when a city greets you gently? When it says, “Hey, take it easy. Ease into it. Grab a coffee. Sit by the river.”
Lisbon doesn’t do that.
Lisbon hands you a map, points vaguely uphill, and says, “Figure it out, loser.”
I arrived with optimism. I had good shoes. I had snacks. I had a plan.
Thirty minutes later, I was clinging to a stone wall, sweating through my t-shirt, trying to decide if I should keep walking or roll back down into the harbor and let the Atlantic take me.

I didn’t mean to get lost in Lisbon.
I had landed with a rough map scribbled on a napkin, a backpack full of enthusiasm, and absolutely no clue how confusing the city’s steep, winding streets could be. I’d seen pictures of the iconic yellow trams, the tiled facades, and the miradors overlooking terracotta rooftops. But none of those Instagram posts prepared me for what it actually felt like to be completely disoriented in a foreign city, hungry, sweaty, and mildly annoyed with Google Maps.
It started innocently enough: a walk through Alfama, the oldest district in Lisbon, with its maze-like alleys and whispers of Fado music echoing from open windows. I turned one wrong corner, then another, and before I knew it, I was somewhere between “definitely not where I should be” and “oh, this looks kind of magical.”
That’s the thing about Lisbon — it forgives your mistakes by rewarding you with charm. One detour led me to a tiny café run by an old couple who didn’t speak English but insisted I try their homemade bacalhau. Another wrong turn led to a bookstore with poetry written on the walls and a cat sleeping on a pile of Portuguese novels.
By the time I figured out where I was (eventually — thank you, tram 28), I had stopped caring about the original destination. Somewhere between losing the route and finding a rhythm, I realized that this…

Lisbon — Abandoned Buildings,https://onetruekev.medium.com/lisbon-abandoned-buildings-544c8fc1f2f0,"Sign up

At Christmas I got several photography books in the Abandoned / Oblivion series of books published by Jonglez; Abandoned Churches, Abandoned Spain, Abandoned France, Abandoned USSR, Oblivion, Forgotten Heritage, Forbidden Places. I’ve had a look at the other titles in the series (USA, Belgium, Australia, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Germany) but was surprised to find there isn’t one for Portugal.
Having spent four days wandering around Lisbon I am sure that an intrepid urban explorer and photographer could fill such a book with examples from Lisbon alone.
There are lots of properly abandoned buildings all over the place of all shapes and sizes.
Some on the main streets of the city, boarded or shuttered up.
Peeling paint or plaster disappearing from the surface of the buildings helped along by the constant weathering.
Nature is trying to reclaim some of these for itself. There is a lot going on.
Unlike a lot of examples included in the series of books I have seen and have mentioned above, these aren’t necessarily isolated buildings. They sit in and amongst fully functioning, well kept and maintained, houses, shops, restaurants, and other businesses.
It is oddities, it isn’t like they are whole blocks left to go to rack and ruin. I may have seen one side of a street where all the buildings looked to be abandoned and on their last legs, but that was the exception rather than the rule.
To the south of the city and all the way along the bank of the River Tagus opposite Lisbon, from the April 25th suspension bridge going to the east until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
They look as if they must have been industrial units, but the whole stretch is mainly roofless, and the graffiti artists have been out in force.
It did look as if there was one little bar in amongst it all. But there was no obvious route down to get to the stretch of buildings. How would someone get there?
I am fascinated by this stretch of buildings, but as to how to get in there, I’m better off not knowing as I would just have spent a lost day wandering around the whole stretch clicking away and filling up my SD card.
And the spare one.
There are other buildings in disrepair, but they at least show signs of being worked on, metal and wooden fences surround them. There are piles of materials around, and there are cranes hovering above them.
I suppose if you went and looked hard enough in any town or city you would find examples of abandonment, but it feels different in Lisbon, I haven’t gone searching for examples, it is almost as if they have come to me. Though what I find strange now that I am home and I am searching through all the photographs I took, is ones I am sure I took of abandoned and crumbling buildings aren’t there, which makes me doubt my sanity. Most of the ones I have are of the riverside.
But I don’t speak the language and therefore don’t know what any notices on buildings may be saying. I don’t know what the law is about entering such buildings, and how the police would deal with such things. And most importantly I am on holiday with Helen, so I don’t go looking for that opening, for a chance to get inside one of these buildings and snap away.
Perhaps someone will, or there is someone already doing it, or even someone has already done it, and it is the next Jonglez abandoned series one to come out.

March 17 has passed, and the EDP Lisbon Half Marathon 2024 is over. I can share my personal impressions about the race. There was a lot of fun, but also things the Lisbon folks should work on.
The race kit was okay, including a T-shirt, a bib, a cap (an excellent choice, as you’ll see why later), a magazine, some bags of tea, a cereal snack, an electrolyte pill, and a magazine. A very useful kit.
The quality of the T-shirt and the cap was very good.
My running buddy and I chose to stay in the downtown area, near the Marques De Pombal, at the Marques De Pombal Hotel, of course.
Access to the race is limited, and you can only get there by train. All participants must use the Fertagus train to reach the starting line at the Pragal station. To access the Fertagus train stations, athletes can use Lisbon’s public transportation system (subway, buses, and trains) for free by presenting their BIB. You have to take the metro and get off at the Jardim Zoológico station to get there. From there, you don’t have to go outside; just follow the train sign to reach the train station.
While on the train, I kept looking for the “25 April Bridge” to realize that we were on the bridge, just under the road where we were supposed to be running soon. The train trip was short, about 10–15 minutes.
We arrived at the last station at 8:55, and the race was supposed to start at 10:05. We thought we had plenty of time to get to our designated start wave. I was supposed to start from Box2, while my running buddy was supposed to start from Box3.
The first thing we noticed was that the only accessway was pretty packed with many people.
We did not panic and just followed the path until we got stuck in a sea of people. We were blocked in that spot for 30–40 minutes with little information about what was happening. There were no staff or organizing people around, just some policemen blocking the access.
We also thought we had time and space to warm up, but this was almost impossible with so many people trying to get into the designated starting box areas. This was my first half marathon where I did not do any warmup or stretching, nothing. It was impossible.
This was also the first half marathon where I had to stay in line and wait for tens of minutes with little information about what was going on. It was clear we were very far from the starting area.
At some point, the crowd started to move gradually, and we managed to pass the first checkpoint. We reached a zone where someone was yelling instructions about which way you should take to get to your designated starting area. There were no signs whatsoever, just a single volunteer yelling and trying his best.
For me, this was terrible organizing. Although I was at the race one hour and five minutes before the start, I didn’t manage to get to my box in time, and I had no place to warm up!
By the time I got to the starting areas, the lucky ones had already been in the race for 6 minutes.
I started at last! But it was so crowded on the bridge that I was forced to run on a metal grill next to the asphalt car lane. You could see the water down below, and the running feeling was odd. Most runners avoided the grill, but it was the only option to get in front of other runners. And I kept running on that uncomfortable grill for almost 1-2 km, I believe.
I overcame thousands of runners since I started from the back of the herd, and two days after the race, I am still paying for that effort. Around km 8, getting in front of other runners became easy. Till then, you had to do a lot of maneuvering to get in front.
I give a big F for the start experience.
The weather in Lisbon in March is unpredictable; while in the morning it is a bit cold, clouds cover the sun, but as soon as you pass 10:30, the sun comes out and starts to shine and burn.
My Garmin watch said that the average temperature was 28 degrees Celsius (82F) during the race, with a maximum of 33 degrees (91F). The weather prediction was 24C, measured in the shade, but starting with km 9, the entire race was under a nice shining sun.
Starting with km 18, I began to count the number of people who fainted on the side, and I think I counted 10–15 of them. Volunteers and medics were trying to relieve their pain, but seeing so many people dropping out of the race kind of made me more cautious.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed this race and loved my time spent in Lisbon. I recommend visiting this city because it is very nice, has good food, is relaxed, is clean, and has many things to do. It was my second time here, and I will come back the third, fourth, and fifth times whenever possible.
In my previous post, I wrote that my Garmin watch was predicting a finish of 1:46:54, and I thought that it was being conservative. I wanted to achieve more of a 1:44 finish time. It seems that Garmin wasn’t far off from my result. I finished in 1:46:46, which is eerily accurate!
I have mixed feelings about Garmin!
I’ve added some more pictures at the end and recommend doing the Lisbon Half Marathon. It is a race designed for a PB, and you can visit a great city.
The only tip I have is to get to the starting line two hours ahead, and I’m not kidding!

To avoid the worst of the carnage at breakfast it was breakfast first then get ready to head out this morning to get more touring done. It had been raining when we got up but was bright sunshine by the time we were leaving the hotel, only for the moment we sat on the tour minibus it to want to start to rain. And we were on a minibus whose roof was broken and stuck in the open position. But we stayed in our seats and toughed it out as it went from rain to bright sunshine, back to rain and back to sun again as we went round.
We were on the green route and done the stretch from Liberatores to the Castle the previous afternoon, but this time we did almost the full route, only getting off when we got back to the second Liberatores stop and hour and a half after the first one.
And I don’t give a shit if I am repeating myself, I would not want to be driving on most of the roads the minibus travelled on. In fact I would go so far as to say that driving in Lisbon is not for me full stop, but it does lend some insight to the story of the Portuguese taxi driver we had in Leicester back in the late eighties.
There is plenty to see on the way around and it is a struggle to get anything remotely related to good photos. Between dodging raindrops, the vibrations of the cobbled streets, there are angles to consider, bus frame to avoid, and when you think you’ve got it all lined up ready to go the lights change to green or traffic clears and the bus lurches forward with some sudden acceleration.
What the results look like will be interesting viewing once back home and they have all been loaded onto the laptop.
When we got off the bus, we chose a different road to wander down to get to the river, picking one which isn’t festooned with cafes and restaurants and full of desperate men trying to strong arm you into eating at their particular offering. The number of times you can run that gauntlet without just wanting to scream at them to fuck off is limited. The one we pick has a gentle incline to it, which is somewhat of a concern seeing as we are supposed to be heading down to the river. We reach the crest of the road and find it must have been more than a gentle climb. Either that or we are getting used to the hilly nature of the city, as the road down the other side is seriously steep, and we really didn’t think we’d come up so high.
At the top there was a mall, which we took advantage of to use the facilities (that is one thing about Lisbon which isn’t great, there aren’t very many public toilets at all, and so when there are, there are always queues). I’m queuing for a cubicle only for a little brat to queue jump and run in when the old man in there leaves. I take the next available one, and whilst in there I can hear the impatient brat shout to his dad, ‘I’m finished.’ His dad tells him to wait while he himself finishes. Only for the kid to yell ‘for fucks sake, hurry up, the Lego shop is closing.’ (It wasn’t it was half twelve and they don’t shut for lunch.) Hopefully, the Lego shop became the Lego-without shop for the little shit.
The road down takes us back to the Commerce Square and across to the river. It’s time for the next tour, only this time there is no bus, it is on the river. There’s a big river and tours on the river, so of course we are there, we’re well-known suckers for a water level view of a city.
We get some refreshments, sort out the correct token for the tour (part of the HOHO ticket), and find the correct queue (not as easy as it sounds) and get on the little boat. And when I say little boat, I mean it. We had seen the larger boats for other tour companies on the river, but this is tiny, like a minibus compared to the double deckers the others are using. But even so it isn’t full.
Again the weather thinks it is funny. It was bright sunshine as we sit having a bit of lunch, the rain only appears when we set off on the boat. It does have most of its plastic splash protectors down which helps. But not with taking photos.
But the rain does fuck off to be replaced by the sun before too long.
The original route is for the little boat to go down the south side of the river on the westbound leg of the journey, but with the rain, and the threatening clouds, it stays to the north and concentrates on the Lisbon side of the river.
Being out in the vast expanse of the river gives you an unobstructed view of how the city rises away from the river and the layers of buildings of all types rising into the hills.
The cargo terminal is fascinating (to me anyway). Just how huge the container ships are, and how the containers slot together to stack up and stay in place like a giant Lego set. (perhaps drop some on this on that kid from earlier).
And there is the bridge. You can see it is large from a long way away. But the sheer scale really hits home when you are going under it.
It had looked as if our little tour boar was going to ram the yacht, but we only passed close by to it just as we were both going under the bridge, which made a decent photo.
By the time we had made our way past the MAAT buildings we had been on the day before, and out to Belem, the sun was shining.
And there were plenty of opportunities to take decent photographs of the Monument to the Discoveries.
The Belem Tower is a much better photograph from the water than from the top of the tour bus as attempted yesterday.
This is where we turn around to head back and there is a terminal for people to get on and off as even the boat tour is a HOHO. Every other passenger got off, and were replaced by a new set, and off we went back to central Lisbon.
We crossed over to the southside of the river to do so. And besides the obvious tourist photographs of the Christ the King statue, there was much that interested me.
A bit further out to the west from Belem was this, which I am assuming is some kind of refinery type building.
Just before the suspension bridge is another very colourful refinery building.
There are egg shaped structures set into the slopes of the south bank.
And once past the bridge and all the way along the bank until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
We swing back over to the north side of the river and with the sun shining on the city along the stretch of government / municipal eighteenth century buildings painted in assorted colours, and the domes and spires of churches behind them, it has a very Venice-esque look to it.
When the little boat docks at the third of its little stops we get off. The wind whilst on the water has been bitter and we have walked the short stretch back to where the loop would be complete before, so we head off to look for food and to warm up.
The pier is close to where we ate on the first night we were here, and therefore we know that the Time Out Market is only just behind the buildings we can see.
But it is chaotic in there and we want to be able to just sit and relax, order something from a menu and have it delivered to a table, not try and work out which of the forty odd options to order from and then fight to try and find two seats together somewhere in the heaving mass of humanity in the middle of the hall.
We do take the opportunity to use the facilities though. Whilst I am waiting for Helen (the queue for the ladies is unsurprisingly longer and slower moving), I see a bloke go and drag his (I assume) other half out of the queue and shove her into the unused baby change facilities toilet. Once she is in there he is pacing furiously back and forth but gradually further away, and then outside. People who actually have babies to change are now queuing to use it. I get the feeling she’s had more than enough of his shit and is deliberately taking as long as possible or just hiding. Helen comes back before she reappears, but he’s not in sight, and we go the other way. Hopefully, there was a backway out and he’s still pacing there now. Alone.
We use the guidebook to see if there are any recommended eateries near to where we are, and it does mention a place within a couple of minutes’ walk the Rio Grande. A lovely old traditional restaurant with decorative tiles on the walls and old wooden beams.
What we didn’t realise when we went in from the front door was that the side window where we were seated overlooks Pink Street.
And outside our window as we eat there is a drag act in a skintight purple jumpsuit with a long blonde wig (which keeps trying to escape) on roller skates, and armed with a wheelie bin, who is entertaining / terrorising the passing tourists.
We had found Pink Street as we had wanted, but without even trying.
The food, as all food so far has been, was lush, and after getting past the drag act unmolested, we headed back up another different street towards the hotel. Where it was a case of have a bit of a rest and then change to layer up for yet another tour. This time the night bus tour. And not a single Harry Potter in sight.
Three of the others who had been on the previous evening’s walking tour were on this tour as well, making the fullest use of their tickets as well then. But on the whole, it was a sparsely populated bus when the tour set off. Which did mean it was good for me as I could move around a bit in the hope of trying to get some decent photographs.
It starts out fine as there is still reasonable light at 8pm.
But night is falling, and it is doing so quickly.
And whereas the camera can cope with any difficulties thrown at it in daylight, at night it struggles. (or to be more precise, I struggle to be able to set it up, so it doesn’t struggle as much.)
It can cope OK when it is dead still, but as the night tour doesn’t have and pick up points around it the only stops are at traffic lights, so there is a fair bit of motion to deal with.
And as light fades the camera tries to extend the shutter speed to let more light in, which when moving means blurring.
So there I am hoping for traffic lights to be red, or for magical traffic jams to appear.
To be fair I did get some reasonable shots whilst the bus was stationary.
But the one I wanted was when the route went over the bridge above Pink Street. I knew when it was coming, I had the lens at the right length of focus, I had the timing right, but the bus was moving too quickly as there was no traffic and no traffic lights and so it ended up a bit blurry.
It is dark by the time the hour-long tour is up, and we head back to the hotel. We had seen the café on the roundabout was open as the bus came past. Two minutes later as we pass it walking back it is closed and in darkness, so it is back to the room and chill.
There are no planned tours tomorrow, just us mooching on our last full day.

After two days of being toured out, it was time for a bit of freestyling. It did still start on a bus though. A regular Lisbon public transport one, taking us down to one of the main squares in the centre of the city. Whilst waiting for it to turn up I was admiring the doors and doorways as I usually do (yes, I know I’m strange), and I saw this one close to the bus stop.
Noting the number twenty-five above it, I spent the rest of the day looking out for any other doors or doorways with the number twenty-five above them. It was a surprise just how many streets there were where the numbers stopped at twenty-three, or upon which the number twenty-five was missing from above the doorway where number twenty-five should be. Still, I got plenty for the little side project that had popped up in my head.
We were on the bus to the end of the line at Rossio, and from there we started the long slow ascent up through winding narrow cobbled streets and steps up (and some back down again thirty yards further down the same road).
Some of the streets in this area have poignant pictures attached to the walls, some project which took photographs of those who live, or used to live in the houses there and they have been reproduced onto boards in an almost sepia colour, the history from inside the walls being displayed on the outside of them.
There were a couple of stops to do some shopping for tat. The usual, pens, postcards, fridge magnets. But we made it up to the castle entrance.
Which was a lunatic asylum. The queue was stupidly long, and there appeared to be three different sub queues and people changing between them because they didn’t know which one was the correct one to be standing in.
We weren’t desperate to go inside the castle and so we wandered the streets around the castle complex at the top of the hill. We saw (and heard) peacocks. Only for some dicks to come along and deliberately spook the peacock so it expanded its tail feathers as a defence mechanism. There really are some stupid humans around.
There are also Azulejos on walls everywhere in many different patterns and assorted colours (which triggered another thought for another little set of photographs for a project).
Before we stopped for a drink in a café called Tram 28. (Named for the tourist tram which rattles up the narrow streets to the castle and always looks like a sardine tin on rails.) The inside looks as if it has been built from two trams pushed together. A drink turned into lunch and a postcard writing session before we headed on.
And it isn’t everywhere where you are going to find a Tram Burger.
Across the little square was a church, we went in one side and out the other, and briefly thought about going up the tower, but a rude German family pushed in, and we saw the cost, and decided against it.
Instead we continued wandering around the narrow streets, gradually making our way down and out of the castle complex.
We then did a bit of retracing steps, following a bit of the route down from the castle to the cathedral which we had taken on the waking tour a couple of evenings before. I nipped into the cathedral to get a fridge magnet and a brief dodge of raindrops before heading on.
And out the other side we were then walking on street not previously travelled. More narrow streets, little alleys, steep staircases up, and down, between all sorts of buildings.
Unlike the planned grid of the centre of the city, this part of the city, Alfama, the oldest part, a lot of which survived the earthquake of 1755, wouldn’t know a grid if it hit it found the face with one of the cities beloved sardines. It is wonderfully winding, and you might spy where you want to be heading, only to find a couple of minutes later that it is in a totally different direction to the one you thought you were heading in. We pick up a couple of pastel de natas to help us along the way.
It is in this style we wander the streets before eventually finding our way up to the church of St Vincent. Which is absolutely huge. And wants to charge for you to go in.
But they, as the cathedral did, have some doors available for you to go in and sit in the back two rows of the nave of the church and get a long-distance view of the inside of the church (easily overcome with a zoom lens).
The intermittent showering has turned into constant drizzle, and the back two rows of the church were a brief interlude, we stop at a café to, if not dry off, then at least stop getting any damper. A drink and a pit stop later, and it is back out.
It is still raining. We make it down to the former church of Santa Engracia. This baroque church is no longer a place of worship. It now houses the Panteao Nacional (The National Pantheon).
This time we do pay to get in, a prolonged break from the rain will be good. The building houses the cenotaphs and tombs of famous and influential figures from Portuguese history.
It is a serious space, but I can’t help it if my head is the opposite of a serious space, and seeing this name on one of the cenotaphs, I can’t help but ask does it also contain a hot dog, and a jumping frog.
A lot of the tombs now housed here were originally entombed at the Jeronimos Monastery before they were moved here in the 1960s. Reading the biographies of the people here next to each of the monuments, you can’t help but notice just how many of them went to the University of Coimbra, which must be the Portuguese equivalent of going to Oxbridge.
We are able to go up to various levels, where there are displays of reliquaries, and collected artworks.
And then we are up at the dome level. There is an exit out onto the (nearly) flat roof.
On a clear dry day, the views out over the city and the river must be spectacular. But it is neither. The April 25th Bridge and Christ the King statues are barely visible through the low cloud / rainfall. But it does seem to be easing off.
Inside the dome there is a walkway all the way around the dome. It is a long way down. My knees were going (and not just because of all the steps climbed to get up here) and the head was a bit woozy.
By the time we had made it back to ground level and had a walk around the former church and chapels looking at all the luminaries in big marble boxes (including, in a surprise to me, the footballer Eusebio), and headed back outside, it had stopped raining.
And so the wandering around continued. There are museums everywhere it would seem. To everything. In fact I think all that is missing is a museum to museums.
We find ourselves back at the river, only to turn and head away from it again and head back towards where we had gotten off the bus this morning on the search for somewhere for us to have our traditional away on holiday curry. There was a detour to find a post office so we could send the postcards we had written earlier.
Still it is trying to rain intermittently. We had seen a potential place on giggle maps and head into an alley off a side street, go up some steps for a change and find the basic looking Nepalese / Indian restaurant.
It may look basic, but the food is amazing, and it is so cheap. Two meals and two drinks each only come to thirty-one Euros. I can see why it is a 4.9 on Trip Advisor. The place is called ODAAN, it is hidden away, but definitely well worth finding.
When we come out the rain has stopped, and the sun is out. There isn’t a cloud in the sky now. And so we head for the Santa Justa lift. As we pass through the square the queue for the 28 tram is as ridiculous as it has been every time we pass here. It may be the iconic symbol of Lisbon tourism, but seriously, who wants to be Lisbon’s favourite dish — sardines — on a tram, hardly able to see out of the windows on the trip up. You’d be far better off having a slow walk up following the tram tracks and being able to see it all.
Having mocked others queuing, there is a queue for the Santa Justa lift, built near the turn of the twentieth century by a disciple of Gustav Eiffel. Only one of the two lifts in its tower are working, but the queue moves quickly enough. It connects the centre of the city with the Bairro Alto high above it.
Once at the top of the lift, the little spiral staircases up to the upper level of the viewing platform are closed, but the views out from lift level are worth the cost of coming up in it.
With the clouds having finally buggered off for the day there are magnificent views out over the city, across to the castle, and down to the river.
And behind it over the Carmel monastery which the exit from the lift takes you past.
It was one of the main flashpoints of the 1974 revolution, and it is a ruin, with little of the roof left on it. Some is used to house a museum. Unusual for Lisbon, I know.
We have been through this area on the bus but find some streets we haven’t been along to walk down (or more accurately at this point up).
The buildings are being lit up, including this theatre bathed in pink light.
There is another viewing point over the city, it is by the top of the funicular we went down in on our first night here. The castle opposite is lit up in green light, but for some reason the camera doesn’t want to know that and will only take the photo with it in an orange glow.
Once you have got past the mass of self-obsessed, selfie taking Instagrammers which plague viewpoints the world over now. Saying that we did try to take a selfie, but the reason we don’t usually take selfies is because we’re both shit at it, and the more photos I seem to have taken of me recently, the more my eyes are changing into the bastard sons of Marty Feldman’s.
The Bairro area is lined with huts serving food and drink and we grab drinks to go and head up roads we’ve been on a tour bus going in the opposite direction to.
I’m still trying to take nighttime shots of interest as we pass.
Helen mentions it would be nice to get some cheese, but there is nowhere open that sells cheese. We see a pharmacy (always a plus), and joke that it should be possible to get cheese on prescription.
We end up on another very steep downhill path, so much so they have made half the footpath into steps. At the bottom it isn’t far to get to the hotel, and time to collapse and rest.
And to try not to think that we have to go home tomorrow.

This was my fourth Web Summit, Europe’s if not the world’s biggest gathering of those plying the tech ecosystem. The conference has grown considerably since its humble beginnings in Dublin where its organizers remain domiciled. It’s not just the number of conference attendees, but its growing footprint in other regions that sets it apart from other confabs. Its portfolio currently includes Collision in Toronto, Web Summits in Lisbon, Rio and Qatar, and Rise in Hong Kong (2025).
Here are some data points from the just-concluded Lisbon event:
The record-breaking attendance happened despite the conference founder’s ill-conceived remarks on the Gaza conflict two weeks before Web Summit started. It sparked an exodus of big-named sponsors and speakers, as well as the resignation of the founder himself.
Very quickly, however, Web Summit secured a new CEO, Katherine Maher, the CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, who plugged the leaks and, within two weeks, righted the ship.
One afternoon back at the hotel, we shared an elevator with Katherine, where we had a chance to let her know how much we enjoyed her opening night presentation. She appreciated the feedback.
Since attending the final Dublin-based Web Summit in 2015, I’ve fallen into a regular cadence at subsequent events, including two on-stage moderation sessions, judging the start-up Pitch competition, participating in Mentor Hours, attending a couple of speaker dinners, and carving out time to listen to some of the more noteworthy speakers.
Two themes permeated this year’s conference: AI and climate, with the latter dominating many of the startups presenting.
On the AI front, I took the stage with Mikayel Vardanyan, co-founder of unicorn Picsart, the largest all-in-one creative platform of photo, video editing, and design tools — now fully immersed in Generative AI for creating images and video.
This is quite an impressive company with 1.5 billion downloads. Still, I had to bring up Gen AI bias after my query on the platform for a “successful business person” turned up four images — all of the same 40-year-old white man. I also worried aloud about the likelihood of bad actors using deep fakes to manipulate public opinion. Yes, that means you, Russia.
In my second on-stage session, I sat with some veteran marketing execs to discuss the changing role of the CMO. I reminisced about Y&R Inc’s “whole egg” approach wherein advertising, PR, and direct response comprised the three legs of the marketing stool. (Brand identity/design was siloed away back then.) I suggested that Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall, giving today’s marketers vastly more tools with which to work.
I suppose the greatest satisfaction for me was gleaned from connecting with founders about their early-stage companies’ plans to change the world for the better. This happened on the Pitch Stage where I judged a handful of companies whose solutions to small and big problems didn’t fail to impress. I also had a chance to mentor three young founders in the climate space: Guillaume Mandolini of EVAS, Dragan Gelevski of EarthCare.ai, and Diogo Costa of EcoCradle, who had these kinds words to share following our session:
There were other notable encounters, including over lunch when former Trump chief-of-staff Mick Mulvaney plopped down beside my wife and me. He, alongside esteemed journalist Michael Isikoff, suggested a political scenario in which both Trump and Biden drop out of the race. I wasn’t buying it.
You never know who you’ll run into at Web Summit, but everyone there had an affinity for technology and how it will continue to change our lives and livelihoods. Even Mick Mulvaney was there to speak about the tech regulatory environment.

Introduction:
In the heart of Lisbon, a city steeped in history and shrouded in mystery, magic pulses truly under the cobblestone streets. *Whispers of Lisbon* tells the story of Amara, a young historian with a gift for paying attention to the voices of the past, and Rafael, an enigmatic mother or father with ties to a historical magical order.
When their fates collide, they must navigate the secrets and techniques hidden within the metropolis’s winding alleys and get to the bottom of a centuries-old curse that threatens to consume them each.
As love blossoms amid the shadows, they discover that their destinies are more entwined than they may have ever imagined.
Chapter 1: Echoes inside the Alfama
Amara Mendes wandered via the slim, winding streets of the Alfama district, the oldest neighborhood in Lisbon.
The scent of grilled sardines and freshly baked pastéis de nata lingered in the air, blending with the faint notes of Fado music drifting from a nearby tavern.
As she traced her fingers along the historic partitions, she felt it once more — a faint, ghostly whisper that simply she needed to hear.

It was supposed to be a chill walk.
I had Spotify in my ears.Google Maps in my hand.And absolutely no idea where I was going.
Welcome to day 2 of my solo trip.Sunburnt, sleep-deprived, and 100% lost in Lisbon.
Not a premium member or account? Click here it’s free :)
I didn’t.
Instead, I kept walking.Up a street that was definitely a hill.Through a park that might’ve been private property.Past a guy yelling at pigeons.
Until I sat on the edge of a fountain, next to a trash can, and cried behind my sunglasses like a drama queen on a budget airline.
I was crying because I was tired of pretending I wasn’t.
Not just that day.In general.

We went to The Obsidian Room near the river to celebrate closing the Lisbon project.
No pricing anywhere. Dark wooden panels. Thick white tablecloths. Everything was heavy. Even the metal-sleeved menus.
Hugh was there with a few others from the team. My team. A couple of the finance lot joined. The rest were clients who’d flown over from the States.
There was champagne on arrival. Everyone was shaking hands, swapping cards, patting backs. All smiles now that it was over and I’d made them look good.
When we sat, one of the Americans started a speech in my honour. I bowed my head. Humble.
He raised his glass. “To Lisbon.”
Caught Hugh watching me, just for a second. I was on top. He knew it. Everyone knew it. He didn’t like it.
I stood, “They said it couldn’t be done. But I didn’t listen.”
A few cheers.
“You’ve still never beaten me on the courts, though!” Hugh was grinning over his glass.
A few polite chuckles. His way of getting one over me.
“No,” I grinned back, “but you’ve never beaten Lisbon.”
Raucous laughter. That shut him up.

Stories from Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking lands and cultures

Member-only story

The light lingered, warm against the cold marble arcs of the quiet convent, as I walked in. As my eyes wandered along the neat rows of sun chairs, my nose travelled to the long summer evenings of my childhood, that smelled of sweet popcorn and cotton candy.
I had never been to an outdoor cinema before, so when my friend suggested we go, I jumped at the opportunity. Now, standing here, I was glad I did.
The re-run was the 1999 teen comedy, “10 Things I Hate About You”. A classic “chick-flick” which I have admittedly watched several times before. It’s a light-hearted love story that ends well, and gives you the right amount of 90’s nostalgia.
Before you go off questioning my taste in movies, I didn’t decide to spend 10 euros on this particular occasion for the sake of the film in question. I spent the 10 euros for the experience.
And an experience it was.
From the moment we stepped into the soft afternoon glow of Graça, I was already in my own outdoor movie. Like a dream within a dream.

Discussing Azure, blockchains and… machine learning rap
This past week was quite eventful for me. I attended the school-symposium DATA Science 2018 — in (Astro)Particle Physics and the Bridge to Industry (about which which I’ll have a post soon) during the whole week, but on Wednesday I went to Microsoft’s headquarters in Lisbon for the 5th PyData Lisbon Meetup | Special Edition.
It’s impressive that the PyData Lisbon community has already more than 500 members as there had only been four events beforehand (the first one in last September). The fifth meetup had 200 participants (the maximum that the Microsoft’s auditorium would allow) and for a good reason: the YouTube phenomenon Siraj Raval was in the house!
But before we met Siraj Raval, there was the talk “We ran out of memory” by Silvio Rodrigues and Tim Kock, two of the founders of Jungle AI, a young startup specialized in predictive intelligence. It dealt with machine learning at scale, using the Azure cloud platform by Microsoft to solve problems which cannot be handled by a laptop.
As a beginner in these things, it was fascinating to me to see such large scale machine learning being used in real-world situations. Even though I wasn’t able to follow every single detail, the informality and joviality of Tim Kock kept me engaged in the presentation.
After a small break for some pizza and beer (thanks Microsoft!), it was time to listen to Siraj Raval, with his presentation “AI Networks”, which you can find in his GitHub. He mostly discussed the next phase of the Web, “Web 3.0”, focusing on blockchain technology and decentralized applications.
I’ve only come across Siraj’s YouTube channel a few months ago while I was searching for videos about machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I was very surprised by the enormous number of subscribers. Who knew so many people would watch videos discussing machine learning algorithms and frameworks?
And apparently some of his early videos had him rapping about these concepts! I hadn’t watched any of them, but Siraj was kind enough to showcase his abilities during the Q&A. I confess that that was not what I was expecting to see when I went to this meetup.
Overall, it was an entertaining evening . If you’d like to check, the event was live streamed on Facebook — and, yes, it includes the rap at the end.

In Lisbon, the soul of the city is written in azulejos. These hand-painted ceramic tiles cover the facades of its oldest buildings, shimmering in sunlight and rain alike, whispering the stories of the city’s past. But walk through Lisbon today, and you’ll notice gaps where tiles once clung — empty spaces on walls like missing teeth in a smile. Construction sites pile broken tiles alongside debris, while sleek new developments encroach on neighborhoods that once hummed with history. It’s here, amid the rubble of modernity, that Serra Behar steps in.
Serra, an artist and a neighbor, isn’t just creating art; she’s waging a quiet, poignant battle to preserve Lisbon’s identity. Her exhibition, Autoimmunity and Allergy, now showing at MAD Gallery, speaks to the fragility of the azulejo, but more importantly, to the fragility of the systems and memories they represent. Each azulejo Serra collects — chipped, cracked, or discarded — is a piece of Lisbon’s story that she refuses to let fade away.
The Artist as Caretaker
For Serra, saving azulejos is an act of care. “Each tile I pick up feels like rescuing a fragment of the city’s memory,” she tells me, her tone both determined and wistful. Her work begins on the streets, where she searches construction sites and demolition zones for tiles that have been cast aside. These aren’t perfect tiles — they’re worn, their colors dulled by time, their edges chipped. But that’s precisely why Serra finds them beautiful.
“They’ve lived,” she says simply. And now, they live again through her art.
At MAD Gallery, her rescued tiles are arranged in installations that feel both meticulous and tender. The rawness of the broken tiles contrasts with the clean gallery space, making the viewer hyperaware of their imperfections. “They’re not supposed to be perfect,” Serra explains. “They’re supposed to remind us of what’s been lost — and what’s worth saving.”
Saving Lisbon, One Tile at a Time
Lisbon, like many cities, is caught in a paradox. Its history is its greatest asset, but its future is being built at the expense of that history. Serra’s work grapples with this tension. Through her art, she shows how azulejos — these seemingly small, decorative objects — are, in fact, vital to the city’s identity.
The azulejo is more than an aesthetic flourish; it’s a language. Its patterns and colors speak of Portugal’s Moorish past, its maritime adventures, its religious traditions, and its modernist movements. But when these tiles are removed, the city loses a piece of its voice. The smooth, glassy surfaces of new construction might glimmer, but they are mute.
Serra’s mission is to give those missing tiles a voice again. By presenting them as art, she forces us to see them not as relics but as witnesses. Each crack and chip becomes a story: of the artisan who painted it, the wall it adorned, and the generations who passed by it on their way to somewhere else.
The Skin of the City
Serra’s exhibition title, Autoimmunity and Allergy, is not a metaphor she chose lightly. She compares the removal of azulejos to a skin condition, where the protective outer layer is damaged, leaving what lies beneath exposed and vulnerable. “Tiles are the skin of buildings,” she says. “They protect the structure, but they also define its character. When you strip them away, you expose scars — not just physical scars, but cultural ones.”
Her metaphor extends further. Just as the body can attack itself in autoimmune diseases, cities, too, can turn on themselves. In the rush to modernize, Lisbon has unwittingly destroyed parts of itself, sacrificing its unique character for the sake of progress. Serra’s work asks a pressing question: Can we find a way to modernize without erasing? Can Lisbon save itself from itself?
A Quiet Resistance
There is a quiet, almost subversive quality to Serra’s art. She isn’t staging protests or writing manifestos. Instead, she’s walking the streets of her city, rescuing one azulejo at a time. Each piece she collects is a small act of defiance, a refusal to let history be discarded like construction waste.
At MAD Gallery, this resistance is palpable. The tiles are displayed not as ornaments but as artifacts. Serra has stripped them of their original context, forcing the viewer to consider their fragility and their significance. Some are arranged to emphasize their broken edges, others are mounted to reveal the raw, unglazed sides that were never meant to be seen. It’s as if the tiles themselves are saying, “Look at me. Remember me.”
The Power of One
In a city as vast and complex as Lisbon, the idea of saving it one azulejo at a time might seem quixotic. But Serra believes in the power of small, deliberate acts. “You don’t save a city all at once,” she says. “You save it piece by piece, memory by memory, tile by tile.”
Her work resonates not because it offers grand solutions but because it reminds us of the importance of paying attention. It’s easy to overlook the cracks in a facade or the gap where a tile used to be. But Serra’s art asks us to slow down, to notice, and to care.
An Invitation to See
As I left MAD Gallery, I found myself looking at Lisbon differently. I noticed the patterns on the azulejos of buildings I’d passed a hundred times without a second thought. I noticed where tiles were missing and where new ones had been added in their place. I noticed, too, the scaffolding that seemed to creep further into the city with every passing month.
Serra’s work had done what all great art should: it had changed the way I saw the world. And it had given me a simple but profound reminder — that saving a city isn’t just the work of governments or preservation societies. It’s the work of individuals, of neighbors like Serra, who care enough to save a single azulejo from being forgotten.
For those who haven’t yet visited Autoimmunity and Allergy, I urge you to go. And when you do, take a moment to reflect on the azulejos you see — or don’t see — on your way there. Each one is a fragment of Lisbon’s story, waiting to be noticed, remembered, and, perhaps, saved.

Ah, November in Lisbon, Portugal — what an exciting time!
Now, I’m not just talking about those amazing sunsets, the delicious food, or the stunning buildings and hidden gems scattered around the city.
No, I’m here for something special: the Web Summit.
This massive tech conference is one of the biggest in the world.
It’s a place where you get to learn so much and meet all these amazing people from everywhere, all passionate about technology just like us.
While this year’s attendance wasn’t my first, it was, once again, an amazing experience.
When you attend a conference alongside 70,000+ people, your perspective changes.
Definitely, at one point I felt overwhelmed.
As I took in the surroundings, I considered the newcomers to this impressive conference and the questions likely swirling in their minds:
After pondering these questions, I decided to share a few words about my experience at the Web Summit in Lisbon and offer tips to help others feel more confident at similar events.
No one should leave such events with negative feelings about their participation or a sense of unproductivity. With some preparation, events like the Web Summit can unfold numerous opportunities.
I hope this article will guide you the next time you attend a large event, as it reflects what I wish I had known before going to my first major gathering.
Many Web Summit attendees are first-timers, and it’s crucial to acknowledge this. Beginners might feel overwhelmed in the fast-paced atmosphere and face common challenges of large events, making navigation seem daunting. With 70,000 participants, the event’s sheer size might lead some to dismiss it prematurely as not worthwhile.
However, I challenge that perspective. Events such as the Web Summit offer a phenomenal platform for learning and networking with influential folks from all over the world.
Still, first things first: your journey at Web Summits starts with your phone.
To maximize your benefit from the event, keep a few things in mind. First, make sure to download the event app, but be cautious about its potential drawbacks. While it provides maps, attendee lists, and other details, filtering people or presentations for specific niche topics of interest might be challenging.
Also, carefully consider how much you’ll rely on the app for networking because it is not primarily designed to facilitate engagement beyond the chat feature.
Consider in such an environment: how likely is it that those you message will respond?
Drawing from my personal experience: use the app for navigation, but avoid relying solely on it for engaging with people.
With numerous presentations occurring at the same time, it’s challenging to keep up with all of them. The venue is filled with ongoing presentations requiring constant movement.
In my view, the source matters more than the topic. A captivating title doesn’t guarantee the presenter’s relevance to the subject. I prefer finding relevant people and attending their presentations, regardless of the topic. Feel free to skip some sessions, as content is often repeated.
Consider your participation in the Web Summit as an investment. Approach it with curiosity and passion, asking questions and challenging ideas. Stay open to your peers’ ideas, as there are valuable learning opportunities. Strive to gain something from each presentation session, as this investment will yield dividends over time.
Friendly tip: Web Summit is packed with sessions, events, keynotes, and workshops. Prioritize the ones you can’t miss and plan your schedule accordingly.
And remember: no matter how hard you try, you’ll not be able to attend everything and be everywhere.
My next piece of advice is to schedule meetings in advance if possible.
This is the pre-event preparation phase I mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that first-time attendees may be eager to attend presentations and explore the venue, but meeting with the right people is crucial.
The people you meet at Web Summit could be your future partners, mentors, or investors.
You’ll only have one chance to make a fine first impression.
Friendly tip: At events like Web Summit, excellent opportunities often arise unexpectedly! Don’t hesitate to talk to unfamiliar faces and explore beyond your usual interests. You might uncover something surprising.
A key lesson from my experiences at Web Summit is the value of side events. They’re smaller, and more intimate, and people tend to prioritize building meaningful relationships. Also, make sure to have fun in the evenings. Many see Web Summit as a tech event that doubles as a big party, and there’s some truth to that.
The most valuable connections often happen when people are at ease.
Trust me on this one: feel free to miss a scheduled session for a lively discussion or a significant announcement happening elsewhere. Stay flexible, trust your instincts, and take advantage of chances to talk whenever they come up. Whether it’s a coffee break or waiting for a keynote speech, these unplanned interactions can lead to valuable new contacts.
Web Summit offers unique opportunities to network with individuals you might not have met elsewhere, such as an entrepreneur from Brazil, an investor from Costa Rica, or a remarkable founder from Japan.
Friendly tip: Don’t just focus on sales at Web Summit. Meet people, have engaging questions ready, and show genuine interest in their stories.
Remember Dale Carnegie’s advice: to be interesting, be interested.
If you have a goal for attending the Web Summit, make sure to plan accordingly.
For instance, if your goal is to generate leads or secure funding, take the time to prepare your pitch and craft effective conversation starters.
Also, decide where to focus your time to connect with the right people.
Your goal should determine your tactics.
Copying what everyone else is doing won’t lead to exceptional results.
Friendly tip: Bring plenty of business cards and prepare a concise elevator pitch about yourself and your business/interests. Nobody will dedicate an hour to intros, as time is a precious asset at the Web Summit — use it wisely.
My personal favorite spots:
Stepping into the vibrant world of events such as the Web Summit, it’s crucial to remember that balance is key. If you’ve reached this point, one thing is clear:
There is a lot to think about.
While the conference offers an ocean of opportunities, your success will rely on your ability to prepare and engage purposefully. Simultaneously, stay open to spontaneous connections and seize opportunities on the spot.
You know why you’re attending.
You’re there for a reason.
Keep an open mind and stay curious — a seasoned conference-goer knows it’s the unplanned conversations and unexpected learning opportunities that often create remarkable insights.
Most importantly, enjoy the process. Embrace the grandness of everything, the dynamics, as well as the rollercoaster of ideas and conversations.
After all, the true essence of large-scale events lies in the vast opportunities right in front of you.
Hope to see you next year in Lisbon!

Somewhere new for us to visit. I had been trying to find a location which would hopefully be warm in April and which neither of us had been to before, and being practical, somewhere which was a direct flight away from Gatwick. I was surprised by just how many places that ruled out. And how many places in Spain and Italy are code shared by BA ad require a change of plane along the way.
So I came up with Lisbon. Lots of variables around the dates, leave years, other events we were going to, and so on. So much so the fact that we were going during the week before Easter and all the kids would be off school passed me by completely.
It was a nice, civilised time for the easyJet flight from Gatwick to Lisbon, relatively painless apart from the ten-minute bus journey from the plane in the middle of a field somewhere to the terminal building. The Lisbon metro from the airport was straightforward. And the art in the stations was fascinating, if only I hadn’t got the camera buried away in my bag.
We popped out of the metro station, and it was two minutes to the hotel. For a change it isn’t an IHG one, as they were either in remote locations, or ridiculously expensive and had no points nights available for the four nights we were going to be here. So it is a random Booking.com hotel. Which looks decent enough in the lobby, but they are doing improvements on it. With it being a Booking.com choice we are in a before room. Which very much has an eighties Marbella vibe about it. But it is clean and has a comfy bed and its not like we’ll be spending much time outside of sleeping in it anyway. We’re going to be too busy being out exploring. Which after dumping the bags we were. It was a literal dump and run, no unpacking.
A bit of late lunch and we are off wandering down the city’s main boulevard heading towards the river. There is a market down one side of the boulevard, which we aren’t going to be distracted by, it isn’t a shopping trip. Besides aiming for the river there is no plan.
But as any regular reader will know we are easily distracted and tend to detour off at the slightest whim. There is no master plan for the trip as neither of us had looked at the guidebooks until we were on the plane. Though we have booked the standard hop on hop off bus tickets. As when don’t we?
The detouring didn’t take long to kick in as we saw a funicular off down a side street just a short walk from the main boulevard, and we headed over there for a ride up the side of the hill.
Lisbon is remarkably hilly, and most of them are steep. On the metro journey into the centre there were a couple of times where we popped out from being underground and suddenly found ourselves on a bridge over a valley before popping back into another tunnel.
Anyway, at the top of this funicular run is a short walk to gardens with views out over a lot of the city.
Next to the top of the funicular track is a building with an interesting tower and a spiral staircase up to the top. From which the views would be even better (even if it would be no good for my vertigo), but there is no public entrance to it. So we go back down and rejoin the main drag to get to the river.
A lot of the city was destroyed by a major earthquake in 1755, so most of the lower part of the city leading to the river was rebuilt in the late eighteenth century in a grid pattern, following what they had seen in Paris. They have managed to shoehorn some modern monstrosities in as they do everywhere, but there are some splendid examples of early twentieth century Art Deco buildings plugged into gaps as well.
They quite like a square here. There are some vast open paved spaces which we pass through on the way to the river.
And they certainly like a big old statue. A lot of the time it is a figure high up in the air at the top of a tall column, or as I got to be calling them as the trip went on, ‘another bloke on a stick.’
Anywhere they have a square, or a wide pavement, then they have cafes and restaurants spilling out into them. We are not going to struggle to find somewhere to eat on this trip.
Along one such alfresco dining mecca on a pedestrianised street we can see the grand archway becoming larger with each footstep.
Once through it, would you believe it, we are in another huge square. With a fountain in the middle (they do love a fountain, although not many of them have the water running), and on the other side of the square is the River.
It is the River Tagus (which I’m sure sees lots of people doing a tag us in post on social media), or as they call it in Lisbon the Tejo. At this point it is more like an inland bay. The channel which heads out west from here is wide enough, the massive suspension bridge shows that, but here it is more like being at the coast with it being the sea between you and another country. But it isn’t, that is still Portugal out over the other side of the expanse.
The sun is shining, it is a leisurely late Sunday afternoon and so we stroll along the banks of the river following the sun in going to the west, looking for somewhere to get refreshment. There are stalls along the front. The trend would very much appear to be to pina coladas served in hollowed out pineapples. A bar has a DJ playing next to the water, and in yet another square there is a live band playing traditional Portuguese music.
We find a café on the waterfront near the ferry port (for crossing the inland bay to the cities on the south of the river) in the sun and have drinks. The coffee looks amazing and tasted even better.
It is relaxing watching the people and the variety of boats going by.
We like it so much we stop there to have food. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a menu where one of the dishes have proclaimed themselves as being spiritual, but there on the menu is Spiritual Cod, which Helen ended up ordering.
It didn’t come with enlightenment or a prayer book, just in a dish looking like it was Cod Mornay.
Whilst sat outside the restaurant, another couple on the end table tried to spirit themselves away without paying, but the eagle-eyed staff noticed and ran after them, card machine in hand and got them to cough up what they had tried to avoid paying.
The sun is all but gone by the time we move on. We find we are close to the Time Out Market, so we have a wander through it to have a look. It is full and buzzy with lots of food options and certainly somewhere to think about coming back to on another evening.
We are now heading in the vague direction of the hotel. There are more squares. Buildings are being lit up. There are lots of interesting vehicles trying to entice tourists in for tours. And there are more steep uphill roads to walk up. That is the thing with guidebook maps. They show the roads and the direction they go in, but there is no mention or indication of the elevation of said roads.
After going up for what seems like a long time, we find ourselves at the top of the route of a different funicular. A quick check shows it goes down to the main drag we have walked along from the hotel earlier in the day, so we hop on.
We did know we had been going uphill for quite some time since leaving the banks of the river, but it is a surprise just how far we had climbed as the funicular ride down took a lot longer than we had imagined it would, and than the earlier one had.
When we had been going in the opposite direction earlier, the side of the road we walk along now had been full of market stalls, but they have all packed up and gone, only to leave behind the occasional café or restaurant which had been disguised by the surrounding stalls earlier.
There are lots of billboards up around the city as there had been when we were in Budapest, as there are elections on the way. I know it isn’t the correct interpretation, but I’m not sure I would be voting for someone with a slogan of Zero Future.
What had been intended to be a quick mooch about became six hours. Six very enjoyable hours, but now bed, and rest is calling us as there will be a lot more hours, so much more to see, and difficult food choices to be made for the next four days to come.

Of course, Hybrid Work is not only a campaign to us. Therefore, we want to introduce you to our colleagues that work from everywhere as digital nomads for diconium. Read further to see how Verena experienced her workation in beautiful Lisbon.
“Oh, you worked from Lisbon?” That was a common response to my explanation that I didn’t take a six-month sabbatical in Portugal, but simply moved the home office to the sun.
But back to the beginning: in October 2021, I took my first workation. Two weeks in Portugal — first Lisbon, then Porto — together with my colleague Lena. And that’s when a thought came up: Why not just stay longer? No sooner said than done. At the end of February 2022, it was time: I said goodbye to Stuttgart and boarded a plane heading south. Looking forward to warm spring days, lots of sun and much better weather than in Germany. Nice dream. It may sound surprising, but it also rains in Lisbon. A lot. Until April. But hey, somehow it was still nice to spend this “April weather” somewhere else.
Do you want to become a colleague of Verena at diconium? Take a look at our open positions! 💜🚀 Strategy Consulting / All vacancies
Why Lisbon, you might ask yourselves? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city where you can find everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses, a thriving nightlife, the most beautiful beaches within reach, good restaurants and cafes, relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life. Oh yes, of course we also have an office there. Little has changed in my day-to-day work. The same projects, the same colleagues, even before mostly remote — now I just had to get up an hour earlier. But it still felt easier.
“Why Lisbon, actually? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city that has everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses…relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life.”
The positive attitude towards life and the joy that this city carries also has a positive effect on my work. I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days. Lisbon simply invites you to leave the house also later in the evening, because there is so much to discover and see. And bang — it’s the weekend again. And in good Portuguese style, you simply enjoy it on the beach. You don’t need a vacation for that, it’s just a normal Saturday. Crazy, isn’t it?
“I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days.”
But I want to share something else: The biggest learning for me was how much I miss the physical meetings with my colleagues (even though I can’t count on one hand how many of them made a trip to Lisbon during my stay). Especially after things became a bit more open and dynamic again after two years remote work, I felt like I was stuck in the pandemic for even longer in my daily work life in Lisbon. Although I visited the Lisbon office, I did not meet my colleagues I’m directly working with. Therefore, every visit I made to our offices in Germany during this time showed me again how valuable these face to face interactions are — both on a human level and for the project progress. Just locking yourself and your team in a room for half a day helps move the project forward. And honestly? As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues again regularly.
“As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues regularly.”
Don’t get me wrong, there’s something about sitting in a café on the beach and working from there — provided the internet connection is stable and the noise level is kept in check. Big shoutout to Teams for providing virtual backgrounds! That’s why I’m already very excited about where I’ll be going next and for how long. Because there is no doubt that I’ll be on another Workation. But in the end it is always nice to come back home.

In my previous article for Live View, I discussed the cameras I decided to bring along on a trip my wife and I planned for six months or more. The trip would start from Lisbon, voyage briefly to Tangiers, and then cruise along the coast of Andalusia to Barcelona. I wanted to travel light but be prepared to do justice to the places I would be seeing for the first, and possibly only, time.
Now we are in the midst of that trip. This article is a report on how things have worked out so far for me and my photography, as illustrated by what I saw in Lisbon.
To recap, I brought two cameras, my OM Systems OM-1 and my new Fuji X100VI. For the OM-1, I took two lenses — the 12–100mm F/4 and the 8–25mm F/4. At the last minute, I decided to take my 18mm conversion lens for the X100VI, and I’m glad I did. I originally thought that the OM-1 would be fine for all focal lengths, but it turns out that the X100VI with the wide conversion lens is great for small city streets.
Which I used more. On various tours over three days, including dark interiors and bright streets, I used whichever camera seemed appropriate — I carried both. Counting the results, it turns out I used both cameras equally. Six hundred thirty images with the Fuji, 680 for the OM.
When it came to focal lengths, it turns out I used the Fuji with the wide converter 56% of the time —…

Going down for breakfast we were able to get what looked to be the last two free seats in the restaurant. I’m looking down the room thinking it is rammed and being surprised as it wouldn’t appear the hotel is that big. But there is a mirror across the back of the room, so it looks twice the size with twice the people in it, and it was only my third wander around the room before I nearly walked into myself coming the other way and realised what was going on. (Have I said I’m not a morning person?)
I suppose it could be said I’m the weather jinx. The previous afternoon had been warm, so this morning I leave the hotel in shorts, t-shirt, and wearing sunglasses. So of course by the time we got on the first of the tour buses it was overcast and threatening to rain. If I said it was a little changeable during the day it might just about cover the number of times we changed seats, got undercover, back into the open, back undercover, in the open, downstairs, upstairs, downstairs, on and off.
When the sun did break through it was lovely and warm, but on the second of the three bus tour routes the spit spots turned into a torrential downpour, which coincided with exactly where we had planned to get off the bus and explore on foot.
As with many larger cities there are more than one route of HOHO buses in Lisbon. There are lots of places of interest to see, but they are spread out over a wide area, putting them all on one route would mean an exceedingly long bus tour.
We had decided on the blue route first which was more to the east and north of the city. Besides the grand municipal buildings and old churches it is interesting as to what catches the eye when on the tours. Such as the sex shop in a building with an Art Deco female fresco on the wall.
Or the Lisbon Business Centre being in a low rent run down block with ideas above its station.
The name of an ice cream store.
Or even the former gas storage frames.
The route goes through the part of the city which had regeneration for when Lisbon hosted Expo 1998. And there are some very interesting structures to see.
There is always too much to try and take in and with the speed of travel, or the angle you are at on the bus means that I spend a lot of time when back at home wondering what the hell I was trying to take a photo of.
What is not in any doubt is just how steeply undulating the city is. There are a lot of roads the buses go up which I’d not want to attempt driving a car, especially the angle of some of the red light induced hill starts which would be needed.
After a lap of the blue route, we change to the red route, getting part of the way around before the rain forced us downstairs for cover, fortunately picking seats which weren’t still getting leaked on down there. The viewpoint behind raindrop splattered windows is totally different and the opportunity to take photographs is limited. To zero.
We got off where we had planned to at the Jeronimos Monastery, supposedly where the first Pastel de Natas were ever made. It is in a traffic free zone (apart from the tour buses), and it is surrounded by museums. (And parts of the monastery buildings have been converted into museums.)
It is properly tipping it down and so we head into a packed Maritime Museum café for lunch. There are map related items to buy in the gift shop, without having to go into the museum, so always good. And whilst we had been lunching the rain had stopped and the sun was trying to escape the cloud cover.
Only for the rain to come back the moment we step outside. But we are used to rain, and we carry on and have a mooch about, through gardens, under the road and railway and to the riverbank and the immense Monument to the Discoveries on it.
In front of it in the square is a map of the world and on it are places highlighted with dates of when the Portuguese empire arrived there during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries following the footsteps of its famed explorers Vasco de Gama and Ferdinand Magellan.
We are heading back under the road and rail when Helen feels someone close up behind her. There is a woman pawing at her backpack and saying, ‘sorry it was open.’ It most definitely wasn’t the woman was blatantly trying to rob Helen. Fortunately, the front pocket was only full of tissues, and her phone and purse were at the bottom of the main compartment buried under lots of other stuff like a jumper and scarf. But whilst checking there was nothing missing the woman and her sidekick had scuttled off as fast as they could and were nowhere to be seen when we were back up at street level. The would-be thief may have got fuck all, but it did shake Helen up and meant she was reluctant to use the backpack as a backpack for the rest of the day and was ultra wary about anyone being close behind her at all.
It began to brighten as we continued to wander around Belem, but we didn’t stop and pick the bus back up at the same point, instead we ended up walking back towards the large suspension bridge.
This meant a detour over a footbridge spanning the road and railway and out onto the roof of one of the MAAT buildings, giving a good view of the other older one.
And of the suspension bridge, built to look like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, it is painted in the same plum colour paint (which is the best colour to be seen in the fog), but is a bit shorter.
Behind it on the hill on the south of the river is the statue Christ the King, like a smaller version of Christ the Redeemer in Rio, more like Christ the Reduced. They do like a copy.
The bridge is called the April 25th Bridge, a nod to the 1974 revolution. It had been shrouded in mist when we had come past it on the bus earlier.
We walked back to under the bridge before reacquainting ourselves with the HOHO bus tours, retracing part of the route we had done before (downstairs in the dry at the time), and past the Belem tower.
Another shower forced us back undercover, and moving back out from the cover just happened to coincide with passing the Basilica, one of the more spectacular churches of the city, and I missed the chance to get a photo of it completely.
Before the loop was complete, we jumped off to change to the green route for a couple of stops to get us up the steep narrow winding streets to the castle. It is easy to see why this route uses a minibus. The route certainly makes me want to reiterate my reluctance to ever want to drive on these streets in a car.
The plan is to get to the castle so that we can catch the 5pm walking tour included with the HOHO tickets. Which we just about manage.
The tour guide in Guilherme, and he is from Brazil, and is doing the tour in English and Spanish, which just blows my mind as I can only just about manage the one language, and even that needs to be carried around in a bucket most of the time.
From the high point next to the castle entrance we have a slow meander down to the river stopping at key points to have things pointed out and for little pieces of the history of the city imparted to us.
One is at the statue of St Vincent (patron saint of the city),
And the viewpoint down from the plaza there, over the terracotta roofs to the river, and across to the church of St Vincent on another hill,
And the dome of the National Pantheon housed in a former church.
We pass a tree which looks like it roots have escaped from the soil and are on an acid trip induced adventure.
There is a quick poke inside the cathedral (which we are likely to return to later in the week).
And then it is down to the river side, stopping at the spiky house.
And finally into the Commerce Square in front of the grand arch, which we had passed through on our little stroll the evening before.
It was a good tour, lasting a lot longer than the advertised hour, and there was even a recommendation of a post tour restaurant for dinner. Which had massive portions of lovely food at reasonable prices. Such sized portions it was probably a good idea there was a walk back up to the hotel involved afterwards.
Those twelve hours had flown by. Time for rest and to get ready to do it all again tomorrow. More buses and a boat tour to come.

There are few things more iconic than leaving rainy London in search of sunnier skies — only to land in Portugal to find… more rain.
Welcome to Lisbon, land of seven hills, centuries of charm, and one of the soggiest weekends I’ve ever had. And somehow, it was still magical.
We arrived bright-eyed, hopeful, and wildly underdressed. The UK, of course, had decided to be 22°C and sunny that weekend, while Lisbon greeted us with a torrential downpour.
After squelching to our hotel, Portobay Liberdade, we regrouped and, now lightly towel-dried, swam our way to a nearby Italian spot (Il Basilico, I think?) for a bite. My travel companion’s trainers were instantly soaked, turning a casual stroll into a mission: Operation Waterproof Shoe Hunt.
Easier said than done. Lisbon’s got many things — views, wine, vintage tiles, but trainers shops? Not in a monsoon.
That first day? Honestly, a washout. But then, we stumbled into dinner. And let me tell you, it was a revelation.
After drying off from our soggy adventures, we chose to dine in our hotel that night at Bistro 6, and it was one of the most fantastic choices we made. The duck was remarkable: Crispy on the outside, tender and rich on the inside, with a wonderful depth of flavour present in every bite. It was so good that even in a city as full of culinary gems as Lisbon, we couldn’t resist going back for round two. I’m pretty sure I’ll be daydreaming about that plate for years to come.
By morning, we gave in to our fate. Lisbon was going to soak us, and we were going to like it. Jackets on, umbrellas up (luckily supplied by the hotel), optimism renewed.
First stop: the Mercado da Ribeira (aka Time Out Market Lisbon). Our first-ever Time Out Market and it set the bar high. It wasn’t your typical chaotic food court, instead, it felt like a well-curated space with an incredible variety of options. From fresh seafood and gourmet croquettes to decadent handmade chocolates, there was something for every craving. The place was organised yet vibrant, buzzing with energy.
If you’re new in town, it’s the perfect place to meet people: everyone sits together, it’s lively, communal, and thriving.
We grabbed a doughnut (incredible!!), a couple of coffees, then wandered through the traditional market tucked behind the main hall. Fishmongers shouting, locals shopping, fruit stacked high, there was a real sense of the city coming to life. We were completely captivated.
Next, we set off to see Lisbon Cathedral (Sé) and try our luck with Tram 28, Lisbon’s charmingly vintage and famously packed transit option. While we waited in the drizzle, we were approached by a charismatic Parisian tour guide, offering a covered tuk-tuk ride through the city.
Usually, we’d run from that kind of pitch, but he had a roof, plastic sides, and an irresistible charm. Reader, we climbed aboard.Best decision of the trip.
He took us through the seven hills of Lisbon, shared history with passion, pointed out hidden spots we’d never have found on our own, and gave us time to really enjoy the views, not just tick them off a list.
Oh, and at our very first miradouro (viewpoint), someone proposed right next to us. Cue tears. Lisbon, suddenly, wasn’t just rainy — it was romantic.
We ended the day at Praça do Comércio, where the weather finally gave us a break. Picture this: three grand golden-yellow façades on three sides…and then, nothing. Just open sky and the wide, rolling Tagus River, looking more like a calm ocean than a river. It was one of the most unexpectedly stunning squares I’ve ever stood in.
With a glass of wine in hand and the wind finally drying our coats, we toasted to Lisbon’s stubborn beauty.
Sunday morning brought us to Belém — land of custard tarts and monumental queues. Our attempt to visit Jerónimos Monastery failed (read: misunderstood the queue and were politely turned away), but fate had better plans: we headed early to Pastéis de Belém instead.And thank everything holy we did.
This place is a Lisbon legend. From the outside, it looks like a pleasant café. But inside? It’s a labyrinth of awning-covered rooms, waiters by the dozen, and pastries by the thousands. Somehow, we snagged a table.
Between the two of us, we ordered at least six pastries — custards, almond cakes, an orange thing I can’t explain — and two coffees. The bill? €10 total. I don’t know how. I don’t care. I would’ve paid triple.
We even brought some back to the UK with us. That’s how good they were.
We wandered through Alfama and Old Town Lisbon on our last day, taking in the steep streets, the tiled walls, the laundry flapping above us. If I can give you one travel tip for Lisbon, it’s this:
Do not come with a new hip. Or bad knees. Or any aversion to steep climbs.Lisbon is beautifully vertical. Like, mountain goat vertical. My poor mum (fresh from hip surgery) was a trooper, but fair warning: this city is cardio with a capital C.
So, was it the sun-soaked European weekend I imagined? No.Was it a glorious, rain-drenched, pastry-fueled, unexpectedly beguiling adventure? Absolutely.
Lisbon is a city that sneaks up on you. It’s tiled facades and rooftop views, ghost stories in ancient cathedrals, and secret tarts tucked in glass counters. It’s fascinating markets and quiet moments, and unexpected friendships with French tuk-tuk drivers.
It’s a city I’ll absolutely come back to, preferably with better footwear, a lighter raincoat, and the same appetite for surprises.

I love reading fiction, writing when the mood strikes, and pottering outside when the sun comes out. Love art, travel, and catching a West End show when I can.

With the sun beating down on me and a temperature of over 28°C, I see a fellow runner lying on the curb being attended to by first responders. I check my watch and decide to stop once again at the next water station. This is going to be much tougher than I expected…
My journey to the 2017 Lisbon Marathon started in the winter of 2015. I was busy assembling IKEA furniture when I was struck by a burning pain in my knee that refused to go away. For the next few days it continued to get worse and every small stair suddenly became a major challenge. Finally, I decided to see an orthopedist. I never really liked (or had much reason) to see a doctor, but I had just turned 45, my girlfriend Anna was pregnant with our daughter and I figured getting it checked out would be the responsible thing to do.
The visit ended with a referral for an MRI that led to a nasty surprise. The cartilage in my knees was considerably damaged. These injuries had been looming for some time as I continued to ignore the warning signs. The diagnosis was clear. I would now be required to get a sodium hyaluronate injection directly into my knee joints every 6 months just to ease the pain. An injection with a price tag of $750 that isn’t covered by any health insurance. To add insult to injury, the doctor casually said, “Look, you may be able to go for a 5-kilometer jog, and you should do that regularly, but nothing longer. Take it easy, you will never be able to run a marathon, so don’t bother trying.” These comments resonated in me for a long time. I never even considered running a marathon — until this very moment.
I have always seen myself as a member of the running community, but frankly, my laps through the park had become less frequent over the years. There was the occasional spring onset of daily runs that lasted for about a month, but they were never farther than 5 to 10k. The longest distance I had ever run was a 25k race but that was only once and it was over 20 years ago. So, I could have been content with injections twice a year and back to a rather normal life. Only that I wasn’t.
The most urgent issue I wanted to focus on was the pain. I started reading a lot about treatment options and I decided to try something other than getting needles jammed into my knees. After a bit of experimentation, I found that taking a high dose daily (2000 mg) of glucosamine sulphate was starting to help me. Later, I added omega 3 and collagen to the mix. After a couple of weeks the burning sensation went away. I had indeed found an alternative for my battered knees.
Please bear with me, in one of my former lives I was also a lawyer: This is what worked for me, but no medical advice whatsoever is intended.
The following year I wasn’t really prioritizing my running career. Throughout all of 2016, I covered a total distance of less than 60 km in twelve runs. Yes, I had a lot of other things on my plate, with a newborn baby, being CEO of Berlin’s Innovation Agency and everything else. At least I was sticking to the doctor’s advice when it came to the part of “taking things easy” with my knees. But I had a growing sense that I was missing something. I was somehow able to manage getting everything done — but I was also realizing that I was losing my edge.
New Year’s Eve is always a great time for resolutions. In the years past, I must admit (and you can probably relate), these intentions were rather short-lived. But this time I was hell-bent to make a change for real. So I came up with something that seemed utterly beyond reach: For 2017 I resolved to run a marathon. And to make things more interesting, I didn’t even consider the Berlin Marathon in my hometown. I was looking for a venue with added value. I soon found Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, located at the River Tagus and the Atlantic Ocean, one of the most fascinating cities in Europe. With the race scheduled for October 15th, this would leave me enough time to find out if my knees would keep up with my ambitions.
The first thing I did was to read about marathon training. There are many manuals and programs out there. The takeaway lesson was: Run frequently, consistently including workouts for speed, stamina, and mobility and run a reasonable number of longer runs that should include a 30+ km run in the weeks before the event. This means you must spend a lot of time and you must spend it regularly. Marathon training is an exercise in discipline and commitment, that much I realized. Wait, I only had time for two handfuls of recreational runs in 2016 and (what I thought to be) insufficient sleep due to our baby’s somewhat erratic sleep patterns, a demanding job and, last but not least, a relationship to cherish. Sounds like something straight from the playbook of Mission Impossible, doesn’t it?
Nevertheless, I came up with a plan. I set 2 milestones that would serve as my intermediate goals: The 10k City Night race in Berlin on July 29th along the famous Kurfürstendamm Boulevard and the Stadtlauf Berlin half marathon on August 20th. If I could complete both within a reasonable time and my knees would be functional afterwards I would book the flights to Lisbon. After registering for both races, I started running 5 kilometers on January 3rd along the icy shores of Schlachtensee Lake, which would become my favorite route for the next couple of months.
With the marathon still in the “distant” future, the winter runs that followed were a bit sporadic. Eventually I had to figure out how to fit my training into my daily routine and the only solution I came up with was to get up early. And I mean really early, at 4:30 am.
There has been a lot written about the benefits of starting your day off early and I must say, it’s totally true! Starting your work day after you have spent some time working out is great. Having a daily sense of achievement after logging 10 or 20 km before you start breakfast is truly awesome. Having the chance to focus on your thoughts while enjoying the sunrise is priceless. So, over the next few months, I was running regularly and enjoying the slow and steady progress I was making.
Both tests I recklessly scheduled quite close to the big day went well, so I booked the flights and a very nice apartment in Lisbon’s historic Alfama district. Finally, it was going to happen. I would run at the Lisbon Marathon!
In the final week before the race one issue became increasingly pressing — the weather forecast. When I had the idea of flying to Portugal for my first ever marathon, I of course checked the weather information. On average you can expect 20°C in the middle of October. But not this year, the forecast was 31°C with clear skies. The 2006 Chicago Marathon had to be shut down with the mercury at 28°C but I expected that in sunny Portugal this wouldn’t even be considered. So, I frantically worked on adapting my gear. It is a good thing that you reduce your training miles leading up to the race (a.k.a. tapering), so you can take care of these kinds of things.
However, speaking of reduced miles, another question started nagging me. Did I train enough? Even though I ran nearly every day in the weeks prior to Lisbon, I never ran a distance longer than 25 km. But on the other hand, 15 km was one of my regular morning runs, so the additional stretch should be manageable, right? Since there was no chance I could redo my training plan in the next few days, I decided to relax. The race day would prove if my reasoning was right.
I arrived Thursday evening in Lisbon to acclimate myself and focus on the challenge ahead. It was a luxury to have time to think and I enjoyed doing so at the marathon’s designated finish at Praça do Comércio. Here, you have a wonderful view over River Tagus’ final passage before joining the Atlantic Ocean. It became my “vision quest” as my girlfriend Anna would call it. She has always been supportive of my aspirations. Although we originally planned to make the trip to Lisbon together, Anna decided to stay at home with our young daughter and this gave me the gift of time alone. I used it well and came up with a list of goals and dreams for my future.
Finally, the day of the race dawned and I was sitting on the train from Lisbon to Cascais jammed with marathoners in various degrees of contemplation. Some were sitting on the floor with an empty look on their face, others were chatting happily away with their running buddies or texting home. I was silently rehearsing my game plan: Stick to the well-trained pace of 5:30, don’t get carried away by competing with other runners in the first 20 or so km, pick up the pace at 30 km aiming at a negative split, finish sub 4:00 hours.
And I stuck to the plan, at least for the first 20 km. After crossing the starting line in a wave of euphoria I was soon running steadily. I found the waving flag of the 4 hour pacemaker I was going to follow until the half marathon mark and the first misting station was in sight.
Then something unexpected happened. The heart rate display on my watch jumped to an unreal 202 bpm and I forced myself to slow down. Around 175 bpm would have been the “normal” maximum for a person of my age. Today, looking back at the data, I’m sure that this reading was erroneous because I have never again gone over a 170 bpm. At the time, I only had the information on my display and it had a tremendous impact. I suddenly realized that I still had another half marathon to go and the sun was beating down mercilessly even though it wasn’t even 10 a.m. yet. I checked my knees for any signs of pain or weakness. Had I overestimated myself? How could I have believed that with only months of training I would be able to pull this off? I already envisioned myself collapsing at the roundabout near the beach of Carcavelos.
This was the point where I was (to be honest for the first time really) awestruck by the magnitude of the marathon as a test of body and mind. I considered my options. I could stop now and justify it with the parching heat and my staggering heart rate. But in the end, I decided to follow through, no matter what. My goal had changed. Certainly, I still wanted to finish with a time that would be to the best of my abilities, but I mainly focused on not being defeated. I would slow down, I would drink whenever possible, I would even walk any uphill stretches of the course. The reason I started this endeavor in the first place was to prove to myself that it was still possible to accomplish something really demanding and to push my limits. This would become my mantra for the next kilometers to come.
And those kilometers weren’t easy. In fact, I never experience the famous “runner’s high”, at least not while I was running. The last 10 km became an uncomfortable rhythm of moving along an agonizing 2.5 km stretch only to reach the next water station, drinking and cooling myself, and starting all over again, but it worked. After I had passed the 40 km mark the number of cheering spectators increased significantly. That gave me the final boost to give the backup goal I cooked up with while poking along the torrid Avenida Marginal a try: Finishing at 4:30.
With a final sprint I reached the finish line at 4:30:54!
After hitting the stop button on my sports watch I felt exhausted but otherwise amazingly good. No cramps, no sore muscles even in the days following the race. Interestingly enough, the knees that brought me there also carried me throughout the whole distance without any problems. So, on a physiological level, it is safe to say that the stress I put on my body was easily absorbed.
The marathon had both a short and long term impact on my psychology as well. It all started with the continuous effort I put into my training despite all the seemingly “good” reasons why there wasn’t enough time. Once I made up my mind and committed myself to the marathon, I magically found ways to make it happen. I was able to build up my knees by training and through supplements with no side effects based on the research I did. I was able to regain my confidence and mental strength on a very fundamental level. And I was able to apply all of this to master the challenge the Lisbon Marathon turned out to be.
After I had taken a cold shower in my apartment and devoured a carb-laden lunch, I immediately went back onto the streets of Lisbon for a walk. I noticed a shift in my perspective that is still present today. A lot of things suddenly felt shallow and dispensable, others became much more significant, like sharpening the focus of my mental map. And I started working towards reaching some of the most important goals that I had identified just days before.
So, it once again proves to be true: Every cloud has a silver lining. When I got the news of my supposedly ruined knees, it seemed to be the end of my running days. But instead, this was just the beginning! It has forced me to make decisions about how I want to live my life. I opted for the challenges and that has allowed me to grow beyond my athletic ambitions. You gain nothing by accepting your fate, you must keep on fighting if you want to win.

Lisbon is a city of seven hills. And I am the queen of one of them, for three days. But if I go down a hill, I must climb up again.
The charm of Lisbon is its narrow lanes and endless steps lined by colorful azulejos (tile) covered buildings. The beauty of Lisbon is its hills and plentiful viewpoints with panoramic views. To climb these hills, you’d need good food to fuel your stamina. The good news is, delicious food is everywhere for every budget.
Since we had been to Lisbon once many years ago, this time we decided not to cram a tourist checklist into our three-day stay.
We were first captivated by the sweeping view from Miradouro de Santa Catarina (Viewpoint of Saint Catarina), within a short walk from where we are staying. The grand Tagus River and the red tile roofs beneath glow in the warm sun, and Christ the King statue stands tall in the distance across the river. Both locals and tourists enjoy having a drink at Noobai rooftop bar and restaurant. We didn’t have a chance to catch the sunset there but it is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view. There is also…

When I was first thinking about moving to Germany, the appeal was pretty clear: Germany is an economic powerhouse, one of the strongest economies in the world. I thought to myself, “Okay, if I move there, I’m making a smart decision for my career.” And even though Berlin wasn’t exactly my first choice, I figured it would work as a starting point.
Fast forward six years, and I’m feeling stuck both personally and professionally and I’m starting to question the environment I’m in.
Feeling stuck? I wrote about why settling in one place can actually be dangerous for your growth. If you’re curious, check it out here: Why Settling in One Place Can Be Dangerous for Your Growth.
But, let’s get to the real reason I’m writing this post: Lisbon.
I recently visited Lisbon for the first time, and let me tell you, I was shocked in the best way possible, I was still taken aback by how much I loved it.
The streets were clean, the infrastructure was solid, and public transportation actually worked well enough to make getting around a breeze. But what really stood out to me was the overall vibe of the city. It just felt… ordered.
There was this balance of modernity and tradition, Lisbon had this richness that Berlin doesn’t always capture, at least not in the same way. It’s not just in the food and the gorgeous architecture, but in the way the city feels. The people were welcoming, the atmosphere felt peaceful and grounded — everything just felt a little… livable.
The streets didn’t feel unsafe or disorderly, and I didn’t have to dodge random bottles or step over anything unpleasant. It felt clean — and not just physically, but in terms of its overall atmosphere. Lisbon felt way more laid-back and balanced — a place where I could actually imagine calling home.
On my way back to Berlin I find myself wondering… could Lisbon be the place for me? Maybe it’s time to seriously think about it. But … As much as I’ve dreamt about moving to Lisbon, my hopes have taken a bit of a hit.
Lisbon used to have a reputation for being more affordable than other European capitals, but the reality is, rent prices have been climbing steadily — especially in the trendy neighborhoods — bringing them in line with cities like Berlin!
On top of that, salaries in Lisbon are still pretty low compared to other European cities, so the cost of living isn’t as balanced as I once thought. It’s a bummer, but looks like my dream of settling in Lisbon it didn’t last too long!
So here I am again, chasing the original plan moving to Munich. Although is one of the most expensive places to live in Germany, at least the salaries are around 30% higher than what I’ve been offered in Berlin!
But even with the potential for a bigger paycheck, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just stuck in this loop of chasing after cities that are becoming increasingly expensive while the job market still feels a bit of a mirage!
The whole “Germany has tons of job opportunities” narrative is, well, not exactly the truth. Anyone who’s actually lives here knows how tough it can be to land a job, even if you speak German at a C2 level. The competition is fierce, and sometimes it feels like it doesn’t matter how qualified you are.
Sure, the western and the southern part of Germany is still financially doing well, but if the job hunt keeps feeling this grim, it might just be time to explore other options. It’s a tough decision, but I’m honestly getting a little tired of hitting dead ends. I’m even starting to entertain the idea of leaving the country altogether.
Sadly, Lisbon will remain in my heart as a city that surprised me and gave me some amazing daydreams of a life where I could see smiles around and feel a sense of calm in the everyday. It’s the kind of place that makes you think, “This could be home,” but sometimes, reality just doesn’t align with those dreams.
I’m thinking about where to go next. I’ve got some exciting options on my mind, if you’re curious, check it out here: I’m Leaving Berlin. Let me know your thoughts!

Shannon is behind one of Lisbon’s coolest coding school: Le Wagon. We met at Beta-i and got curious to know more about her story and how you start such a project from scratch without being from the city yourself. Time for some questions!
I moved here four years ago to be with my boyfriend who is from Lisbon. I never imagined at that time that I would still be here four years on, but the city has been changing (for the good) at such an alarming rate in the last few years that I feel like I moved somewhere new.
Rather than why I came to live here, the better question is why I stayed. And to answer that, you can read a blog post I published a few weeks ago on Le Wagon — Why would you relocate to Lisbon?
www.lewagon.com
Le Wagon is a code school for non-technical entrepreneurs and creatives. We give people the programming and product development mindset through teaching ruby on rails web development.
My motivation to launch Le Wagon started two years ago while I was working in a local accelerator/ incubator here in Lisbon. I saw a lack of technical talent amongst the founders and also felt that I could benefit myself from understanding on a basic level what is going on behind the scenes of software.
Now, after having gone through the program myself and already running three 9 week batches in Lisbon, I can say I know that and a whole lot more, plus have 60+ Lisbon alumni as a support when it comes to launching my own products and finding cool jobs in the tech market.
Growing very quickly with a very diverse mix of internationals and locals.
We really wanted to be immersed in Lisbon’s startup ecosystem and Beta-i was a great way to access this community.
We could do a better job of this to be honest. At the moment, we are cross promoting events and of course enjoying some impromptu beers on the roof :)
Learning how to learn (again) — their EGOS! As humans, we are conditioned to shy away from challenge. We want all the glory with all the ease. We tend to work in areas and take on tasks that make us feel good. The first three weeks of Le Wagon are an ice cold shower for those that are not accustomed to just not getting something in the beginning. You really have to have faith in yourself and our curriculum when you start the program. The concepts are abstract for most people and they need to time sink in. Le Wagon is like learning to ride a bike. You have to be willing to keep getting on the bike and falling off and trust that eventually if you do that enough times, it will click and you’ll start riding.
To keep the students believing in themselves and their ability. To keep “falling off the bike”.
In our first batch, we had a student that really struggled. And when I say struggled, there were days he didn’t finish a challenge. But the guy had a great attitude. He didn’t give up. He didn’t compare himself to his classmates. He just kept going. After the bootcamp, he was one of the first to get a job and not even in ruby — in Javascript on the backend! He is our mascot here in Lisbon on what it means to give it your all.
Our community is growing locally. We expect in the next year to have our own space with our own cowering for our alumni and ruby on rails developers.
Thanks Shannon for your time and insights!

Here at Salsify, we can’t stop talking about our brand spankin’ new office and team in Lisbon, Portugal! We do love Boston, but nothing can top the beautiful sunny weather and gorgeous beaches of Lisbon. I recently got the chance to sit down with our People Operations Specialist in Portugal, Marta Carvalho, to get her take on Lisbon, Boston, and all things Salsify!
Q: So, what exactly does a People Operations Specialist do?
A: As a part of the People Ops team, it’s my responsibility to promote employee engagement and brand awareness, onboard new hires, support HR processes, team building, and a lot of other fun stuff! Since we are just getting started in Lisbon, my current work is very focused on building and growing the Lisbon team, and ramping up the Salsify employment brand in Lisbon.
Q: How long have you been working for Salsify?
A: A little over one month.
Q: How did you find out about Salsify?
A: I heard about Salsify coming to Lisbon through networking in the Lisbon tech community.
Q: What made you want to work for Salsify?
A: The opportunity to do what I really love in a company with great culture and values. It’s great to be part of this project since the beginning. Plus, I have the opportunity to be a pioneering person in HR and to think, implement, and see through the best policies and procedures!
Q: What is it like working for Salsify versus working for a Portuguese company?
A: For me, the possibility of traveling and working in collaboration with Boston colleagues on a daily basis is something that I really love. Plus, Portuguese companies tend to have long and inconclusive personal meetings! I’ve been struggling a lot with this in my last years :) I’m delighted that things at Salsify are done promptly, on time, and focus on specific goals. I feel that people here are very productive and efficient.
Q: What is the biggest cultural difference that you’ve encountered between Portugal and the United States?
A: Well . . . you all seem to have lunch and dinner pretty early :) I’m used to having dinner by 9 pm for instance while in Boston, it was super common to have dinner by 6 pm. It feels like days and nights in Portugal take longer.
Q: What has been your favorite and least favorite thing about working for Salsify so far?
A: Favorite thing is probably the possibility to work with such a great and friendly team. Least favorite thing is the current temporary office, which is about to change when we move to a new office full of windows and sunshine!
(We actually just moved to our new office! Check it out here.)
Q: Are you someone who can listen to music while you work?
A: Only during some tasks. If I’m doing some sourcing or replying to some emails, then yes. If I need to think about something more strategic or write down policies and procedures, I can’t.
Q: Where in the world would you most like to travel?
A: There are so many places I would like to go that it’s hard to pick out only one. I love sun and beaches, so anything that seems like a paradise are good destinations (Hawaii, Bahamas, Bali…).
Q: Do you have a hidden talent/fact that most people don’t know about you?
A: Well, I dance a lot of Salsa and Bachata. I’m not sure if it is a talent, but it’s something I love to do and I know how to do it.
Q: Tea or coffee?
A: Coffee for sure. Not a fan of tea, only drink it when I’m sick. Tea does not bring me good memories :)
Q: Reading or watching TV?
A: Both. Love to see a good movie or also to do some binge watching on Netflix. However, also love to take a book to Starbucks (yes, Starbucks is very appreciated in Lisbon!) or a nice coffee shop and read it on a rainy day.
Q: What is your favorite thing about Lisbon?
A: What keeps me in Lisbon is definitely being close to my family. Also, our sunny days, good food, and great sights to see make me love Lisbon. What I like the most is the possibility to go to the beach in fifteen minutes from my home! Even in winter, the sun stills shines here and you can have a good time on a nice terrace on the beach.
Q: Best lunch spot in Lisbon?
A: There are so many. Food in Lisbon is the best. I like to go to Portugalia, in Belem (but more because of the space rather than the food).Q: You recently visited the Boston office! Was this your first time in Boston? How did you like it?
A: Just loved it! It was my first time in the US and I was delighted. The first few days were pretty tough. Never felt so much cold in my entire life! But I loved to see the city with and without the snow. You have a beautiful city and compared to Lisbon, everything is so big. I felt very welcome by the whole team and got really impressed about how big we are in Boston. Looking forward to create something similar in Lisbon.
Q: What are you most excited about moving forward?
A: I love the creation processes of everything. So, very excited about creating the Lisbon Team and to set all things for the creation of our offices as well.
Obrigado, Marta, for letting us get to know you and Portugal a bit better! Check out our careers page for more info about all of our amazing job openings, and be sure to follow us on Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter for all the Salsify updates you could ever want.

Haven’t joined Medium yet but still want to read my story? Fine. Click Here
This was a museum that caught my eye when we did our ‘buzz through’ visit to Lisbon in February. Portugal has a centuries long maritime tradition for exploration, military and commercial enterprise and since world history is a subject I’m a little interested in, I put it on the list.
We came back to Lisbon near the end of March and after quite a little bit of ‘what do we want to see?’ conversation, we purchased the 72 hour Lisboa Pass which offers free or discounted admission to dozens of attractions.
Located in the Belém district, home to an amazing number of interesting attractions, Museu de Marinha, also known as the Maritime Museum or the Navy museum, is on the list with a 20% discount. So, instead of 7€ (US$7.65 at the time) we were admitted for only US$6.13 each.
The museum is located in one end of the Jerónimos Monastery building, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which is an attraction on its own. One we didn’t visit, BTW.

Let me tell you a story. This one takes us to Lisbon, Portugal, where I went to visit someone who has been my fairy godmother and her amazing husband. To protect her privacy, let’s call her “Ballerina.”
Now, Lisbon was everything you’d imagine, great people, great food, and endless opportunities to learn. Between physics, entropy, mountains, ballet, and Portuguese culture, my mind was buzzing. But, as always, the universe had a peculiar surprise in store for me. You see, Ballerina has this friend, Karma, who happens to be a Tibetan Buddhist Kempo monk. Yes, his name is as amazing as his wisdom. One day, we decided to head to the beach for some sun and sea after I met with folks from the World Bank to brainstorm ways to tackle water scarcity. Pretty typical day, right?
Well, here’s the twist: monks don’t usually carry swim trunks. So, what do you do when your monk friend wants to dip his toes in the ocean? You go and buy him a pink swimsuit, of course. Armed with this purchase, we made our way to the water, chatting about life, music, and whatever else crossed our minds. Turns out, Karma had spent some time in Mexico and spoke Spanish. This led us down a hilarious rabbit hole of Latin music, culminating in a spontaneous rendition of *Despacito*. There we were, a cosmologist, a Buddhist monk, and a theoretical physics PhD student, on a Portuguese beach, singing and dancing to a reggaeton hit. Life’s surreal moments, I tell you.
But wait, there’s more. I’m not exactly an ocean person. I grew up in the Andes, far from any sea, and I didn’t realize how quickly the water could chill me. As the sun set, my body temperature dropped fast, too fast. Ballerina, who, by the way, is not just an award-winning cosmologist and a ballerina but also a seasoned mountaineer, immediately noticed something was off. Her mountaineering instincts kicked in, and she got me out of the water before I turned into a human popsicle. After almost giving her a heart attack with my near-hypothermic state, we bundled me up and made it back home safe.
That trip wasn’t just about beaches, physics, or even *Despacito*. It was about being in the company of some of the most brilliant and fascinating minds I’ve ever met. Karma, in particular, taught me so much about the art of controlling the mind, meditating, and navigating emotions with clarity. It was like a crash course in mastering the internal chaos we all carry.
But more than anything, this trip reminded me of the simple joy in life’s beautiful chaos. The cliff, the mountains, the black cat, the dreams, the tree, the hedgehogs, the sunset, each a little piece of the puzzle. Between deep conversations, fresh ideas, and hours spent playing with their incredible kids, I felt myself rediscovering the wild, curious, and playful side of me. It’s the part that often gets buried under all the equations and theories, but it’s always there, waiting to come alive again.
Life’s better when it surprises you, isn’t it?

It was a nightmare to leave the “Estação Oriente” in Lisbon.
After spending a delightful few days in Porto, I boarded the AP train, eager to return to Lisbon.
The trip took me 3 good hours that I spent writing and communicating with my laptop. The train wifi was working properly.
However, as I arrived at the Lisbon train station (Aug 5), I found myself in an unexpected predicament.
The bustling station was packed with an ocean of people from all corners of the globe, and a wave of claustrophobia washed over me.
I felt in some ways lost and unsure of how to reach my hotel via the subway train.
Navigating through the sea of travelers proved to be a daunting task.
Each person seemed to be in a hurry, and it felt like the entire world had gathered in Lisbon to witness a momentous event — the Pope.
Feeling overwhelmed, I took a moment to compose myself and tried to spot any sign or direction for the subway.
However, it was not easy amidst the crowd. And every escalator was not working.

Two black socks hang from plastic clips above the Travessa da Cruz do Torel, an alleyway in Lisbon. I cut through the Jardim do Torel on the way to my favorite park. Yet I’ve never been this way, turning right instead of left when exiting the garden.
I lean upon the golden wall, taking in the details of the surroundings. Slanting shadows carry shade and slice the buildings into softer, darker tones.
High above the buildings, above the wire and the socks, sits the pale, subdued moon. I can’t fathom what it is — what it physically is — dust, rock, an assortment of matter. What I see, perhaps, isn’t dust drifting into darkness; I see something like a stone, patiently waiting to shine.
I can conceptualize a stone. When I look into the sky, it’s like a rock beneath a moving river; is that not what it is?
Later it’ll change, morph into a sphere of light, glistening from afar.
Its emergence means that night is falling, and that feels good. I feel the change of weather, the chilling of the breeze.

Having been woken up by an unpleasant noise I hear every morning Monday through Friday, I peeked at the darkness still reluctant to get up and saw nothing but furniture shapes. This time, I was quite thrilled to kick off the day because in just a few hours I would walk the streets of a city I never thought I’d visit.
Fast forward a couple of hours, a few airport checks and check-ins and one transit flight and I was finally there. Oh yes, and my arm was sore from carrying a few suitcases (thanks to my girlfriend), with that feeling of exhaustion as if coming home after a whole day’s work and a mediocre meal and no leg space for a 190-cm guy which caused me to twist and turn in my seat. But that’s the economy class ticket benefit you don’t get anywhere else. It is the airport company’s fault but I do often get — “Well, why are you that tall?”
Other than these minor inconveniences, the flight was good. I was here. Stepping out of the plane and walking for a change was a true remedy. I heard a whispering “Thank you” from my back and knees as I was willowing towards an airport exit.
Outside, palm trees dwarfed every building around it as they stood proudly, defying gravity. Above, the clear sky was chasing away the dark clouds that gathered in the night to water the city. They knew Lisbon was awaiting guests. The air was quite refreshing and it filled my lungs with energy after every breath. Comparing it to the cold Belgrade air, which is best felt with the scarf wrapped around your mouth, was pointless. It was a true marathon to get to the destination, yet I was more than eager to get the tour started. I couldn’t wait to see what the city had to offer.
The spring sun was shining bright. It is one of those days where you take your jacket with you, but it is warm enough during the day and you don’t need it. If you sit down, you can feel the wind creeping up your shirt sleeves, giving you goosebumps. So with my jacket on and off and on and off again, I was strolling the old parts of Lisbon.
Each building, house and structure of any kind, whether historical or not was a story for itself thanks to the bright blue, yellowish and white tiles covering it. The tiles, called azulejos, were used as decoration, but also to protect the buildings from the salty river and ocean air. It is the first thing that catches the eye, together with different kinds of tiles laid under your feet. Those painted pictures of ships, seas, winds and other things on the squares, streets, and sidewalks.
Walking through the city street I was faced with the dilemma to look down and up, as vibrant colors were everywhere with tiles reflecting the sun, giving you the warm and cozy feeling of familiarity and admiration.
It took me a while to fight against the hilly terrain to get to what I consider to be the main square — Praca do Comercio. It offers a marvelous view of the Tagus river which shows its full power exactly at this place, pushing the coast to the sides, stretching out as much as possible. One might be tricked to consider this to be the sea, partly due to the pleasant breeze coming at you. However, it is just the spot where you can see the full power and potential of nature, as the river narrows down a bit further “down the road” before it collides with the vastness of the cold and blue Atlantic. Seagulls are flying around, their song mixing with the people murmur and tram’s racket.
A few tiny white sails were seen on the river, while across, the remaining parts of the city are calling you to explore them, with much more greenery and sparse buildings.
The welcoming atmosphere invites you to sit on the curb, even in one of the surrounding cafes and just soak in everything around you. And that’s what I did. The sounds, the smells the view. It is all one needs to know about a city to recognize its soul, and it didn’t take me long to see Lisbon as my own.
As the sun retreats, the tiredness due to miles of walking and exploring caught up with me again, but just like upon the arrival, it was mixed with pleasure and peace.
And the sunsets…true Lisbon colors show up, the ones you cannot see during the day. With the remains of the day, the rush is over and satisfaction is painted on every face you encounter, tourist or local.
Sleep catches with you quickly when you lie down. I cannot remember what happened, but it was morning again. And that awful alarm sound, although it felt better this time. Getting down to the hotel lobby by elevator felt a bit painful due to aching in my legs, yet there was no choice. The city was calling me out to turn every corner, see every tile and smell the air from hills and valleys.
Alfama is a city within a city. I decided to walk across it and it was a mistake from the start. Uphill and downhill terrain made this area specific, with no flat parts. To me, it all seemed uphill, especially after a few hours. Luckily, you can get on the vintage yellow tram which is one of the symbols of the city and ride up, before you get off and walk uphill. Again. Endless elevation. And just like the other areas, Alfama is colorful and vibrant but there’s something special about it, something mysterious that I couldn’t define.
My stomach started complaining, which meant that the entire itinerary changed and the first place I wanted to get to was the restaurant. Suddenly, all those historical places became “meh” as human biology stepped in.
Lisbon is a perfect city for fish lovers. Fish is all over the menus and all I desired at that point was salmon — and boy, oh boy, it was terrific. Add a squeeze of lemon on top of it, with a fresh salad as the side dish and it is a perfect combination. No bones to pick just a light yet fulfilling meal.
While all of that was happening, a fado trio was playing the background, a local band, performing here and there, and it was all that was missing. They hit the right note as the sun was setting over Alfama.
The moment I landed at the Belgrade airport, I was happy to be home, yet sadness filled my inner being. The city was grey and colorless, with people rushing all over the place, going in the wrong direction. It was cold outside and the cold reached all the way to my bones. I already missed the sunny hillsides and building tops, the uneven grounds and the atmosphere which seemed to be more welcoming.
I was back in my everyday routine. Yet, on every cloudy and misty day, I remember the Lisbon sun, shining bright!
Until we meet again!

Three days in June
I went straight toward the Tagus River walking across the shopping. This is the ""Parque das Nações"", Lisbon.
Recently I made a trip by train from Porto to Lisbon.
The Alfa pendular comfort 1st class is easy and tranquil.
It takes almost 3 horas from Campanhã station in Porto to Oriente station in Lisbon.
The train has wifi you can work during the trip. I felt a little dizzy and had to stop my work.
When arriving in the city… the Orient station is connected to the Vasco da Gama shopping mall and the metro station.
If you take the subway the first thing anyone will notice is the art poetry and murals of the metro stations. They inspire people all day long.
On the wall written in Portuguese on blue azulejos (tile art)…
""A verdade que eu conto, nua e pura vence toda grandiloca escritura."" Luis de Camões, Os Luziadas.

Nestled along the banks of the Tagus River in Lisbon’s vibrant Parque das Nações district is the Vasco da Gama Tower, an architectural gem that marries Portugal’s rich maritime heritage with contemporary design.
Rising to 145 meters (476 feet), it is the tallest structure in Portugal and a symbol of the city’s forward-looking spirit.
Named after the famed Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the first European to reach India by sea, the tower embodies the adventurous spirit that propelled Portugal to the forefront of the Age of Discoveries.
Its design is inspired by the billowing sails of a caravel, the iconic ship that carried explorers like da Gama to uncharted territories. This homage is not just in name but in the tower's silhouette against Lisbon’s skyline.
Designed by architects Leonor Janeiro and Nick Jacobs in collaboration with the engineering firm SOM (Skidmore, Owings & Merrill), the Vasco da Gama Tower was originally constructed for Expo ’98, the World’s Fair hosted by Lisbon in 1998.
The event commemorated the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama’s voyage to India and spurred significant urban development…

A new chapter. A new adventure.
Lisbon has slowly but surely won me over. It’s a city where I’ve decided to pause and settle for a while, despite the numerous considerations that influenced this decision. Now, I’m excited to share my journey in Lisbon, including my discoveries of its food, cafes, and various other delights.
This isn’t my first experience living abroad. Before Lisbon, I spent six years in Izmir, Türkiye, which was no small stint, especially since I moved there when I was just 18. Now, I’ve chosen to continue my journey in Lisbon, though the future might see me moving elsewhere or perhaps returning to my home country, Indonesia. For now, Lisbon is my home, and I can’t wait to explore and share its wonders.
Visiting Lisbon as a tourist, I found the city to be incredibly charming and lovely. However, by moving here made me realise how hill-y this city is! I arrived in September, at that time it was still pretty warm — maybe around 30+C, I was sweating all the time!
Surprisingly, I’ve adapted! I’ve learned to control my breathing, maintain a steady walking pace, and navigate the public transportation system, which has helped me avoid excessive walking and sweating — obviously 🤣. Now, I can truly appreciate all that Lisbon has to offer, both its beauty and its challenges.
Coming to Lisbon without knowing Portuguese has been surprisingly manageable, as most people here speak English. However, this convenience has made me a bit “lazy” about learning the language — I think I took it for granted somehow. Despite this, I’m starting to learn Portuguese, albeit slowly, and I’m doing my best to speak it as much as possible. Even though people in restaurants, cafes, and other places often ask me to speak in English instead, I appreciate their understanding of my struggle to even form a single sentence 🥹
Like many European countries, I don’t have particularly problems on finding Asian foods in Lisbon. There are some restaurants which are pretty good, however I am still in the mission finding the best ones here. Beside Asian cuisines, there are other lots of foods choices. I have my favourite bagel place, coffee (even the overpriced one 🤣☕️), and local food like Francesinha (I like this a lot!). I will make different writings about it — Lisbon food review!
Surprisingly, there is a big Asian supermarket here, quite close with the airport and decent pricing. Mostly products from China, but they have quite variable options from Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese. As I am Asian myself, having this HUGE supermarket is a blessing! 😇
There are foods that I am quite familiar here in Portugal which is pretty similar like in Indonesia, they have different fillings — like Risoles, Croquete, and some biscuits (like cat-tongue, etc).
So, food culture in Portugal is quite rich. I don’t think I ever have food shock here in extreme ways! Don’t worry if want to move or live here, your stomach will be fine and full too 🍽️
Diversity is a thing here in Lisbon, I think it is nice to have such a diverse community. People are surprisingly warm and friendly tho. According to the European Commission’s survey about Quality of life in European cities in 2023, 94% population agreed that the city is a good place to live in general. For me in general, Lisbon is a safe city. Obviously like another cities in the world, there are sketchy neighbourhoods and crimes, but I found in general is pretty safe. So far, I don’t have negative experiences here.
I think I’ve written quite a bit here, so I’ll wrap it up for now. There’s much more to share about Lisbon, so stay in touch! More stories to come. See you soon!

In February of 2016, I started a new experience in my life. I was cast as the leader of a team (a team of two, at the time, including myself, though having grown a lot more since then…) that would work with a US company.
Almost two years have passed since and now it’s time for a new challenge. It’s also time to reevaluate the time and experiences taken from it.
First things first. For the first few months, I will try to minimize any disruption as best as I can. In the beginning, I’m all about understanding everything that’s in and around the company. How they work, who the people are, and how they get along together. Understanding how they think helps me to adjust my discourse to something that would be more familiar to them, more inline with what they’ve come to expect so far.
I’m always careful with my first interactions. I have seen many times in my life people coming along and, in attempting to be helpful, start right away trying to fix any issues that may come their way. In my view, this approach, while sometimes needed, is rarely successful. People will usually see it as a source of disruption. You won’t have a full understanding of the problems or how they came about, and how they have tried to solve them in the past.
So I start by listening. I listen to interactions, I try to understand inside jokes, understand what worries they might have ( big or small ) on a personal and professional level. I usually try to avoid making any major decisions without understand all of the problematic.
Before this, I only had the experience of working with people that mostly were beside me or at least within the same city. When presented with this challenge I immediately identified two important issues — Not sharing the same space and different timezones. I started to read a lot about remote working, and even though most of it referred to individuals rather than a team setting, the underlying principles still apply, so I could already see some issues that we were bound to face.
So how do you connect and work with people taking into account these possible issues? You communicate! You over communicate! You spend a lot of time talking to be on the same page.
Communication will also help when different cultures are in play. I spend some time understanding not only how they are as individuals, but also the cultural traces in their personalities. And whatever I didn’t understand I would ask. An expression, a feeling, some sarcastic remark, or jokes that I didn’t get… I much prefer to ask than sit there guessing.
I found a great team with awesome individuals on the client side. When we came onboard, with us being an offshore team, it is easy to start setting up a divide between people. Us and them. Them and us. Fortunately, the client is amazing and they had the same way of thinking as I did!
They gave us company emails. We had access to the same communications channels as them. We got access to staging and production servers. We got t-shirts! They treated us, and expected from us, the same as any person in their company.
No one gains from one side being treated differently. For me, the only way for this to work as best as possible is through letting the offshore team be completely integrated with the process/spirit of the client. Of course, there’s a large component of trust involved, but with this kind of attitude, they’ll gain people eager to help since they share the client goals and view them as their own.
It is important to note that this is something that needs to be addressed on both sides and is a never ending story, a continuous and ongoing effort. It can happen naturally, but you also have to create and nurture an environment where people can continue to grow and feel valued.
Sometimes you will make mistakes… I believe it’s not a matter of if but when. You will have an unexpected behaviour, or you will introduce a bug in the system. At some point in time, you will do something that’s not in the greater plan of things.
What are the next steps? Tell the truth! Admit your mistake.
Maybe they will understand, maybe they won’t. One thing is for sure though, you will grow and strengthen the bonds that everyone shares. I see no harm in making mistakes, the problem is when people don’t admit to them.
From the first day, I try to remove any dependency on us that the client might have. If I see something that might create a dependency I try to plan how to remove it. Are we the only ones with knowledge on some part of the platform? Let’s pass that knowledge on to someone on the client’s side. For some clients we’re the only source of technology on their team. When that happens we have to be extra careful and try to complement that with a better knowledge base on the tech side of things.
I do the same on a team level ( I’ve written about that subject in a different blog post ), so I apply the same principle. “Isn’t it great for business if I create dependency?” — I hear you ask. Of course it is, but that isn’t the way we work. We want people to work with us because we are great at what we do; not because they are shackled to us due to an over-reliance on what we know.
This was a great experience! The things I’ve learned from working with a different country and timezone; for a different culture, with different views, is something that has helped me to grow immensely! Sharing knowledge and views and understanding the culture was an awesome experience.
If you have any comments or feedback on this subject, I’d love to hear from you!
Nowadays I’m working in my own company trying to bring some products ( like https://isdown.app ) to life. Besides product development, I love to build and scale engineering teams. If you have any questions, feel free to ping me on Twitter or LinkedIn or just leave a comment.

By sheer luck, we arrived in Lisbon during Festa de Santiago Antonio (The Feast of Saint Anthony). This month-long celebration of Anthony of Padua (who is actually not the patron saint of Lisbon but is preferred by the locals) sees the city transform into a spectacular carnival. The streets are decorated with colorful ribbons, street food stalls are packed into every open corner, cold beer flows from the taps, and the air smells of grilled anchovies.
Saint Anthony is also referred to as the holy matchmaker. During each festival, 16 lucky couples get to wed in a lavish ceremony!
We spent most of our days in Lisbon walking and eating, eating and walking. Since Lisbon is known as “the city of seven hills,” it was easy to work up an appetite. Even coming from San Francisco (which is quite hilly) we were impressed by the steepness of several streets. To address the challenges of getting from point A to B in the city, many of the steeper streets have funicular trains ready to ferry people up and down the hills.
We treated ourselves to the street food stalls on many many occasions…
Our host also shared his cooking with us!
On our third day, we took the ferry across Tagus Bay to the city of Cacilhas and followed an abandoned road along the water. This road eventually led to a statue of Christ the Redeemer, a monument inspired by the one in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. This statue (inaugurated in 1959) was created to express gratitude that the Portuguese were spared the worst effects of World War II. It also looks over the April 25 bridge…which looks awfully familiar to the one we just left behind.
In 1775, one of Europe’s most powerful earthquakes hit Lisbon (estimated to be between 8.0 and 9.0). The earthquake struck during a holiday morning and did catastrophic damage, killing an estimated 60,000 people and destroying 85% of the city. Subsequent fires then burned in Lisbon for over 6 days and a tsunami with waves over 20 feet hit the shore.
The pic below is from the Alfama neighborhood. This neighborhood is one of the oldest in the city having been spared the worst of the earthquake damage.
Sadly, 5 days weren’t near enough for Lisbon (or Portugal obviously)! Hoping we will return!
Olá- hello
Obrigad(a/o) — thanks (the o or a depends on the gender of the SPEAKER… confusing for my Spanish-oriented brain)
Saúde-cheers!

Kristina, I am glad to meet you and am simply enchanted by your artworks — I cannot find a better name to describe what you do. Let’s start from the very beginning. Your passion for photography and your first creative steps took place… Where and when?
I was born and raised in the southern part of Ukraine. Since I was a very artistic child, my parents used the opportunity — they introduced me to all kinds of creative expression: painting, music, dancing. I was fond of seeing the beauty of the moment and at some point, — around age 7–8 years old — when my grandparents bought one of those first digital cameras, I started taking photos. Just shooting everything I saw around — mostly nature. Of course, not all of the shots, but some, made my grandpa admit “Oh, she’s a good eye!”.It was the very beginning of my photography path. Hence, shooting nature still attracts me — it is a way of meditation and a source of inspiration for me.Another way of expressing my mood and showcasing creativity was artistic shooting with a good friend from my school. We used to dress up and invent themed photoshoots, crafting all the details from scratch with our own hands — they were important — and incorporating a touch of aesthetics to each picture.Finally, I kept forgetting and belittling one important point — my photos were displayed in a town hall exhibition in my hometown. It was literally the whole exhibition of my photographs. Talking about it now, I feel goosebumps.
So nature was your primary shooting experience. What about developing your eye and style? What kind of photography mostly attracts you now? What would you call your favorite style and does it allow experimenting?
Since humans are a part of nature, I love shooting portraits and body portraits. Now I will explain myself better. When I take a photo, I try to capture the expression so that the dialogue between the person and their sensations is seen in the picture. There is much more than face and body when it comes to seeing body language. I find gestures, movement, shapes, and sights even more important than the primary image, clothing sets, and surroundings. I like minimalistic photos, which speak to people’s hearts more than to their brains and eyes. However, aesthetics are very important to me — I always see it in details and (people say) am good at showcasing it.
Is there anything really special for you during the photoshoot? Something you can never omit.
My point is using the photoshoot as a therapy. It is an intimate process which I can really compare to a confession. The camera sees a lot. However, I have 3 main rules for any shooting to take place smoothly. Before we shoot , we need to meet and have a talk over a coffee or tea, or whatever. It helps the person to open up and feel more comfortable.And the second thing is that the person should understand what they feel like during the process. It is essential, as the sensations and feelings cannot be hidden once snapped with a camera. That’s why I need the first step of meeting before the shoot — so there is no intimidation, but freedom and comfort.Rule number 3 is putting myself into the model’s shoes from time to time — it makes me understand how a person in front of the camera feels in different situations. In case I realize there are some points making me uncomfortable as a model, I avoid them in my own shoots.
Are there any taboos for you? What would you never shoot?
My principle goes far beyond any taboos — I try everything at least once. Otherwise, how would I know if there is something I like or I don’t like? Every kind of art is unique and it might make you come up with some deep ideas — it will make you broaden your skills or knowledge.I am pretty much philosophical in this aspect. Everything can take place, unless it is your own experience telling you that you don’t like it.
An idea as your motto during your lifetime? Or a couple of them…
In my opinion , there is always something going on in life which can change our perception, our opinion , and our principles. So there is no constant definition of what guides me in life other than changes. I guess there is a saying that the only permanent thing in life is change. And this is what I totally agree with. The strategy can change according to your goals, your values , and your sensations — and it would be a very poor decision to follow only one rule for the whole of your life.

In Lisbon’s Mouraria, the birthplace of a legend.
Fado (“Fate”) is Portuguese “Blues” music born in the slums of Lisbon in the 1820s…Well, that’s the kind of intro you might expect to read in an article about Fado. To our surprise, flaneuring through the winding streets of the Mouraria in the oldest part of Lisbon, Teresa and I discovered the actual birthplace of the woman whose music marked the emergence of Fado from the shadows into the light.
The plan for the day, in as much as there was one, was to start at the Chapel of Our Lady of Health, at the bottom of the Mouraria, wander through the backways until we got hungry, and then find our way to Zé da Mourari, a traditional Portuguese restaurant that Teresa particularly wanted to try.
The chapel was built as an appeal to the Virgin Mary for her to intercede with God and save the city from the plague, which ravaged Lisbon during the 16th Century. The crowned statue of Mary at the front of the chapel is still paraded around the neighborhood once each year in thanks for her deliverance.
Just behind the church, the roads zigzag up and along the hillside towards Sao Jorge Castle, through the Mouraria, one of the few parts of the city that survived the earthquake of 1755. The name means “Moor-area.” It’s the old quarter of the city where the muslims were confined after the Christian reconquest of Lisbon in 1147. Because of its narrow winding alleyways and crooked streets, The Mouraria remained a magnet for outcasts. It attracted a rougher crowd of immigrants, sailors and sex-workers. Now it’s just starting to emerge as a rather hip part of Lisbon, while still keeping its authentic character.
Strangely enough, as we soon discovered, many of the immigrant in this neighborhood today are from Bangladesh — the new muslims who are welcomed to Portugal. It’s obvious not only from the restaurants and stores with Bengali signs, but also from the colorful men’s sarongs hanging out the windows to dry with the laundry. Even the graffiti and street art has a Bengali flair.
We wandered around until our feet got sore, then headed in the general direction of the restaurant. The road narrowed, then widened into a tiny square with two trees loaded with oranges in the center. The houses here were old, not more than two stories, with some of the doors laughably tiny. The artwork on the walls was playful yet beautifully done. We were captivated.
The walls contained some clever visual jokes, like this woman blowing miniature ballerinas towards a cat…
And this door with a poem scrawled next to it that reads: “I want my love/There is no other/I want my love/There goes another!”
We noticed at the far end of the little square a gleaming white building that seemed almost out of place in the scruffy but well-decorated little square. A sign on the building explained that this square was named in honor of Fado legend Maria Severa, who was born in this house in 1820 and lived in this neighborhood.
Her father was a gypsy, her mother owned a tavern and was a sex-worker known as “ Barbuda” — the bearded one. Maria, however, was great beauty by all accounts, and perhaps unavoidably fell into her mother’s profession. She sang early Fado songs in the taverns and brothels of the Mouraria. According to one source (Lisboa, a Love Affair), she was the first person to sing fados in the street, accompanying herself on guitar and composing her own lyrics. She sang about her life and her problems: love and heartbreak, betrayal, jealousy, revenge, tragedy; the same problems as the people she lived among. Her style of Fado became wildly popular. Indeed, one has to wonder if strands of this acceptance of hardship that will break the soul might have gone all the way back to the moors left to fend for themselves on this hill.
There are no portraits of Maria, but here are some descriptions written by various writers who met her: (with thanks to my source Atlas Lisboa):
Writer Luis Augusto Palmeirim: When I entered Severa’s house, a modest dwelling of the vulgar type her unlucky peers inhabit, there she was, smoking, leaning back on a straw couch, wearing polishing slippers dotted with red twine, a silk flowery kerchief on her head and the sleeves of her dress rolled up to the elbows. She was a rather swarthy, thin, nervous woman, remarkable for her magnificent peninsular eyes. On the gaming table laid a guitar, the inseparable companion to her triumphs.
Poet Bulhão Pato: It will be difficult for another Severa to appear, haughty and impetuous, so generous as ready to punch the face of whoever would act rogue on her! Brave, full of affection for the ones she cared for, as well as rough to her enemies, She was no ordinary woman, you can be sure of that.
One of her lovers was the Count of Vimioso, a “bohemian” aristocrat who used to take Maria out to bullfights. This gave her exposure beyond the Mouraria. She was hired to sing at parties in high society, and her reputation grew. Tragically, Maria died of tubuculosis at the age of twenty six. However according to Lisboa, a Love Affair, what she really died of was a broken heart, because the social difference between her and the count was never going to allow a marriage between them: “She actually died poor and abandoned, of tuberculosis, in a miserable brothel on Rua do Capelão, on November 30, 1846…Her last words are said to have been: ‘I die without ever having lived’ — She was 26 years old.”
Something in her music had quickened the heart of Lisbon. Fado had changed because of her; it became this powerful expression of desire crushed by fate. Because of Maria, Fado moved from the shadows into popular culture. Her life became a legend, then the subject of a novel, then a play, which in 1933 was turned into the first Portugese movie ever made with sound.
As Teresa and I strolled from the little square that bore the legend’s name, I thought about the shrines to these two Marias, just a few short blocks from one another. The people of Lisbon loved the Virgin Mary because she saved them from their fate. They loved Maria Severa because she sang about their fate. She transformed their sorrow into more than simply suffering. She made it into something beautiful and holy.

TLDR there were some interesting talks at remote Web Summit this year, but the real value of Web Summit is the ad-hoc meeting and chatting with people, seeing what startups from across the world are working on, and seeing just in general what the tech world is up to. All of which is much more difficult remotely.
Last week I attended the Web Summit tech conference for what I think was the 6th time. I went two or maybe three times in Dublin (I must be getting old if I can’t remember my conference visits!), twice in Lisbon, and now once from the comfort of my MacBook in Kildare.
You can read previous reviews of my colleagues and I’s trips — 2017 here and 2018 here, and they’re obviously quite different from the experience this year. Going to Lisbon was of course part of the fun, but even when it was in Dublin and I just had to walk across the road from my office in Ballsbridge to the RDS, being there in person was infinitely better.
Most talks at tech conferences are interesting at best, boring at worst, but rarely have anything revelatory; for the most part you are unlikely to hear anything you didn’t know already. AWS re:Invent being the obvious exception, where they launch new services at the event — but even with these you can always watch the repeats online afterwards.
One advantage of Web Summit however is the sheer scale — it is huge, with more talks running in parallel for several days than you’d ever get to see — so when it was held in person there are always diamonds among the rough, and if a talk isn’t that good you just stroll over to another one. Remotely however it was difficult to stay focused on the talks, and trying to find the good ones, when work and real life were also competing.
Throughout the three days, even though I’d kept meetings to a minimum, I found myself working on my current project and sending emails more than I spent “at” the conference. It was hard to justify to myself postponing working on an important new feature for watching something online; I always feel pressure to deliver in work, and when I wasn’t actually in a different country at an event, it felt slightly wrong to be sitting there watching talks when I could be building.
There were some exceptions — I saw a great talk by Siemens’ Carolina Alves & Francisco Freitas on using machine learning to recognise dangerous driving in traffic. Their talk was a detailed and honest account of their work, how they gathered and labeled data (a hackathon!) and more. AI and ML is already becoming so important to business, and I love seeing real-world examples like this of putting it into practice.
I saw another refreshingly honest talk, again also by Siemens (Aymeric Sarrazin and CTO Peter Keorte), about IoT, where even though the title was “How IoT will change the world”, they discussed how there is still a lot of work to be done before happens and that IoT is an enabler of change, as oppose to the change in itself.
I attended others which were good also, and I had a lot marked down in my schedule, but I found myself missing a lot of them as I got distracted by my “real” work.
Most of my time at the physical Web Summits was spent just wandering around the huge halls, browsing the startup stands and chatting with people if something looked interesting. Most of the big outfits also had stands, usually with an interesting piece of tech to try out — like in 2017 when I got to try out a quick development tutorial on the HoloLens:
This year there was none of that, at least for me anyway. I was contacted by a fair few people looking to have a “virtual coffee”, and it’s always good to meet people, but these were mostly sales pitches. I missed the casual conversations, seeing companies and projects that I wasn’t expecting to see, and the learning which comes from being immersed for a few days in all things tech.
Web Summit used to have organised pub crawls aswell, which as well as great for seeing more of beautiful Lisbon, was another fun way to meet and network with people from across the world. The most networking I got done this week was with a 2 year old who loves trying to mash my keyboard as I’m working.
I’m hoping the world can return to some level of normal next year and the Web Summit and other conferences can return to what they were, but this year’s won’t be making the top 5. Or is that 6?
I have to mention that I’m fully aware that being stuck at home and not enjoying a few days in Lisbon is not in any way hardship; I’m safe at home, with a great job that allows me to attend events like this, remote or otherwise.
I’ve friends in healthcare who risk their lives every day for the rest of us, so any complaints here are not real complaints, I know how privileged I am to blogging about tech conferences!
Any thoughts or comments, let me know below, or feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or Twitter. You can learn more about my company, Liberty IT here and yes, we’re hiring!

Lisbon is a must visit while traveling to Europe. It is a very affordable city compared to most in Western Europe, but doesn’t skip out on great food, excellent site seeing, and amazing shopping.
My Experience
After graduating college in the Spring of 2022, my girlfriend and I took a month long trip to Europe. Our final destination was Lisbon before flying back to Miami. Let me just say, it was a great way to end our trip on a high note.
Food
Lisbon had some great eats everywhere we went. I would say a big highlight was TimeOut Market. This was a huge food market in which you had the option of any kind of food you are in the mood for. Everything we tried here was delicious. We also made sure to try Portugal’s famous pastry, Pastel de Nada, at multiple locations. This sweet treat with some espresso was always an amazing way to start off the day.
The biggest food standout of Lisbon was a slice of chocolate cake, see below. This is easily the best cake I have ever eaten in my life. I would travel back to Lisbon just to have another slice. If you ever visit Lisbon, eating this cake should be the number 1 thing to do on your list.

There is something perplexing about attempting to express oneself in any language. This issue becomes more salient when what we are trying to articulate is an experience rife with a mosaic of sentiments too complex to comprehend outright, let alone to transform into words. The constant urge to do so, though, does not emerge out of nothing. Our compulsion is primarily driven by an inexplicable urge to dress fuzzy pre-conceptual experiences in words that we understand in order to be able to share them with others. In an attempt to capture fleeting experiences we have, we might try everything at our disposal to grab on to, and subsequently frame, memories that seem to make our lives more colorful, in hopes of chiseling ourselves into becoming interesting individuals not only vis a vis ourselves, but also in the eyes of others.
We encounter such an interesting example in the novel Night Train to Lisbon written by the philosophy professor Peter Bieri under the pseudonym Pascal Mercier. At the very beginning the protagonist of the story (Raimund Gregorius), a teacher of classics at a Gymnasium in the city of Bern, Switzerland, has an encounter which would forever change his life.
On his way to school, Gregorius meets a lady wearing a red coat standing on the Kirchenfeld Bridge, ready to jump and end her life. No sooner than Gregorius realizes this than he rushes to try and stop her — and he does so successfully. She later on accompanies him to school, and along the way he learns that her native language was Portuguese.
As banal and mundane this happenstance might seem, it was sufficient to turn Gregorius’ life upside down in a way he wouldn’t have imagined.
The experience itself might have had nothing to do with the radical decisions he would subsequently make, but it definitely played a rather crucial role in the abrupt shift that would see him embarking on an odyssey of self-discovery and transformation.
Experiences of this calibre tend to instigate us to brusquely but intentionally decide to change the course of our lives as a consequence of an inevitable outburst due to the endless, unconscious, accumulation of selves that one keeps hoarding with the passing of time.
One day we think we’re going to start a new job at our dream company, the other we find ourselves doing something we wouldn’t have imagined doing not in a hundred years time. Change is infinitesimal and can be very difficult to discern. Crossing a certain threshold, we look in the mirror and understand that we cannot recognize ourselves anymore. Where does this dissonance come from though? Why is it too difficult to ‘go with the flow’, to give in to the uncertainties of life, and incorporate change as a core feature of life? These questions present themselves in their blinding clarity when on a day like any other Gregorius is stricken by a sudden realization that he did not know who he was anymore.
In a fate-like circumstance, Gregorius knew that something was different the second he met the lady in red standing on the bridge reading a paper under the rain. Somehow this event made him decide to leave his stuff behind and walk away from school without looking back.
Driven by a curious desire to plunge himself into the unknown, the initial contours of the rebellion against his previous self materialized in the form of breakfast, which he left intact, at a hotel’s restaurant where he had never been before.
After that, he visited a Spanish library that he used to frequent. The concatenation of events led him to stumble upon a book, written in Portuguese, left behind on a table by a customer. The encounter with the lady in red was still haunting him, and it seemed to him that the pieces of the puzzle were coming right into place.
Gregorius knew that the compass of his exciting new endeavor was pointing in the right direction when the first paragraph, which he made the owner of the library read and translate for him, said the following:
“Of thousand experiences we have, we find language for one at most and even this one merely by chance and without the care it deserves. Buried under all the mute experiences are those unseen ones that give our life its form, its color, and its melody. Then, when we turn to these treasures, as archeologists of the soul, we discover how confusing they are. The subject of contemplation refuses to stand still, the words bounce off the experience and in the end, pure contradictions stand on the paper. For a long time, I thought it was a defect, something to be overcome. Today I think it’s different: that recognition of the confusion is the ideal path to understanding these intimate yet enigmatic experiences. That sounds strange, even bizarre, I know. But ever since I have seen the issue in this light, I have the feeling of being really awake and alive for the first time.”
It was a passage that resonated strongly with him, so much so that he decided to jump on a train to Lisbon to track down the writer of the book titled A Goldsmith of Words by Amadeu de Prado. De Prado, as Gregorius would eventually figure out, was a medical doctor who had helped treat one of the central figures of the Salazar regime. Motivated by a sense of guilt at having saved the Butcher of Lisbon’s life, he decided to join the resistance in penitence for his ‘sin’.
In a sense, Gregorius was on a journey of self-discovery that was primarily guided by a curiosity to learn more about the biography of Amadeu de Prado. Perhaps, he thought to himself, he would know more about himself by getting to walk in the shoes of someone else. During the ‘search’, Gregorius had the time to contemplate and reflect upon himself by recalling important episodes of his life when he had to make crucial decisions, and to imagine alternative scenarios in the case that he had chosen differently. Deciphering de Prado’s book, he thought to himself, he would be able to authentically know himself more profoundly.
However, two things scared Gregorius during the quest made more than anything else: 1) falling unconscious because of recurrent episodes of dizziness, which he thought, could cause memory loss, and 2) seeing any doctor whom he didn’t know because fearing that the doctor would make him lose himself.
This latter was a major source of concern right before getting some medicals done following the advice of his Ophthalmologist. “What if they find something bad? Something that would make me lose myself?” Gregorius asked him.
Gregorius’ dealt with his terrible hypochondria-like fear by finding recourse in the static, dead languages of the past, like ancient Greek and Hebrew. However, one of de Prado’s reflections cited below, prompted him to reexamine his views.
“Maybe it’s like this: I’d like to rearrange Portuguese words. The sentences that would emerge from this new order must not be odd or eccentric, not exalted, affected or artificial. They must be archetypal sentences in Portuguese so that you have the feeling that they originated directly and from the transparent, sparkling nature of this language. The words must be as unblemished as polished marble, and they must be pure as the notes in a Back partita, which turn everything that is not themselves into a perfect silence. Sometimes, when I am feeling more tolerant about the linguistic morass, I think, it could be the easy silence of a living room or the relaxed silence between lovers. But when I am totally possessed by rage over the clichéd use of words, then it must be nothing less than the clear, cool silence of outer space, where I make my solitary way as the only person who speaks Portuguese.”
For Gregorius, the passage felt like a call to return to the basics of a language in order to reinvent it in an attempt to capture the concreteness of life experiences. The result, as de Prado suggests, would be an ‘unblemished, laconic text’; a language that, while not completely new, succeeds to express beautifully the essence of inner experiences.
De Prado’s reflection underscores a human necessity to continuously renew oneself like a chrysalis throughout different stages in our lives.
Externally, this idea manifests in the form of excessive consumption. Buying the latest model of any product seems to satisfy a lurking desire to periodically renew and revitalize ourselves.
Internally, it manifests in the form of a constant struggle to articulate the mounting change in our idiosyncrasies which according to de Prado and Gregorius, can be achieved by waxing lyrical in the hopes of capturing our concrete experiences through a genuine discourse rather than by alluding to concepts or languages long dead.
This is echoed by Amadeu de Prado’s reflections where he asserts that expressing oneself anew can be achieved by twisting the language to resuscitate faded concepts in order to make them adapt to our continuously evolving life experiences.
Unfortunately, this struggle never ends because as Nietzsche, who had a fine grasp of this interminable dance, eloquently writes:
“Alas! what are you, my written and my painted thoughts! Not long ago you were young and malicious and full of thorns and secret spices- you made me sneeze and laugh- and now? You have doffed your novelty, and some of you, I fear, are ready to become truths, so immortal do they look, so tediously honest! And was it ever otherwise? What then do we write and paint, we mandarins with Chinese brush? Alas, only that which is about to fade and lose its scent! Alas, only birds exhausted by flight, which let themselves be caught with our hand! We immortalize things exhausted and mellow! And it is only for your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have many colors; but nobody will divine how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved- wicked thoughts!”

Have you ever found yourself running on empty, going through the motions without really feeling connected to what you’re doing?
That’s where I was before this trip. There’s a point when you realize you’re just… tired. Not just physically, but emotionally and creatively. I needed this trip not just to escape but to find myself again.
We live in a world that worships hustle, where productivity is often measured by how much we do, how busy we are, and how little we rest. I’ve always been someone who pushes through, who keeps going even when I know I’m running on nothing but coffee and maybe sugar lol. But as I wandered through the streets of Barcelona, from the towering Sagrada Familia to the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter, I realized something.
These iconic places are filled with life and energy, but instead of feeling energized, I realized I was missing the point. I was so focused on seeing everything and doing everything that I wasn’t truly experiencing any of it. Even on the subway, surrounded by people, I felt disconnected, like I was just going through the motions. It hit me that maybe, just maybe, it was okay to slow down and not do it all.
Rest isn’t just about lying down or sitting still. It’s about giving yourself permission to move at your own pace, to let go of the need to be constantly productive. As I walked through the narrow streets of Alfama, I felt something shift. The colorful buildings, the quiet moments — they invited me to slow down and just be.
Sitting at Castelo de Sao Jorge, looking out over the city, I didn’t feel the usual urge to capture the perfect photo or check off the next item on the list. Instead, I let myself just enjoy the view, the company, the moment. When we wandered into a little perfume store, it wasn’t about buying something; it was about the simple pleasure of experiencing something new, something beautiful, without any pressure. These small moments reminded me that it’s okay to simply exist, to find joy in the present.
Something I hadn’t expected was how much inspiration I would find just by slowing down and paying attention. In the midst of the busy streets, the street art, the intricate tiles, the history embedded in the architecture — even these chairs all over Barcelona — it all started to speak to me in a way I hadn’t felt in a long time.
Everywhere I looked, there was something that sparked my imagination — a piece of street art that made me pause, a beautifully tiled floor that told a story, even the way the buildings stood, each with its own history and character. It reminded me that creativity isn’t always about creating; sometimes, it’s about observing, about letting the world around you fill you with new ideas and perspectives. I realized that inspiration is everywhere if you just take the time to see it.
But beyond the beauty of the cities and the inspiration I found in the streets, what really stayed with me were the moments of connection. Sharing a meal, laughing with friends, those little moments of joy — they’re what made this trip truly meaningful. Like when we finally got our hands on those infamous Pastel da Nata from Pasteis de Belem — AMAZING.
Whether it was enjoying crepes, chatting at the plaza while eating gelato at midnight, or just sitting down for brunch at 4 p.m. because we felt like it — these moments weren’t about doing something impressive. They were about being present with the people I care about, about savoring life in its simplest, most joyful forms. And honestly, that’s where I found the most rest — in those small, meaningful moments that reminded me of what’s really important.
As I walked down the well in Quinta da Regaleira, it felt like a metaphor for what this trip had been — descending into the unknown, into a place of quiet and reflection. And just like that well, this journey brought me back up, feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to move forward. I realized that rest is its own form of productivity. It’s in those moments of stillness and quiet that we find the clarity we need to truly grow.”
I came on this trip looking for a break, a way to recharge. What I found was that rest isn’t just about doing nothing — it’s about finding the space to reconnect with yourself and to rediscover what brings you joy and peace.
So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this trip, it’s that it’s okay to take a step back. To slow down, to rest, and to reconnect with what really matters. When you give yourself permission to rest, you’re not just recharging — you’re laying the foundation for everything that comes next.

With ample sun, sights, and awesome food, there’s a ton to see and do in Lisbon, Portugal. The real magic of Lisbon comes from exploring its side streets and alleys, but there’s so much to experience all around that a good plan is needed. It’s also a spread out and hilly city, so making the most of it involves some walking and creative use of the public transportation. With a short amount of time or compressed schedule in this glimmering historic city, make sure to make the most of it to see and do the best this city has to offer.

You know when someone has a YouTube video that they want you to watch sooo badly and they SWEAR it is hysterical and that you are going to absolutely LOVE it?
And somehow the more they tell you how much you’re going to love to it, the more it kinda makes you want to not like it out of stubborn principle?
By the time you finally say “fk it” and watch the damn video to get them off your back, you’re forced into one of those super awkward fake laughs just so you don’t hurt their feelings and look like a huge asshole.
Yeah, that’s kinda how I felt about Portugal going into month 3.
I’ll preface this by saying that following Prague would be unfair for any city on our itinerary in my opinion. I had just gotten into a groove by the end of last month and was feeling all of those homey vibes I talked about in my recap post.
It sounds dumb, I know, but I have been feeling the pressure to love Lisbon this first week. I think it’s a combination of how bummed I was to leave Prague, how every site seems to have Portugal in its “Top Destinations for 2017”, and how much people who have been here before told me how much I’m going to like it. Whatever the reasoning, it just didn’t wow me right off the bat.
I’m that annoying kind of person who likes things less when people tell you how you’re going to react to them. It applies to most things — YouTube vids, songs, TV shows, and apparently cities.
I’m fully aware that it’s so stupid and that Lisbon really is incredible…it just took me a couple days to forgive it for being #notprague.
All of that being said, after spending more time in Lisbon and a weekend in Porto, it’s easy to see why Portugal belongs on all of those lists.
Lisbon is the most colorful city that I’ve ever been in. From the purple jacaranda trees to the colorful buildings decorated with brightly colored paint/tile/street art to the rainbow-like sunsets, there’s a ton of things to stare at. I mean, there are even peacocks everywhere.
The vibes from the people in Lisbon have been really incredible. People are friendly, speak good English, and are extremely social.
One of my favorite things so far has been seeing the big groups of people organically congregate around sunset at this spot called Santa Catarina which has an incredible view of the city. Every night people go there to have some drinks, play random instruments, and even sing. It’s a lot of fun to be around.
One of the best parts about moving from place to place every month is the opportunity that each new month gives you to hit the reset button. A lot of people, including myself, were feeling a little doughy leaving Prague because of all the bread, potatoes, and beer that we consumed. Before leaving Prague, our Program Leader, Mama Jen, proposed that mayyyybee this month we put some focus on getting kai-razy fit. Everyone nodded in agreement (and shame) as they took another sip from their Pilsner.
Lisbon has been the perfect place to hit the reset button with the awesome gym that we are all going to, the hills (oh, sweet Jesus, the hills…), the surfing lessons, and the lighter food and beverages.
I’m excited for this month because as a group we are focusing more and more on setting our goals for the year and supporting each other in achieving them. Looking back during the Pre-RY days, I wish I spent more time planning on how to get what I want out of this year and less time on what size of GoToobs I should get (“…but the 2oz ones have the little suction cup thingys and the 3oz don’t!” ← a real internal struggle for me *face palm*).
Also, next month Valentina and I will be going to a weekend retreat that brings together Remotes from different programs for sessions about creating change and developing new habits. Really excited about this.
Fortuitous timing gave us the opportunity to use Remote Year’s newest work space, which just opened last month. It’s got a similar feel to the WiP workspace we had in Split, but it’s different enough to make it feel like its own unique place.
Most importantly, it’s got a quiet room that is reminiscent of the quiet room (called “the library”) that I basically lived in at in the office back in Austin.

One of the things that everyone tells you when you talk about having babies is “no more travelling!”. I’ve always challenged this assumption and thought (and said) “Why? It must be slightly more challenging, but some people do it”. “Oh, you have no idea”.
I would then kind of give up and wouldn’t challenge it too much as I didn’t have babies, so if this was true, I would only understand it once I had them.
And then I had a baby. As we are Portuguese we had to plan our first holidays to visit the family in Portugal, and that meant travelling.
So we planned our first trip to Portugal. By car. From London to Lisbon. With a 3 months old.
Our friends with babies said “You’re crazy! You have no idea what you’re getting into!”. And once again we thought “What’s the big deal?”. But we had never travelled with Dinis so if it was that hard, we would only understand it once we travelled. And so we did.
Our first and most difficult trip was on August 2018 when Dinis was 3 months old. Because we wanted to spend a month in Portugal and we have Mia (our black Labrador) we decided to drive, so she could come with us (I know #crazy).
Was it cheaper than flights and leaving Mia with a dogsitter? Not really. But it was more about having her with us for all that time to be honest. A month is a long time to leave her behind. Was it easy? Nop. Did we survive? Yes. Both on the way to Lisbon and back.
Driving to Portugal from London nonstop takes 21h26 min (according to Google Maps).
We had already done it when we went to Portugal to get married and we took two days (about 12h drive each day). But with Dinis we left London, drove down to France, through to Spain and arrived in Portugal 5 days later (one of the days was a stay-over at my brother’s in France). So a 4 day drive. Double the time we had done before. And why? Well, let me explain.
There’s a few challenges when travelling with a baby in a car.
First, you need to stop every two hours. Babies shouldn’t stay in the car seat for longer than that until they’re 6 months due to risks of suffocation. So João planned a 6 hour of drive per day, with a stop every two hours. So ideally, we would spend about 8 hours a day travelling to a new destination with minimum stops included.
But our drives took about 12 hours each day. And why? Because you should only stop every 2 hours for safety purposes, but a baby has a mind of their own. They’re hungry, they pee, they poop and most of all they get bored and cry about it. Especially when they’re not used to being in a car that often (which is our case, we don’t own a car in London).
So that’s the hardest bit, you need to stop often and irregularly. You also need to be patient and either teach your baby to self soothe to sleep before you travel, during your travel or stop every single time your baby is upset or needs to sleep.
I’m not going to lie, he did get very upset a few times during our travels and at times where we couldn’t stop straight away as we’d miss the exit for a resting area. But the truth is they are not hurting, so you just need to try and calm them down with other distractions until you’re able to make the stop.
With the following travels (by plane), one thing I’ve noticed, is that breastfeeding is great for airplanes but not that great for cars. In a moving car, it’s not safe to take the baby out of the seat and hold them in the car. Should an accident happen (as we all know, these are unpredictable) and the chances of survival drop drastically.
For breastfeeding to work we, we need to feed the babies on demand. So sometimes they might sleep for 2 hours nonstop and have to be waken up, sometimes they feed every 30 min.
That’s when formula (or expressing if you’re good at it and have the patience for it) is a great help. You just need fresh boiled water in a flask, some prepared formula doses, bottles and you’re good to go!
This depends on the babies. Some babies are extremely sensitive to dirty nappies in the first months and will complain about it straight away. Dinis was like that. I understand! It must be just slightly uncomfortable to be sitting in your own pee or poop. Most rest stops will have toilets with changing tables for you to change your baby.
But when they don’t you quickly learn to improvise. I changed Dinis on grass, on a table and a lot of times on my lap whilst sitting in the car. It’s not very easy, and it depends on the size of your baby (I struggled more on the way back to London as he had grown during that month), but it’s doable.
Naps are a bliss. When they happen. I’m sooo glad decided to try and fix Dinis’ sleep before we travelled.
I believe a baby that doesn’t know how to, needs to be taught to sleep. Is it easier said than done? Hell yeah! Can it be done? Hell yeah.
From week 3, Dinis stopped sleeping properly during the day, giving me good nights, but terrible days. I couldn’t do anything. He wouldn’t even like being in the sling for too long as it was a very hot summer in London last year. So, two weeks before travelling and after 2 months of sleep struggle, we had enough and had to do something about it.
I don’t like the Ferber method (leaving your kid to cry on his own), I find it too harsh and I honestly think it wouldn’t work on Dinis (he’s a stubborn one), so I used the Tracy Hogg method (her book is on my Approved tab under the “Mum Books tab”) and we fixed Dinis’ naps during the day whilst his sleep pattern remained unchanged. From barely any sleep during the day, only sleeping on my chest we got to 3 naps a day (one of them a 2 hours nap). And him being able to get to sleep with no “boob aid” was what helped soooo much during our trip. Not that I didn’t breastfed him to sleep a few times. But at least half the time he would go to sleep on his own whilst we were on route with minimal fuss.
Should you have no time to read anything else past this (I know how motherhood works) my top tip for travelling with a baby is the following: Just go.
As with a lot of things in life, the thought of travelling with our baby is scarier and way more difficult than actually travelling with our baby. Because once you’re on route, it’s actually fine. So just grab your baby, and go. Well, prepare a little of course. But don’t let the thought of it stop you from going.
Because we’re two Portuguese living in London, if we want to see our family we need to travel. And since Dinis was born, we made 3 trips to Portugal and went to Prague on holidays. So that “impossible to travel once you have a baby” is nonsense to me. You’re a bit more limited money wise, you need to plan a bit more, but otherwise it’s all good. You just need to be a bit more flexible about your normal routine and not worry about how that will permanently affect your baby: it will not. Babies are sponges, they absorb what’s around them and they will change quickly and more effectively than we adults do. They just go with the flow.
Was this an easy trip? Not really. But would we do this again? Yes, we would. If anything it made us feel brave and made us not fear any other trip we will do with him.
So that’s it. Do it. You and your baby will be fine. And he might not remember much of it, but he will love it and you will have the best memories of it.
Hug, Millia

The ultimate guide to discover Portugal´s hidden gems

Portugal’s capital is having a moment and Americans are taking notice. Lisbon has planted itself on the radar of wealthy U.S. property buyers, drawn in by the city’s charm, affordability, and a rental market that’s too good to pass up. This year alone, at Goldcrest Buyers Agency we had a surge of over 15% on enquiries from US citizens — and I will explain why Lisbon is such an attractive destination for real estate investors.
Particularly for American investors, Lisbon offers the best of both worlds, a charming, laidback lifestyle at a fraction of the living costs as back home, and a favorable property investment scene.
Recently ranked as the sixth most profitable European city for property rentals by Global Property Guide, it’s outshining traditionally popular spots like Paris, Berlin and London. Rental yields in Lisbon averaged 5.65% by mid-2024, a number that’s been steadily climbing thanks to a strong demand from tenants and comparatively lower property prices.
For Americans, especially those used to high costs of cities like New York or San Francisco, Lisbon feels more attainable. High demand, fewer regulatory headaches than other European cities, and a booming tourism industry mean landlords can see real profits. Compared to places like Berlin or Paris, where acquisition costs are steep and rental rules are tight, Lisbon feels more accessible.
Why are Americans moving to Portugal?
Portugal has been quietly climbing the ranks as a destination for Americans looking to relocate, and the momentum is unmistakable. Google searches about “how to move to Portugal” increased by +1100% since 5 November 2024, with more Americans considering relocation than ever before.
This isn’t just a fad. Between January and June of this year, over a million U.S. tourists visited Portugal — a 15% jump from 2023. Meanwhile, the number of Americans living in Portugal grew by 44% last year, reaching over 14,000 by mid-2024. Many are drawn by the promise of a more affordable, slower-paced life.
And for Californians in particular, Portugal feels familiar. The weather is sunny, the coastline is stunning, and the lifestyle is relaxed. But unlike California, Portugal’s cost of living doesn’t break the bank.
Lisbon’s appeal for property investors
Lisbon is more than just a great place to live; it’s a smart place to invest. Tourism is booming, and short-term rental platforms have made it easy for property owners to turn their homes into income-generating assets. That said, this growth hasn’t come without challenges. The demand for rentals has pushed up prices, inciting debate about housing affordability for locals.
Despite this, property experts predict that Lisbon will remain a favorite for investors. Its location, climate, and quality of life make it instant draws for those looking to move abroad. The key for the future will be finding a balance between attracting investors and ensuring affordable housing for everyone.

I was lucky enough to get back to Lisbon (Lisboa) recently. I can’t get enough of the city, especially in the off season when it’s not overrun with tourists and global nomads looking for a tasty caipirinha or port in Bairro Alto and an evening of Fado in Alfama. I return to Lisboa for both too, but I also visit to ride the Metro and the trams and consider how a hilly city reminiscent of San Francisco gets people around.
As in Madrid and other European capitals, my transit envy for Lisbon always starts with the Metropolitano (Metro) de Lisboa right outside the airport terminals, as it should be.
The ease and comfort of riding the Metro with its cork appointed seats, comes in
contrast to my slog to JFK on an often old A train from Harlem to Lefferts and Liberty, followed by the Q10 Bus to the AirTrain.
Sure, I know I can save a few minutes by taking the A to Howard Beach or the E or LIRR to Jamaica and getting on the AirTrain ($8.25), but why would I? I’d rather budget more time for the trip and buy a couple of Trinidadan doubles for dinner with the money I save making my ride a single fare OMNY trip.
It is rare to get jostled on the Metro in Lisboa the way one might in New York. And getting on and off a crowded train is not the hassle it can be at rush hour on the A or E, or any of our trains for that matter.
Lisboa isn’t a massive city like New York or Los Angeles but like so many global cities I have gotten to know over the years, it seems to have figured out how to match its transit with its commuters’ needs and the city’s often steep topography. Take the romantic trams (amarelos da Carris) that climb up and down Lisboa’s narrow, winding streets. As with the New Orleans streetcars, San Francisco’s cable cars and L.A’s Angels Flight, one doesn’t have to be a transit lover to swoon over these trams.
Of course the Lisboa Metro and the trams aren’t perfect or service as frequent on some lines as it needs to be. One night, heading back to my Airbnb in Arroios, I couldn’t help noticing how packed the train was. Like sardines, as we used to say in New York, or sardinhas, in Lisboa.
The system is also not as disability accessible as it needs to be.
Still, Lisboa and Portugal in general seem years ahead of the U.S. in building a more sustainable transportation network that won’t cost the country the arm and a leg that the Second Avenue Subway extension is going to cost us.
And transit in Lisboa is still improving and growing. The new loop to Campo de Ourique will bring trains to more Lisboetas or Alfacinhas (little lettuces) as Lisboa residents are called.
The dedication to transit is consistent with the country and the E.U.’s commitment to sustainability generally. Portuguese cities are places where residents routinely sort their trash and recycling and best of all, drink their coffee at home or in a café, rather than out of a togo cup.
It was great to get back to Lisboa and it won’t be my last time riding the Metro. And while I am still learning the meaning of saudade, the Portuguese feeling of longing, melancholy, or nostalgia that is supposedly characteristic of the Portuguese temperament, who doesn’t love an airport with bike parking!
Yours in transit,
Joel

I understand in some places of the world, having a car is a must for getting around. Although Lisbon doesn’t fall into that category.
And since I see many people asking if they should rent a car when coming here. I felt like writing this.
So…
Is it worth renting a car when visiting Lisbon?
To honestly answer this question it’s better if you understand a few things beforehand.
Let’s start with the basics.
Why do you need a car?
Are you used to having one available at all times, and you see it as a luxury you can’t let go of? Is there a genuine necessity?
Which area of the city are you staying in, and how do you plan to utilize the car?
For how long will you be in Lisbon? What about Portugal in general?

One month in Lisbon. That’s some 90 meals. Quite a few I prepared at home. What is remarkable is how cheap fruit, vegetables, meat and fish are in Lisbon compared with Australia. Peppers and onions are sweet and cost pennies.
Tuna and Swordfish are about €12-€13 a kilo. It’s a shock to the system.
With cheaper ingredients, property and labour costs it is understandable that Portugal has plenty of quite cheap eats. I say quite cheap as Lisbon isn’t as cheap as you’d expect.
It’s partly that tax is high — 23% compared to Australia’s 10%. And partly that in the inner suburbs around the old town venues are mainly catering to tourists.
Restaurante Ponto Final
R. Ginjal 72, 2800 Almada
I’d rate this as one of the most essential Lisbon experiences together with its rooftop bars. I was recommended it by my old blogging friend Gill. And boy was it good, rustic, generous local dishes in a superb location.
We went for deep fried fish (of some sardine variation), a big bowl of beans with a fishcake -one pot could feed at least two — and a variety of other snacks and wine.
It’s a short ferry hop from Cais do Sodré to Cacilhas and then a 1km walk along a mostly abandoned and graffitied wharf to the restaurant. My only regret is that we didn’t return here.
Open daily 10am-12am
Av. 24 de Julho 49, Portugal Mainly catering to tourists, the Time Out Market is open all day every day and is worth visiting on Sunday and Monday nights in particular when many other restaurants are closed. It has a curated section of high profile local chefs with some stalls doing great value menu do dia.
You can try traditional local dishes such as prego rolls (steak sandwiches, braised ox cheek, bacaloa, pulvo (octopus) and croquetas at the various stalls. You can buy the amazing local Portuguese cheeses, ham, tinned goods, custard tarts and pastries. There’s also sushi, pizza, ice cream.
Seating probably 1,000 people it is a huge space with a really lively buzz. If you can’t decide what to eat, Time Out market will be no help because it will present you with so many choices.
There is a market next door with greengrocers, fish mongers and butchers.
Mon — Thu 10:00–23:00, Fri — Sun 10:00–01:00
106, R. Coelho da Rocha 104, Lisboa
This mercado is the Prahran Market of Lisbon though the focus is more about eating than shopping. It’s got plenty of steak and burger bars. In addition to others doing fish, ceviche and more. It’s a bit more pricy than the Time Out market and has less choice. It’s still fun though.
Saturday mornings
Jardim do Príncipe Real This is the local farmers market. You can buy wine, sensational cheese, ham and fruit and veg. I bought an amazing local bread, heavy enough to sink a blogger. There are also a selection of food stalls where you can eat. It’s worth a Saturday morning stroll here and a coffee at the local kiosk.
R. Dom Pedro V 129, 1250–096 Lisboa
I’ve already said it’s worth stopping for a large G&T or a pisco sour here. It’s also one of the hottest restaurants in town with terrific local variations on ceviche. Arrive early or make a booking.
NB: Don’t order the NZ sauvignon blanc!
R. António Maria Cardoso 58, 1200–330 Lisboa
At first I thought I’d jumped back a decade at Mini Bar as a Ferran Adria Spherified Olive (2004) was delivered. But perhaps that was just my food nerdiness. The food and drink is good and is a diversion from the traditional rustic fare. The menu took us through an excellent selection of curated wines and tapas-style dishes with Japanese influences. There was tiny ice cream cone with sashimi; a single ceviche of prawn served on a lime that you bite into; chicken skin tapas; tuna tataki. Overall this was one of the best dining experiences in Lisbon. Owner José Avillez — a local has other Lisbon restaurants all nearby — Belcanto, Cantinho do Avillez, Café Lisboa, and Pizzaria Lisboa.
R. Duques de Bragança 5, Lisboa
The crust is thin…really thin on these pricy pizzas.
Rua de O Século 242, Lisboa
Recommended by our Airbnb host, Tascardo is very local and great value. I had the steak in a garlic sauce with a fried egg on top. Pam was surprised that the squid came complete with innards and beak. It’s tasty and rustic — as is most Portuguese food.
R. Nova do Almada 95, 1200–288 Lisboa Eventually you will crave vegetables. I mean back home do you only eat meat, fish and potatoes? No. This place, off Lisbon’s main shopping strip, does healthy salads. Top up on vegetables here.
Portugal, R. das Portas de Santo Antão 136, 1150–265 Lisboa  A grungy cafe doing Australian-style coffee and food. Worth a diversion.
Bengal Tandoori Lisboa
Rua da Alegria 23, Lisbon 1250–005
Curry in Lisbon? Why not. After all the Portuguese introduced chillis to India and led to the invention of vindaloo, a sour, hot curry containing pork. From savoury (and sweet for dessert) samosas to vindaloo this is a serious curry shop. You’ll need to navigate windy narrow back streets past a few rowdy African bars.
LX Factory
R. Rodrigues de Faria 103, 1300 Lisboa
Mainly burger joints and interesting reclaimed industrial buildings with various boutiques.

In November of 2017, I attended the Launch in Lisbon program and WebSummit. By the end of that trip, at a stylish and endearingly gritty aftertparty at the Hub Criativo Beato, I declared that I would be moving to Lisbon.
Now that I live here, people often ask why I picked Lisbon instead of a more obvious tech hub. It’s not a simple answer, and I get asked this question enough times that I decided to write this article about it:
I first visited Lisbon in the Spring of 2017 when I was attending several startup events across the EU, including cities such as London, Berlin, Milan, and Zurich. Lisbon was actually my stopover on the way to London; I had eight hours and one local friend to show me a preview of the city. We walked through some of the city’s many scenic areas and had lunch overlooking the river and the 25 de Abril Bridge on a bright sunny day — Lisbon is known for its unique light, among other things. With my extra time I wandered the streets and had a casual meeting at Startup Lisboa to talk about their incubator program. There was something relaxed, warm and inviting about that meeting that left an impression on me as I left to visit other European cities.
In the US there was ongoing political tension and a degradation of values such as Net Neutrality (a free and open internet) and data privacy. I realized that launching a startup in the streaming video space would be more challenging and prone to failure in an already risky field. After researching the major European tech hubs, making several spreadsheets, and visiting startup community events, I was still not sure where it would make sense to base myself out of. So after considering the logical factors, I let all of that go and instead tuned into how I felt physically and emotionally in each city. The memories of the first hours in Lisbon kept appearing, and that was enough to justify the fateful trip where I made the decision.
Lisbon wants foreigners to come and build their companies here. They see new technology startups and even new companies with traditional business models as a way to grow their economy, and they are investing in that.
Lisbon offers a combination of loans and grants through its Portugal 2020 program, where you can receive 0% interest loans for almost half of your company’s initial operating costs without sacrificing any equity. There are also government-sponsored incubators such as Startup Lisboa (full disclosure: I am now in the Startup Lisboa program and a recipient of Portugal 2020 program so I’m totally biased), where you can have an adorable office in downtown Lisbon and mentorship services for a very small monthly cost. I used to have a discounted “hot desk” at a coworking space in New York and now, for the same price, I have an office that can fit four people with a view of a building with azulejos (those pretty tiles associated with Lisbon) and a small balcony where I can see the Tejo river.
The costs for administrative activities and employees is also lower compared to Western Europe and most of the US, but to be fair, I should point out that those costs will increase in the next few years as the Portuguese economy matures and more tech companies more here for “nearshoring” (yes, that’s a thing). Because of the lower operating costs, I am able to bootstrap for a longer period of time and achieve more milestones before giving away equity for investment
Portugal is a crossroads between Europe, the Americas and Africa, and the Lusophone (network of portuguese speaking countries) even extends to some parts of South and East Asia. Why does this matter? Aside from business reasons, it helps Lisbon and Portugal to break away from homogeneous thinking. The LGBT, creative, and entrepreneurial communities often intersect and result in social and cultural amenities that are usually reserved for larger cities.
Portugal’s legendary hospitality and diversity are also a factor that helps Portugal earn the ranking with of best quality of life for expats in the world and helps Lisbon consistently place in the Monocle annual Quality of Life survey. And in the startup scene itself, it lends to a more collaborative, supportive environment rather than a competitive mentality.
Maybe it’s because Portugal and the UK are in the same timezone and have had a peace treaty for over 600 years. It could also be because Portugal’s population is 10.3 million (somewhere between the populations of New Jersey and Pennsylvania) and they don’t expect the world to learn their language. Regardless of the reason, the Portuguese tend to speak really good English. The younger population and tech professionals are almost always fluent. Being a native English speaker is an advantage here, and learning basic Portuguese is sincerely appreciated, but not mandatory.
I’m surprised that the Portuguese speak English with an accent that often sounds more American than British. They tell me that it is because they don’t dub their films and they watch a lot of US TV shows on Netflix.
Also, I should note that many Portuguese people speak three or more languages — usually English, French, Spanish or German in addition to their native tongue. They do not have the same linguistic reputation as the Swiss, but I think they deserve this acknowledgment.
Launching a company in countries with larger populations and strong domestic economies can cause a company to think about only the local market. That doesn’t work very well for a tech startup with global ambitions. In Portugal’s case, they expect you to focus on external markets as soon as you can. And the government has an internationalization program with grants to help you market to other countries.
As I stated previously, Portugal is a crossroads, an international hub that connects to other global markets and cultures despite its relatively small size.
Lisbon is a startup hub that is not held back by old paradigms.
Berlin, London and Paris: they are wonderful places and have thriving startup scenes. But they all have a preconceived notion and a reputation that is hard to change. Lisbon doesn’t have this burden; Lisbon is creating something new, experimenting and evolving as it discovers its niche. The creative class and digital nomads often come from interesting and wealthy countries and choose to move to Lisbon after seeing many parts of the world.
I’ve heard that Portugal is described as the “New California” and Lisbon is the new San Francisco of Europe. I don’t know if I agree with that assessment but I do imagine that Lisbon has the potential to be a futuristic Starfleet Headquarters-type place. A center of innovation, creativity and a place that embodies the human rights and data policies that were outlined in the Treaty of Lisbon. And I think Lisbon has a strong chance of being associated with new media.
Like many startup founders, I might be extra optimistic and biased. I might fail and Lisbon might not reach its potential. But there is a spirit here that continuously encourages me to embrace Lisbon, and Lisbon has already displayed its ongoing level of commitment to me.
Michael Fiorentino is the Founder of Vixtape, which is building a streaming TV service that combines audio, video and data in new ways. He will have a booth at WebSummit and will be VJing several unofficial night events that week in Barrio Alto, Principe Real and Marvila.

If you’re planning a summer holiday, why choose between city or beach? Come to sunny Lisbon and have both!
You find beaches for all tastes around Lisbon. Here’s your ultimate Lisbon beach guide to the main and easily accessible areas.
50 km northwest of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
This quaint fishing village became a Europe’s top surf spot and is one of the four World Surfing Reserves. Its best surf breaks include Ribeira d’Ilhas, Coxos and Pedra Branca. Its Atlantic coastline has a handful of unspoiled beaches great to relax and spend some family time, like Foz do Lizandro and São Lourenço. During the summer, it comes alive with locals and tourists and there’s no shortage of beach accommodation, surf schools and lodges, nightlife spots and seafood restaurants.
30 km northwest of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
This UNESCO site town is widely known for its dream-like palaces. However, north of town and included in a protected area, near picturesque villages with local restaurants serving delicious food you find beaches loved for their wilderness and natural beauty. Adraga, Grande and Maçãs are amongst the best beaches near Sintra.
30 km west of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
In the Portuguese Riviera more than ten Blue Flag beaches have something for everyone — family fun, water sports and great spots for surfing and sports alike. Tamariz and Carcavelos are some of the best-known, and there’s the wild Guincho, a world’s top windsurf location. There are hip surf hostels and schools galore, Europe’s biggest casino, top-class beach hotels and golf resorts. These are the beaches most easily accessible from Lisbon and can get busy during the summer.
15 km south of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
Portugal’s longest strip of sand spreads over 30 km with beaches facing the Atlantic fresh waters. Apart from endless space for sunbathing, you find a variety of watersports including surfing, kitesurfing, windsurfing and scuba-diving, as well as schools and hostels. Affordable seafood, lively beach bars and summer parties complete the scenery for a fantastic sunny time with sand between your toes. During the summer, a small train takes you along 10 km of beaches. As for the other 20 km, car is the best option. The further south you go, the wilder it gets and the fewer people you find. It’s also home to one of the earliest nudist beaches around the capital — Meco.
40 km south of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports
This picturesque fishing town is home to long strips of sand facing calm waters. It’s a popular amongst locals, mainly families attracted by the quiet waters of the sheltered bays. Although it became a popular summer resort known for it beach hotels and fresh seafood restaurants, it retains its fishing atmosphere — you can still see the fishermen selling the day’s catch. Located at the mouth of the Sado River, the sea is rich in fish, being one of the best sport-fishing spots around Lisbon. Amongst its most sought after beaches are Califórnia and Ouro.
45 km south of Lisbon easily reached by car.
The scenery is something you’ll never forget about Arrábida’s beaches — the perfect combination of golden sand, green cliffs, and blue sea.
A natural park covering 108 km2 is home to peaceful sandy coves. Its calm blue waters and the diversity of marine life make it one of the best spots for snorkelling and scuba-diving in Portugal. Its sea caves are also an opportunity for those who enjoy caving and diving. Portinho da Arrábida and Figueirinha are its most famous beaches. If you’re a seafood fan, there are excellent and affordable restaurants.
55km south of Lisbon easily reached by car/ferryboat
This peninsula inspires anyone with its magnificent landscape, formed by the Arrábida green mountains, the Sado estuary and miles of unspoiled dunes. Its long beaches and the calm transparent waters are ideal for families, like the Tróia-mar beach. For a break from the sand, there are tours to watch dolphins playing in the sea, watersports and beachfront resorts with tennis courts and golf courses. A casino and superb seafood restaurants complete the picture, making it a top-notch beach destination. Just count with prices above the average.
70km south of Lisbon easily reached by car/ferryboat
In the small village of Comporta things are as simple as long swathes of sand and calm waters sheltered by dunes and pinewoods. In a protected area that impresses by its natural beauty and wildlife, you find a beach that goes by the same name with everything for a tranquil summer holiday and an invigorating contact with nature. There are golf courses and excellent conditions for bird watching, or you can just take a seaside stroll or hop on a horse for a different view of the sands. You can choose from affordable places to eco-friendly villas and house retreats with a touch of luxury. One thing is sure — compared with Tróia it’s much natural and quieter.

Even before the pandemic, many people, particularly US citizens, have been looking to move somewhere that offered a better quality of life. One of the main criteria is it must be safe, and on the surface Portugal appears to be a good option. Nobody gets killed at school by rampaging gunmen, the country isn’t always at war, or threatening war, and most people aren’t openly aggressive towards people of colour. So, what’s to worry about?
The question of how we learn about the practicalities of immigrating to a new country critically depends on the scope of your enquiries. How deep do you go and how do you rate the sources you use to draw conclusions? My husband and I, both sociologists and writers, lived in Lisbon for three and a half years. We had travelled there several times before and already had a few Portuguese friends before we decided to move. We didn’t speak much Portuguese but it wasn’t our first time starting life in a new country where we didn’t speak the language. We did everything ourselves, there was no relocation agent, and we knew obtaining accommodation, dealing with bureaucracy and getting settled would require patience and a lot of energy. Even having a relocation agent doesn’t count for much, because once you’re settled, the problems don’t end there.

On my request, my VA compiled a list of museums in and around Lisbon for me. The Museu de Marinha (in Belem) is free on the 1st Sunday of every month (which today, Oct 1, happens to be) so I decided to check it out. I did pay the extra for the temporary exhibition Vikings although it wasn’t as educational or even as entertaining as I expected it to be so I don’t recommend it. In fact, if you have a Netflix subscription, watch the series Vikings (its gruesome and probably inaccurate but definitely entertaining)
As for the Museu de Marinha itself, I highly recommend it. Here are some of my random thoughts and photographs of the visit.
The entrance itself is impressive with a tall ceiling of many (probably unnecessary) arches. Beneath it sits a statue of Prince Henry (Infante D. Henrique) who is credited with launching the Age of Discoveries for Portugal.
There’s also a giant map behind him of the Portuguese exploration. Naturally, I was curious about their conquest of Goa so I zoomed in for a closer look.
According the the map, there’s a route taken by Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500 from Portugal to Brazil, then past the Cape of Good Hope onwards to the East Coast of Africa and finally Goa. Vasco da Gama it seems, went straight to Cochin. Some day soon I will research more about these sea routes.
The museum has a large variety of ship models progressing from charming early 14th century merchant ships all the way to the less-impressive 21st century destroyer ships and submarines.
It was a bit disappointing to see the transition of ships as vessels of exploration and commerce into vessels of war over the years.
I did however find a small label in the exhibit that mentioned the “myth” of the School of Sagres.
Since I had never heard of this School before, I believe the myth even more now.
(hint: This could be the start of a great Dan Brown novel)
If you like Museums and you’re in/around Lisbon, here’s the map i referred to earlier with information about free days and museum timings. Feel free to use and share.
Also, completely irrelevant yet important — if you have a problem remembering and managing your passwords for your 50+ online accounts, here’s a solution that I’ve been using for over 3 years now and can’t live without. It’s called Dashlane and if you use my referral link here you will get $20 off your Premium subscription (there’s also a free version)

Kanazawa opens everyday for dinner. On a good day, it sits eight customers. On a bad day too. How a tiny restaurant with pricey menus, slow service and a strict reservation policy is challenging its industry’s dogmas.
Tomoaki Kanazawa started cooking in 1985. In 1993 he was invited by the Japanese Ambassador in Portugal to come to Lisbon as the Embassy Chef. Years later he opened his own restaurant, Tomo, that would become a reference in traditional Japanese cuisine in Lisbon.
However, Tomoaki wasn’t happy. He believed that when customers visited his restaurant they should feel as if they were eating at someone’s home but, because he was serving over 100 meals at lunch and dinner, he couldn’t spare a minute to be with them, so he couldn’t provide them with that kind of experience. So he took a bold step: he left Tomo to his employees and, together with his wife Kayo and his daughter Sakura, he opened Kanazawa, the 8 seat restaurant that set up a whole new standard for high end cuisine in Lisbon and may well become a business case study.
1. You can make customers work for your product
Kanazawa’s first management lesson is that you don’t need to make your customers’ lives easy, what you need is to have a product they want so badly they will work hard to get.
The waiting list is months-long. When I was there in November, I overheard a fellow customer saying that he was trying to make a reservation since August. Not only that, but the booking experience is in itself a challenge. You can’t book a table over the phone, the reservations are to be made online. After providing your contact information, you must select three alternative dates for your visit. Then, you have to confirm that you agree with the cancellation policy, which states that, if you cancel your reservation in the 3 day-period prior to the confirmed date, you will pay a cancellation fee, which starts at 60% of the price of the menu if you cancel 3 days before and rises up to 100% if you cancel on the same day. After confirming your agreement, your credit card number is requested, which is to ensure that, if you actually decide to cancel within that 3-day period, the fee is credited from your account.
Finally, you must choose one of the four different menus, prices ranging from 60€ to 150€. It is almost impossible to grasp the differences between the menus, as the dishes names are in Japanese and there are no pictures to illustrate them. Calling the restaurant won’t work either (I tried), as the language barrier is there too. My very simple solution for this complex problem was to google every dish on each menu, go over the available pictures, and create a global understanding of what to expect.
This extenuating process sends a strong message to the customer: The restaurant is opening for eight people only, and you are one of them. From the moment we accept your reservation, we are deeply committed to provide you with the best experience we can create. Make sure to honor your commitment too. It might sound harsh, but it is easy to understand if you refer back to Tomoaki’s vision: when you visit his restaurant you should feel as if you were eating at his home. So think about it, if you were invited to an 8-guest dinner party at a friend’s place and he was counting on you to bring the wine, would you lightly cancel on the same day?
2. You can invest time on your customers
Kanazawa’s second management lesson is that time spent preparing and delivering a personalized experience to your customers is never — ever — wasted.
When I arrived at Kanazawa, Kayo took my coat and showed me where I was supposed to sit. While I was seating I was stunned to notice that there was a small, handwritten name tag with my name on it, right next to a line-up of the courses, also handwritten, with that day’s date on it. It is a small gesture that immediately makes you feel special and welcome. Someone took the time to write this for me, I thought.
The eight seats are placed around the sushi bar. Tomoaki served the first course, calmly explaining what it was, where the ingredients came from (more on that in a second), and how to taste it. The ritual is repeated every time a new course is served. Even though he alternates between groups of customers, he is able to make each group feel unique, as if he was there just for them.
At Kanazawa desserts are cooked by Kayo, so she takes over when the time comes to serve and explain them. She goes individually to each group and speaks in a really soft, delicate manner, that somehow makes you feel all the careful dedication that was put into each of the tiny portions of cake, mousse and ice-cream, all made from local ingredients. She then brings in a small portion of handmade candy, served in a mirrored-plate and accompanied by the tiniest origami I’ve ever seen (someone did this for me, I thought). Before leaving, you still get a package of homemade cookies to take home.
The whole service is perfectly adapted to the rhythm of each group, as if someone was keeping an attentive eye to make sure that you would neither be rushed nor have to wait too long. This probably has something to do with the fact that Tomoaki designed the whole experience based on the Japanese tea ceremony inspired by Sen no Rikyu. I arrived at Kanazawa at 8.30pm and left at 11.30pm, feeling that it was still 9.30pm, just like would have happened if I was having dinner at some old friend’s place. Tomoaki and his family spent 3 hours of their evening with me. And I can’t wait to go back.
3. You can work with your family
Kanazawa’s third management lesson is that working with your family doesn’t have to be a tense experience for all of those involved — it can actually be quite peaceful.
If you’ve ever watched or read about Netflix’s Chef’s Table, you know that family plays a big part in Chefs’ careers. Families can either be the solid foundation or the constant source of pressure, questioning, and regret for great Chefs around the world.
Kanazawa employs three people, and they are all related. You might expect that this simple fact could in itself result in a not so simple work dynamics, but that is not the case — at all. In fact, all the processes and rituals are so well coordinated among Tomoaki, Kayo and Sakura that you barely hear them speak to each other. Or get into each other’s space. Sakura mostly helps her father in the kitchen, but she doesn’t need to be told what to do. She just knows the rhythm and plays according to it. She moves graciously at precise moments. Kayo works her way around customers, picking up finished courses, delivering new tableware, serving tea, so discretely that you can barely hear her steps. It’s almost as if they are dancing a secret family dance. You don’t know the moves but it is just beautiful to watch.
Their working choreography not only looks peaceful from the outside, it actually makes you feel calm and relaxed, as when you visit a couple of friends at their place and they naturally take turns going to the kitchen to prepare the meal, just to make sure that you are not left alone in the living room. One of them is always keeping you company. That’s how you feel at Kanazawa too.
4. You can buy from local vendors
Kanazawa’s fourth management lesson is that it is possible to run a successful business making it a principle to buy from small local vendors.
Tomoaki not only selects Portuguese fish for his restaurant, he makes sure that each species’ origin is well-known to the customers. One of the highest moments of the dining experience comes when he opens up a wood box containing different fish species, perfectly cut and prepared, and talks in great detail about the provenience and seasonality of each of them, so that the customer can make a well informed choice about the nigiris he should prepare. Most of the vegetables and fruits used have Portuguese roots too. What his suppliers have in common, beyond the nationality, is the compromise towards sustainable production.
This is one direct consequence of Kanazawa’s very unique operating model. Working in a 100-seat restaurant means preparing food three or four days in advance. You don’t actually know how many people will come (even those who made a reservation can cancel or simply don’t show up) and what they will eat, so you need to have a huge stock in place and proceed with as much setting up as possible. Tomoaki, on the other hand, not only has eight customers per night, but he also knows beforehand what they will be eating and he can be quite sure that they will come. So he can focus on preparing the best — not the cheapest nor the fastest — meal his customers can have, and he can buy fresh ingredients and source them locally.
Isn’t that what anyone who has guests over does? Buying ingredients from a market or supermarket that is trustworthy and close to home and preparing the meal just before the guests arrive? If you’ve ever been in the host position, you know how good it feels to look for and cook the best ingredients you can find. But as a guest, you also know how good it feels to have a simple but thoughtful meal put together just for you. And this is where Tomoaki’s brilliance reveals itself once again: you feel that, by putting all this focus in looking for the best ingredients, he is concerned with putting a thoughtful meal together for you.
All in all, Kanazawa’s main take-away lesson for business is this: if you have a strong vision for your product, invest your time on crafting and delivering a personalized experience for your customers, create a safe and calm working environment, and stay true to your principles, you can focus on what really matters, which is to turn your work into a permanent state of passion.

Lisbon… I have arrived to this wonderful city two years ago and fell in love with it at the first glance. Lisbon was like my beloved man, like my lover and my soulmate who was waiting for me for all his life, waiting patiently for me to come. I remember that wonderful day in April 2013, I remember that moment when the plane was about to land and my knees started to shiver….. I had a strange feeling that I am coming home but not going for a vacation to an amazing country with a very old and rich history. And I guess I was right…… because 2 years later (as I was coming back over and over again to see my beloved Lisbon) I have relocated here.
I love this city and this amazing country for its marvellous landscapes, incredible beaches, breath-taking nature, magnificent sunsets and wonderful sky. Yes, sky. If you have travelled a lot I bet you noticed that sky and clouds in every country are different. But if you have been to Portugal at least once you will never forget its sky, because you will not be able to find something like that in any other place. I would like to share with you my impressions and experience from the places I have visited in Portugal, about the beauty of this country, its history, its architecture and its magnificent charisma, yes charisma because Portugal for me is not just a country, it is like a lifetime partner who is always happy with you, for you and feels saudade (beautiful juicy Portuguese word which actually has no direct translation but describes a deep emotional state of nostalgia for something or someone you really love, e.g. your motherland or beloved person, something important and significant) when you leave it.
For many years it was a forgotten city. It endured a very long dictatorship; and later it accumulated errors of urban planning. :) Nowadays Lisbon is a city with an odd geography comprising different villages, connected by a incomprehensible system of streets, alleys, lanes, travessas (small, narrow but very cosy streets) abandoned tram lines. Perhaps it is the city where it is impossible to make plans at all; because the city grabs you, hugs you and whispers to your ears lots of crazy ideas even if you have strict plans and you need to stick to them. You might have a walk downtown because you have an appointment there with a friend or a lesson of Portuguese language close to Rua Augusta but then… suddenly you just make a turn to the street you haven’t been before to grab a coffee and suddenly beauty of new unknown street devours you completely, you call your friend and ask to join you immediately or you give a call to language school to reschedule the lesson because now you have to explore the beauty you haven’t seen before. And this is a way much more important than studying. :)
Lisbon loves you a lot, you feel this love, you swim at it, and you feel it with your heart, your skin, your fingertips and your soul. Lisbon hugs you and whispers wonderful words to your ears, he sings fado (incredibly beautiful traditional music and songs in Lisbon, which refers to saudade as originally fado are songs about loss and missing something important) for you, he offers you amazing food, and you feel overwhelmed with this city. That is how I felt from the very first minute I have spent in Lisbon. If you come here once and stay for living you realise that in this city you live like the days were never-ending and Lisbon is a boyfriend who does not forgive your absence. Because today you need to be in Gulbenkian museum because the new exhebition is just starting, and at the same day there is a wonderful indie rock band performing in Bairro Alto, and tomorrow you need to wake up early because you have classes but you have no time to study at all because this city offers so many things every day. You need to go to that new restaurant of seafood which has just opened downtown, then your friend has a launch of a book, then you were thinking of going to Alfama and making some great photos, and finally your friend from Germany is calling and saying that she has a day off and you need to go to Carcavelos for surfing. And you have so many things to do, which you REALLY need to do and you have an early morning yoga class. BUT, You cannot resist this city and you are never tired of all the activities he offers you and you cannot refuse all this as you might offend him. But your love for it is so huge and you need to be there for this city all the time so you just flow with it and its rythm.

I arrived in Lisbon a little over one month ago to start my Erasmus semester abroad. I had previously not visited Lisbon but had heard incredible things, so when I arrived, I wanted to see it all for myself. I couldn’t wait to get out and get active making use of the last summer days in September/October. I found myself immersed by a city full of beautiful old buildings, cobbled streets (old streets of Alfama), viewpoints (Miradouro Santa Catarina, Nossa Senhora de Monte are two favourites) and rooftop bars at sunset (Park, Topo, LX), great contemporary art (Museu Coleção Berardo) not to mention the surfing (Costa de Caparica) and most importantly the incredible nightlife here (cheap drinks in Bairro, great electronic music at Lux and a festival called Brunch). But hands down the best aspect of Erasmus is the exposure to new people, new cultures, new languages and most importantly new food!
But, me being me…I just can’t seem to ignore my keen interest in startup’s and Lisbon’s thriving ecosystems makes it even harder to ignore. Once I got confirmation of my place here at NOVA , I quickly added Web Summit to the list of ‘must-dos’ whilst here. Building on my past work at Leade.rs and VivaTech earlier this year (check out my medium profile). I am very much looking forward to being part of their Live team covering social media for this momentous event — boy do we have a task. Previously based in Dublin — 2016 was the first year Lisbon hosted the event and what an event it was…attracting 53,000 people, 15,000 companies, 7,000 CEOs and 700 investors it became Europe’s largest tech conference, and it’s poised to grow in 2017. This all demonstrates that Lisbon is not only capable but eager and yearning to establish itself on the world stage as a leader in creativity, technology, and innovation.
Paddy Cosgrove Web Summit founder put it well…‘Lisbon is like Berlin five years ago, but with a southern European climate.’
Currently Lisbon is a rising star and an underdog — ranked by Allianz as the fifth-best-performing startup community in Europe, ahead of front-runners like Stockholm and Dublin. In fact, according to Preqin, the number of VC deals closed in Lisbon 2016 jumped sixfold from 2015, delivering it’s best year yet $18.5 million spread across 9 deals. But that is just the tip of the iceberg — the Portuguese have had to make do without swaths of international investment which countries like the UK and Germany have received and that has translated into making Lisbon one of the best locations to bootstrap a startup.
One of Portugal’s main attractions is the combination of low-cost of living and high quality of life, two things that are very rarely found in one of Europe’s capital cities. On top of that, the OECD considered it the 3rd easiest country to start a company. This makes it makes it cheaper and easier to build great products utilising their highly skilled and ubiquitous talent. Fun fact: Lisbon has the highest percentage of founders with Masters or Ph.D. a whopping 82%.
Their rich history also plays its part, their Age of Discovery inspires a sense of exploration and due to Portugal’s small size; it fosters an outwardly focused mindset. It’s this very mindset which makes startups here think ‘international from day one’ giving them access to a larger addressable market, vital to startup scalability. According to the 2017 Startup Genome Report, Portuguese startups have high proportion of customers from outside Europe. A great example being F*ck Marry Kill, the gamified dating app, was founded in Lisbon but also enjoys popularity in German markets too. Furthermore, another advantage is how widespread and well spoken English is here, EF reports English proficiency at 59.68%.
Picture yourself – considering all of the above whilst relaxing in the hot summer sun after a surf on a stunning beach; sipping a caipirinha and eating some freshly caught and perfectly cooked seafood —then you know how it feels to live in Portugal.
It’s international accessibility, low cost of living and enriching lifestyle is catching ever more attention of global talent and press. All of these factors coalesce to accelerate the momentum it has recently accumulated — but to become sustainable, the ecosystem needs founders to nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs by spreading their knowledge and expertise through mentorship and re-investment.
A vital channel for mentorship, funding and networking is incubators such as, Beta-i producing 40 startups and raising more than $166million. They have worked with over 500 startups and run various acceleration programs, including Beta-start and Lisbon Challenge which attract applicants from 60 countries.
Canopy City a social impact-focused coworking space and incubator.
Impact Hub part innovation lab, part business incubator, and part community center.
BET Ventures an events company aimed at empowering entrepreneur’s.
StartUP Lisboa a government body focused on scale-up innovation. Check out their #ThisisPortugal campaign below.
Talkdesk, joined 500 startups — received 21 million dollars of investment from Salesforce.Uniplaces, a disruptive force in the student accommodation industry that started in Lisbon and has spread to 30+ European cities — raised $24 million Series A last NovemberCLICK HERE for more.
In many ways Lisbon feels like Europe’s version of San Francisco — not to mention the look-a-like Golden Gate Bridge, tanned surfers, streetcars and hills (lucky no sharks though).
Sheffield’s Universities Portuguese partner and my host university, Nova School of Business and Economics is in the unique position of having a great interface with the Lisbon startup community due to their newly opened NOVA Venture Lab, running its flagship Zero Gravity incubator/accelerator programme designed to invest in and develop innovative startups both nationally and internationally.
This innovative mindset filters into their teaching here too. In particular one of the main driving forces behind this renewed perspective and practice is Miguel Munñoz Duarte my Entrepreneurship professor and CEO of iMatch an innovation, marketing and sales focused collaborative consultancy. He has great connections to the vibrant ecosystem here and often arranges guest speakers to shine some light on the practical workings of the methodologies and techniques that we learn. A great example of this was our first guest Christian Vismara — a product manager at Build-Up Labs who came to talk to our class about his role there and specifically his work on F*ck Marry Kill.
First off, Build Up Labs is a Lisbon based Startup Studio also known as a Venture Builder — they create startups from start to finish (wherever that may be). A Venture builder is an all in one ideation, building/development, and growth house. They leverage a lean process and a cross-disciplinary team using shared resources to grow successful businesses. Think of it as the diametric opposite of ‘all your eggs in one basket’ — instead their approach is ‘put lots of eggs in different basket and nurture them until they either fly or die.’
Recently parent Startup birdie (Build Up Labs) celebrated it’s first successful hatch and fly- in other words, their first exit with NVY.LIFE to L’Oreal, it’s a beauty and lifestyle club via blog/news/app — they help readers to realise the best versions of themselves. Check it out HERE.
Christian however, talked a little more about F*ck Marry Kill (FMK) — dubbed “Tinder of the university students” by Jornal de Notícias and as the name suggests, it’s not your standard dating service it’s a game that is designed not to be taking seriously and is best at making it more fun to meet new people. They are now attracting a growing and addicted user base in Portugal and Germany too. In total, they have 72,600 users and has already registered 1.2 million hits and more than 550,000 messages sent.
tapmyback — a peer-to-peer motivation and feedback tool for teams. ToyToy a kids toy product discovery app.CLICK HERE to check out their Portfolio.
“The only thing worse than starting something and failing…is not starting.” — Seth Godin
Startup is a game of failure and if you fail, you learn and if you learn, you succeed. At Build Up Labs they strongly head the words above. Un-afraid to talk about their past mistakes they view their failures as a portfolio of experience and after all, their motto is…
“Grow fast or kill fast”
The venture building model was new and interesting to me, so after the great talk Christian gave; I approached him to find out more…I was invited to visit their office in the up-and-coming industrial end of town, Marvilla which is located in a co-working space called The Hood — I was introduced to all the members of the team; Rui Gouveia CEO, João Duarte data scientist, João Pereira and Salvador Barros, I am really excited to help develop their social profile and produce an effective strategy.
CLICK HERE to find out more about the venture building model.
Finally, I have to say that I have never felt such a strong affinity to a city, let alone the one I luckily chose to study in. There is so much to do and see and it’s impossible to tire of it. A trip to Oporto is next on the agenda.

A. interested in startup/tech/innovation
B. going to web summit C. need a social media helping hand.

Welcome to a new edition of the Tales of Ink and Light. In this one, i flip through the pages of a classic photobook and find echoes of the poetry that attracted me to Lisbon.
A decisive factor in my decision to move to Lisboa was the poetic atmosphere that i had felt while walking up and down its streets during a few short-ish stays. Often when i leave the house, i am unexpectedly reminded of that impalpable yet intensely real thing that exudes from the city.
I find it hard to define (and there is also the fact that i’d be reluctant to name it with precision, even if it were possible). It may be the colours of the walls, it may be the light, it may be a smell, it may be certain clothes people wear, it may be the sounds, it may be attitudes or certain sentences, and the river is certainly a part of it. It is these small things that suddenly appear to incarnate the soul of the place and make you think — oh, yes, indeed, i’m here, this is it. It is the sort of inescapable feeling that seems impossible to describe and that you can only understand if you’ve experienced it personally time and time again.
‘Lisbon, you know…’ is a sentence i read in a poem that appears in Lisboa, cidade triste e alegre (‘Lisbon, sad and joyful city’), a photobook that started as a series of booklets sent to subscribers by post (at the time, it was a way to circumvent the censorship of the dictatorial regime) and later rose to fame after being prominently featured in Martin Parr and Gerry Badger’s History of the Photobook. A modern facsimile edition…

I’m just back from the WebSummit in Lisbon. I had never been to Lisbon before but I’ve heard that they have great trails. As much as I’m a technerd and the WebSummit is an massive tech party with endless happenings, there was no way they were going to keep me off the trails all the week! I’ve heard the call of the trails! I contacted WERIDE and booked a full day guided ride including rental bike, at the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, approximately 25km north-west of Lisbon. I knew that I was pushing it doing a full day Enduro ride after three days of late nights and many drinks..But,
to bike or not to bike — was not even the question..
I was picked up by Hugo, the owner of WERIDE who took me to Miguel, my guide for the day. My trail monster for the day was a YT Capra with an amazing Öhlins rear shock. A Swedish rear shock for a rare Swedish guy, now that’s how you roll!
After an espresso and a Pastel de nata at the little town of Arneiro, we started the fifty minute non-stop climb up to the trailhead. It was raining and humid but the air was fresh and the surrounding forrest was green and lush. I had asked for Enduro, and enduro is what I got. No Enduro without the obligatory climbs before the fun..
The trailhead, and actually all trails in Sintra all starts next to “Tholos do Monge”, a mass grave built in the Chalcolithic period (2300 BC / 2000 BC) at the top of one of the highest elevations of the Sierra de Sintra. From the top you have a network of 25 different Enduro/HD style trails all decending down the mountains in different directions.
It is very hard to describe the Sintra forrest. It is something like a cross-over between a jungle and a Mediterranean forrest. This coupled with a misty carpet hovering a few meters above your heads turns the whole ride into a mystical-magical journey.
After a fantastic descent on the trails filled with fun obstacles, drops and flow trails, we climbed back up again to connect to another fun DH trail. I stopped counting the climbs up and down the mountain but the fantastic descents was the reward for the long climbs.
After a well deserved freshly grilled mackerel lunch at “the Bikers Refugee” in the small city of Penedo, we started the devilish climb back up to the top for our final long descent.
The Donkey trail starts at the top on Peninha, a very remote and isolated chapel overlooking the Atlantic with stunning views.
Words cannot justify the stunning views around Peninha. But best of all is the amazing descent.
After all the climbs I was ready for the long, breath taking descent to the towards the sea.
What goes up must come down. And that is a good thing!
We finished off the ride with a cold beer where we had parked. It could not have been better.
I’m glad that I took a day off the WebSummit craziness for a ride in Sintra despite being very tired from the outset. It was an amazing experience. Magical forrest, endless cool trails and a fantastic guide. I can definitely recommend to anybody who wants to ride in Portugal to contact WERIDE. These guys are pure Pros, attentive, fun and can adapt to any rider style from beginners to Pro-riders. XC, DH or Enduro, whatever makes you tick. They also know how to spice up the ride with espresso, lunch and a beer just at the right time when you really need it. They have top level, state-of-the art well serviced bikes and are very affordable, so it makes absolutely no sense to bring your own bike.
They do: half-day, full-day rides and also organize multiple days or week long rides all over Portugal. They even have their on RVs for maximum comfort for the longer rides. Enduro Magazine just came back from a couple of days with them and published this great piece.
I will definitely come back and I recommend mountain bikers who are searching for their next adventure to go and discover Portugal. You will not regret it.

We just returned from a short business trip to Lisbon with my husband. It was our first time visiting the city, and I can’t help but share this story.
We visited Lisbon right after our relocation to The Azores, San Miguel Island. It’s also Portugal but far from the mainland and is located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean but it’s another story… Since we had not visited this country before it was interesting to compare both locations, and got to know the capital of Portugal and the mentality of the locals.
The airport is right in the city, 30 minutes from the center, which is very handy and saves you time.
The old part of the city is pretty compact and no need to use transportation. It’s very nice to walk around. By the way, did you know Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world? And it’s worth the stroll, but most of the main sights in Lisbon could be seen in 2 days.
Lisbon is a relatively compact city, but it’s still a good idea to stay as centrally as possible!
Chiado and once again Chiado, and the area surrounding it!!!
It has a really wonderful, relaxed vibe. Everything is extremely close here. We were staying at 9 Hotel Mercy and were completely satisfied with the location and hotel.
If you want to save some money you can choose areas a little farther from the center such as Avenidas Novas and Alcantara — they are also good for long-term living. But in this case, you will need to use transportation.
The first thing I recommend after you leave the hotel is to have a glass of Vinho Verde — “Green wine” — which is a traditional Portuguese wine produced exclusively in the northwest of the country. It is lightly sparkling and low in alcohol. It’s really good!
Ginjinha. Trying ginjinha in Lisbon is a travel must. Actually, it’s a cherry liqueur that originated in Lisbon. A lot of bars serve ginjinha in small cups made of dark chocolate. Drinking can be fun.
Below I’ll share a list of dishes I’ve tried, of course, it could be longer, but I was only there for a few days. Plus, we had excellent breakfasts at the hotel.
Perhaps I would have started listing famous tourist attractions in the past, but it’s not so important to me now. I don’t like the fuss about it. Besides, such places are always so crowded!
Instead of visiting the famous Elevador de Santa Justa, standing in an endless line, and then in the small and stuffy elevator car (I googled and saw pictures of tourists), I’ll choose to sit in a nearby rooftop bar with a panoramic view of the same elevator and enjoy the wonderful view!!!
It’s good to read a few articles or watch a video before the trip to manage your expectations. Make a few marks on the map of places you want to visit.
I really couldn’t imagine traveling without a long list of must-see sights. But now I open up a google map with my marks on it and choose on the spot what place I want to visit depending on the mood. And that’s fine.
If I want to learn more about the city and its history, the best way to do it is to book a city tour for a few hours with a private guide who lives in this city and can share some personal stories from life.
From the beginning, it became clear that there was no point in comparing mainland Portugal and San Miguel Island. Yes, it is one country, but so different in so many ways!Generally, I like that Lisbon is lively enough and full of locals even in the city center. But a few things that were a little embarrassing to me are the tourists’ and emigrants' way of behaving, and it wasn’t just downtown. I would describe it as unbridled and disrespectful which makes the atmosphere around a little bit cold and not friendly. These are my personal remarks you might not even notice it, but my empathy didn’t allow me to ignore such things.
This city is a really nice place for tourists, but I would think twice about long-term living.

Hello World! — Excited to share with you how my first week in Lisbon with Remote Year went.
The City: Two words: Hills and Festivals. There are hills everywhere. Lisbon is the stairmaster city incarnate — I swear, we are all going to have nice butts at the end of this month. June is also a great month to visit because of all the festivals! All the charming little districts (Alfama, Bica, Bairro Alto, Castelo & Mouraria) bring the party to the streets to celebrate St. Anthony. Grilled sardines, bread with sausage, red wine, music and entertainment fill the streets for the entiremonth.
The Workspace: It’s a 10 minute walk from my apartment and folks shuffle in and out depending on their schedules.
The Gym: Fitness Hut: a 3 minute walk from the workspace and 55 Euros for 5 weeks. The biggest adjustment for me (other than not having my trainer Cheyne to keep an eye on me) is having to ration your water because there are no water fountains! You’d think they’d want to make sure you stay hydrated…
The Routine: Currently non-existent. When I wake up, go to sleep, eat, work out, code, and study vary at different hours of the day every single day. I guess my routine is: Do what you want when you want — I can’t lie, it’s fucking great.
The Work Situation: The UpWork profile is up but I’m having trouble even finding work to submit bids/proposals for. Most of the jobs require the freelancer to be physically located in the U.S and anything remotely related to Finance requires a lot of Strategy and Business Development experience, none of which I really have. I wallowed a bit for a few days: I realized that my resume was top-notch for a Corporate Finance job but unfortunately only that. Smaller and more nimble firms want someone that can not only manage Budget, Pacings, Close from an Operational side but also someone that can do Strategy, Business Dev and even some sales; coding experience would be a huge plus. It’s been a humbling experience for sure…
The Coding: The plan is to go through the free version of CodeAcademy (current progress at 35%) before I commit to the paid version. PluralSight was recommended as well so we’ll see. Luckily, I’ve got a team of software engineers on this program who are all so willing to help throughout this process.
Last but not least, the People: Remote Year Denali is a group of 40 amazing individuals, lead by our fearless leader and positivity unicorn, Erica. (She’s the one wearing the grey jacket on the bottom right of me in the photo below). Everyone is so incredibly talented, driven and passionate about making the most of both their careers and life — it’s impossible to not feel inspired to do the same every single day. Back home, I’ve always felt like the odd one out at work, always questioning things and always pushing the envelope because I wanted more: I wanted more to my career than what people decided for me and I wanted more to life than what I knew. I can’t tell you how incredible it feels to meet 39 other individuals who feel EXACTLY the same way.

Lisbon is an incredible energetic place. And since I moved here, in 2016, the city has developed a lot and, fortunately, it continues to innovate.
One of the best parts of living in the capital is being able to closely follow the growth of the gastronomic scene, which is varied and full of good representative chefs.
It wasn’t an easy task, but I selected my all-time favorite restaurants, from the finest to the tradicional ones — for all tastes and budgets.
Belcanto is one of the main references in the Portuguese gastronomy — with 2 Michelin stars and in 42nd place on “The World’s 50 Best Restaurants” list. If you are looking for an unforgettable experience, this is the place.
Ofício is one of those restaurants that we want to take everyone to visit. They have a menu of sharable dishes and finger food that are absolutely delicious. My favorites: Spider Crab, Sea Vegetable Taco, Old-fashioned Oven Rice and, of course, the best dessert ever, the Cheese Tart by chef Hugo Candeias.
This Viennese coffee house makes me feel at home. They serve traditional Austrian dishes, like Wiener Schnitzel, and my favorite pastries, Apfelstrudel and the Sachertorte. On weekends, they also serve brunch.
Bairro do Avillez is divided into two main areas: Taberna (a more relaxed space, with small dishes, charcuterie and finger food) and Páteo (a sea-food restaurant organized in two floors). My favorite dish is the Flaked Cod with Cornbread and Fried Egg. For dessert, my recommendations are Bairro’s Pavlova and the Olive Oil and Honey Pudding with Lemon Zest.
Tapisco is a mix of Spanish tapas and Portuguese cuisine, with a food menu that is meant to be shared. My recommendations: Tomato Bread with Jamón Ibérico de Bellota, Salted Cod “À Brás” and the Dark Chocolate Mousse with Olive Oil and Fleur de Sel.
The first time I went to Osteria was on my first date with my boyfriend. The place is very cozy, and they serve authentic Italian food, prepared according to old family recipes. I highly recommend the Focaccia and the Pasta al Pesto di Rapa Rossa (picture above).
This is one of those restaurants that is always full of cool people. The highlight, which captures the attention of all who pass by, is the giant Instagram-famous Octopus sculpture dangling above the dining room like a nautical chandelier. The food is Peruvian inspired and the signature dish is ceviche (as the name says).
JncQUOI is located in a historic theater that was converted into a fashionable place, with a high-end men’s store, a DeliBar with gourmet store, and a restaurant. There you will find classic Portuguese and International dishes signed by Chef António Bóia and a wine selection with over 500 references that promise to offer the best wine experience in the country.
Definitely the best sushi in Lisbon. It has the coolest bar area, an elegant dining room, and a beautiful garden for the warmer nights. If you can choose, I would recommend the sushi bar area, where you can see the magic happening. I’ve tried the Tasting Menu, that includes the best selection of creative sushi, sashimi and miso ever. Not to mention the dessert selection, where sugar balance was the rule and things as lime, chocolate, pineapple and flowers were combined in perfect harmony.
Located on the riverside of Lisbon’s Belém district, overlooking the Tejo River, the SUD Terrazza restaurant is influenced by Italian and Mediterranic cuisine. I highly recommend it for a romantic dinner or a family lunch. The view is amazing!
The Oriental Market is located in front of Martim Moniz Square and have lots of different food stalls. If you like Oriental food, this is the place. I recommend the first restaurant, right at the entrance on the left, and also the Mint House, on the second floor, with the best Pad Thai in Lisbon.
It was the smell of fresh pasta (and truffle) that led me to discover this restaurant, which is close to my house and has become one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Lisbon.
The environment is extremely cozy and the pasta is delicious. I’ve returned several times and keep ordering the same dish over and over again: Tagliatelle al ragù di carne. You need to try it!

Before we get into this post, I’ll admit I didn’t travel to Lisbon solo — but it felt like I did. I took this trip with my best friend (at the time), but it may as well have been on my own due to us wanting to do different things on the trip.
I’ll get into all that later, but for now, I’m writing this from the perspective of what I would do (and most things I did) when I travel solo, even if I technically traveled with someone.
In this post, I’ll share my honest review and opinions of Lisbon, Portugal, and what it’s like for a solo female traveler. I’ll also discuss some of the best things I saw, did, and ate while there.
I’ll also be diving deep into the more personal aspects of this trip, including some of the biggest things I’ve learned from my time there and some of the best people I met who have greatly inspired me.
Before I get into the best things I did in Lisbon, I NEED to talk about where I stayed! This hostel was probably the best I’ve ever stayed at — it had everything I could have needed, wanted, and more.
I stayed at Yes! Hostel and could not have chosen a better one. The staff were super friendly, very welcoming, and organized games, nights out, and pub crawls.

If you had ever been to Lisbon, probably you know the Tagus river (Rio Tejo), and Commerce Plaza (Praça do Comércio), but what many people do not know is what we can find in the other margin of the river.
On the south shore of the Tagus river, in Almada city, but precisely in Cacilhas neighborhood, in addition to the traditional restaurants, very interesting tourist activities and the unmistakable architecture, an abandoned pier and ruinous, little-visited nowadays and commonly known as Cais do Ginjal.
I discovered this pier, by pure coincidence, one day after visiting King Christ, I noticed that a few people were exploring on foot an unpaved street that goes down towards the river, I was curious and decided to follow the path to see what was down there.
The descent is a bit steep, slippery and full of holes, the view is very interesting because above we have the King Christ and below the Tagus river and the April’s 25 bridge, there were other foreigners exploring the same path, usually equipped with fancy cameras, comfortable shoes, and lots of sunscreen on the face.
The end of the path is surprising when we come across the Tagus River bank and to the right the…

“Once you start travelling solo, you wouldn’t want to go back!”
It all began in the year 2019. My Easter Break was thoroughly planned out. I was visiting my friend in Finland, and we were going to backpack Estonia. The only problem: This trip started on Monday, and it did not feel right to waste the weekend. And that is how my first solo trip happened.
I chose to go to Lisbon for I heard a lot about it, as well as its proximity to Madrid. I took an overnight bus, spent 16 hours in the city and came back by another overnight bus, thus saving me time and money. I had pre-marked a few things I wanted to experience, like a ride on Tram 29 and visit Belem for sunset. As soon as I reached Lisbon at dusk, I was welcomed by a grey sky and drenched streets. However, it was my first solo trip, and I was too pumped up to let this deter me. So, I proceeded towards my first destination, the Santa-Justa funicular(lift). Most cities in Europe offer a one-day public transport pass and, I could use the same pass for the Funicular. The Santa-Justa funicular, standing at the height of 15 floors, was at the centre of the city. It offered splendid panoramic views of this beautiful city.
Right next to the Funicular was the ruins of the Igreja De Carmo, an ancient church that could not survive the Portuguese war. These ruins reminded me of the fact that chaos can be beautiful. After spending some time there, I proceeded towards the centre of Lisbon- The Sao Nicolau. It was an ancient marketplace, now a wide-open space with the view of the church of Sao Nicolau. Walking through the streets around looking at the Portuguese architecture was an out-of-the-world experience. I stopped for a “Uma Bica”- the Portuguese coffee at one of the numerous cafes in the centre; this was not a typical espresso. The Portuguese roasting process is a bit different, giving the coffee a smoother texture.
Lisbon was one of the reasons I developed an interest in viewpoints. This city had so many of those that made it possible to get amazing views from different angles. Alfama was the second viewpoint, Santa Justa being the first one. Alfama was a little trek towards the top of the park, giving visibility of amazing landscape like the hanging houses. After sinking in the exhilarating beauty, I decided to board the Tram 29. Out of sheer luck on timing, this otherwise bustling tram station was empty. I hopped on the tram, and it took me around the city of Lisbon, and it was magnificent. Dense Portuguese architecture and the grey weather gave me the eighteenth century feels that I only felt from History textbooks. Tram 29 took me around the city, covering all landmarks, while I stood at the rear, looking through the glass with awe for an hour.
It was late afternoon when Tram 29 brought me back to the centre. I walked around the neighbourhood of Sacramento, exploring neighbourhoods, admiring the street art and local markets. By the time I covered quite aground, I had grown hungry. I was in the vicinity of Santa Catarina with no cafes nearby, except this small restaurant that had no customers. Finding vegetarian food initially in Europe was a problem. I went in hoping to find some food, and the kind chef inside asked me what I wanted. I told him that I was hungry and wanted vegetarian food. The guy’s exact words were “We are closed right now, but its difficult to find vegetarian food around. We don’t have it in our menu either but Ill whip up something for you”. And he did. He made me a special vegetarian platter. My experience with Portuguese was outstanding since the beginning of the day, but this incident took my heart away.
After a hearty lunch, I walked towards Belem. Belem had a great beach, yacht-dock with impressive views and a cultural centre. I walked into the cultural centre, saw some exhibits, and learnt some cool titbits on Portuguese culture and history. After an hour in the museum, I walked outside, along the coast towards the monument of discoveries. That was an immense marble wonder, standing on the banks of Tagus river, dedicated to the wanderer and discoverer, Enrique. By this time, the weather was quite good, and the atmosphere was upbeat. I took a seat and napped of for an hour. Fifteen kilometres of city-walking was a tiresome feat.
As soon as I got up, it was sunset time. And Portugal, the Westernmost country of Europe, offered fantastic sunset views. So, I went to the best sunset point of the city, and the third viewpoint, the Jardim Sao Pedro de Alcantara, a cheery cliffside. For a moment, I paused and reflected what a beautiful sight this was. Orange sky, scents of spring, calm guitar music and cocktails to melt for, it was a perfect conclusion to my first solo trip.
It was a bit scary and took a lot of planning. It was also a test for my confidence and a dip in my savings. But it was totally worth it. For otherwise, I would not have discovered the joy of being called a solo traveller. — I left a piece of my heart in Portugal.

The last time I was in Europe was in 2019 when I went to Web Summit Lisbon: the world’s largest tech conference.
I have the chance to be back in Europe this summer, funnily enough, in Lisbon again.
Turns out I really like coming back to places. I’ve got to reflect on the (massive) personality changes I’ve had since 2019… as well as the things that really haven’t changed (spoiler: I still get really loud when I am enthusiastic. And I have a very low bar for things that make me enthusiastic… things within life are just SO worth raving about).
My recollection of Lisbon in 2019 was entirely fantastical. I didn’t have one bad thing in my memory… I even forgot about all those stairs. Youthful bliss.
Adulthood comes with new features: some are good (wine at lunch) and some are not so good (an adult culture of complaining). This second time in Lisbon has me reflecting on my sense of adventure and open-mindedness from before. While places do have their downsides, overall, I think the big picture of life is generally quite positive; it’s something that adults lose track of among the millions of opportunities to be negative.
For example, Lisbon has many (many!) stairs/hills, but it’s also filled with stunning view points. I could complain about the stairs or I could appreciate the sheer fact that you can see the ocean, castles and millions of portuguese roofs from the centre of Lisbon.
Anyway, this is the start to yet another ramble about how great it is to be an optimist: to see the world for all its amazingness. While this is not a complex sentiment, it can be overruled with our primitive software (i.e., our brains looking out for danger) or the primitive software of other adults looking out for danger.
Let’s remember that the commodities of the 21st century are things the wealthiest of the 19th century couldn’t even dream of buying.
I’ve used the phrase zest for life over the last few years to ground my optimism for the world. I’ll attempt to inject this zest within the 5 lessons I learned (or re-learned) after my recent last 9 days in Lisbon.
While I was walking up a huge hill towards Jardim do Torel I noticed a very peaceful grandma sitting on a bench with her feet dangling and her hands doodling. The skies were perfectly blue and she was all cozy on the cobblestone road tilted 45 degrees.
There’s something so pleasurable about watching someone pursue their life for themselves, despite other expectations or limitations from terrain.
Similarly, my friend Jake writes a great and intense newsletter about golf, and while I am the furthest thing from a golf fanatic, I love reading his newsletter. He is so passionate and unapologetically a golf nerd that it’s just refreshing. It’s cementing to see someone else pursue their interests so boldly.
I like spotting the bullet-journaling grandmas and Jakes in the world.
It’s an art to pay attention and find these gems. But, if you look close enough, you’ll see many happy people and their passions flowing through their veins.
Our brains get easily flagged down by negative, ugly or scary things. I think the world is more kind than it is mean (re: Factfulness) but our minds have a huge distortion to notice the few mean things rather than the many kind ones. But with the art of attention, you can see beyond this distortion.
I’m a big fan of spotting cute things. Cute puppies in strollers, cute families with grown children… all wearing matching bucket hats, cute cartoons on fancy menus, cute babies with fat cheeks. It’s like a renewable resource of serotonin.
I even feel happy running around Lisbon in circles. Recognising spots from last time and places I’ve walked around a bunch this time.
Attentiveness allows me to log a street I’ve walked on such that when I walk on it again, it gives me a dose of familiarity: a very popular neutron-firing-pattern for the human brain.
I try to be attentive to all the Portuguese words, to recognise sounds and phrases, let them become familiar tunes instead of being drowned by the foreignness and communication barriers.
Essentially, there’s always a positive twist on my surroundings if I’m attentive enough. I derive a lot of happiness from hunting.
I’ve noticed a lot of people phrase their wishes in the past-tense:
These “wishes” are just regrets rebranded. I think the utility of regret is its ability to learn for or reframe the future. Why not reflect on regrets briefly, and then make wishes for the future?
Have wishes that aren’t regrets but plausible ideas:
Better yet, make these wishes more specific so that they’re not just theoretical.
Other than reflection, I see no reason to wish from the past. I see no reason to hold grudges. I’d like to learn from the past & pay it forward without dwelling.
One of my lowest points during this trip was when I was really tired and made a snap judgement about someone else. It’s inexcusable and not something I do often (thankfully), but also not something I’m immune to. It was a low point because I was really disappointed in myself.
I reflected and realised that I have my snap judgments in moments of desperation or insecurity. It’s not a them problem, it’s a me problem.
eople live lives with different compasses. They might achieve things in their lives I wish I could emulate or have, but instead of looking within myself for why I don’t achieve those things, I judge them to compensate for their gains with a loss. Basically, I will lower one element of themselves to feel less jealous.
I think this is a really rotten mentality. Lessening someone else to feel more secure yourself.
I believe I should appreciate subjectivity, i.e., respecting other people’s lives to co-exist with mine. Realising my beliefs are not objective and binarily correct, enjoying my life but not at the expense of how others want to live theirs and supporting other humans without being too pushy on my agenda.
Part of this journey has been internalizing that every human has something I can learn from. Everyone. They may lead vastly different lives than me but surely I do not have it all figured out.
Philosophically, my higher mind agrees with the notion of subjectivity and respect. But my monkey-mind can uncontrollably judge when it feels in danger.
I’ve been reading Tim Urban’s book “What’s our problem” and it’s undoubtedly inspiring these reflections of higher and primitive minds. The architecture of our brain is soooo ancient while the world is sooooo new; having a deep understanding of both is vital to co-existing in them sustainably.
Ancient = hunter-gatherers running from lions. New = can use a device built in 40+ countries to connect to the world wide web to click a button to borrow a bike for 10 minutes. These are very different scenarios!
The monkey inside my brain can mistake good, kind, different people with a lion trying to eat me. It will panic, judge, run, scream and desire a banana for extra running energy. And when it turns out that the person is in fact uninterested in having me for lunch, the monkey will be embarrassed it was wrong so it will use cognitive dissonance to rationalise how the perfectly fine human was actually a lion 10 seconds ago through the magic of animal-morphing technology that obviously the monkey catalyzed to relieve the threat.
I hope that’s enough of a vivid scenario to illustrate how silly our minds can be. Hence, I am working on a three-pronged approach to combat monkey-mind judgement:
During a conversation at Bahr Bairro Alto with Ula and João, we chatted about a random person pursuing a wealthy life in the more ‘traditional’ route. We’re a group of people who thrive on the unconventional route, so it was interesting to discuss someone with similar ambition but a different approach.
I just assumed this person was pursuing wall-street… because that’s what most people I know who want to make a lot of money do. But then they were both like no: think bigger.
I didn’t know there was something bigger than wall street? Turns out there’s a category well beyond wall-street that takes more insider information. Wall Street just has a good brand. Like Gucci (known luxury) vs Zegna (less known, but more luxury) or Rolex (known luxury) vs Patek Philip (less known, but more luxury)…. It’s a luxury so luxury that it’s off the market.
I liked learning this a lot since I get such a high off of learning about less-mainstream paths and more rare experiences.
This concept of thinking beyond the ceiling is so appealing. Our conversation added a new anchor within my pursuit for an interesting and status-quo-challenging life.
I have a very Serbian dad which means after his obedient medium-sized dog comes his stick-shift 2010 car with nearly 300,000 km logged. He taught me how to drive a manual car.
However, it turns out that driving on flatland & wide Canadian roads is VERY different from hilly, 1800s cobble-stone, windy, tiny Portuguese roads!
But you know… I did it and learned a lot.
There were many miracles along the way. Like how our Peugeot managed to go 120 km/h in 5th gear without falling apart, only getting a handful of honks and successfully avoiding all instances of parallel parking (big miracle, you have no idea).
We also had not 1, not 2, not 3 but 4 Portuguese people actively get in the car, demonstrate some of their manual car life lessons & help with hill-starts or parking. 3/4 were complete strangers who stopped everything to get in the driver seat, not kidnap us, and share their wisdom. Their helpfulness was such an asset and is one of the things I’ll really remember about this trip. It’s an energy I’d like to share more in life too.
Another thing I’ve noticed in Portugal that parallels my Serbian culture is how much people like to feed each other! Contrast to Asia, portions are VERY generous. It never feels like someone is optimising their margin. While this isn’t the most business-forward, life-wise, I really enjoy the vibes of the anti-stinginess. Essentially, I don’t want to make my wealth by selling the least amount of salmon for the highest possible price.
It’s been a really beautiful time… and in what feels like another full circle, I’m off to London, the place I was supposed to go in April 2020… :)
I’m grateful for the strings of the world and for your attention… now go enjoy something around you :)
Isabella Grandic
PS. I have been watching some great optimistic takes on AI. I really liked this video and this one.

When Chris Pavone’s Two Nights in Lisbon was initially published in hardcover last May, there was a great deal of pre-release hype behind it. I got a print galley, a digital galley, and then a finished copy of the novel — which all came to me by the publisher without much prompting on my part if I’m recalling things correctly. Thus, it seemed like the publisher was particularly interested in promoting this one quite heavily from my perspective. But that’s not all. The book was generously blurbed, and quite gushingly, by several A-list American authors, including John Grisham, Stephen King, and Megan Abbott. Grisham and King, in particular, trumpeted the fact that this was a novel that you couldn’t put down. Indeed, this is a bit of a page-turner — if you don’t mind thinking about taking a nice hot shower as you read this. The thing with Two Nights in Lisbon is that it is more than just an effective thriller: it has something important to say and the ultimate subject matter of this novel is quite unsavory as it might be topical. I don’t want to reveal too much for those who have yet to wade into this book, but, suffice to say, I found myself putting it aside at certain moments because the real crime presented within it is so repellant and distasteful, if not violent, that I needed to take a break from the mechanization of this tome’s harrowing plot.
The novel is about a newlywed couple who are vacationing, sort of, in Lisbon, Portugal. I say sort of because it is also something of a business trip for the groom, John. However, he goes missing one morning and his wife Ariel immediately goes to both the police and the American embassy to get them on the case. Neither, of course, is of very much help to her. Then, she receives a phone call: it turns out that John has been kidnapped and Ariel has 48 hours to pull together three million euros in ransom to have him returned to her alive. Ariel, of course, doesn’t have that kind of money, but she happens to know people in her social circles who might. That is, of course, if they want to help her out — and they might have their reasons for not wanting to. And thus begins a bit of a cat-and-mouse game of double-crosses and requisite plot twists, and, naturally, the CIA winds up getting involved — which shouldn’t be saying too much as this is something mentioned near the beginning of this book.
Does that sound like a good premise for a thriller? It does to me, too. However, Two Nights in Lisbon veers off into unpredictable territory even though you can kind of figure out what’s likely to happen before it happens. This doesn’t make the book a less-than-stellar read; quite the contrary. This is a well-done slow burn, and the novel does go into important territory that has been covered by many thrillers being released these days: those that detail violence that is implicit against women. To that end, Pavone does a masterful job of creating a believable female protagonist who is quite vulnerable, but who does her fair share of fighting back against all sorts of injustices that are done to her. That’s probably the big selling point of this novel and what makes it so immensely readable. Having said that, though, this is also a challenging read because the book’s subject matter is bound to make readers quite uncomfortable. Thus, Two Nights in Lisbon is not an easy book to take. While it is a relatively quick to flip through even at being more than 400 pages in length (and it is a quick read because of its semi-predictability, which is a pleasure of its own and keeps the narrative moving), it could have been trimmed just a little bit. It feels a little overlong, with an epilogue that feels a bit tacked on to give this book a mercifully happy ending. (Or as happy of an ending as you could expect from a book such as this. This is not to say that I’m not happy it ends the way it does, but these characters really go through the wringer and there could have been, perhaps, a little less of that in the lead-up to the end.)
In the end, I’m not sure how far I would go in recommending Two Nights in Lisbon as a must-read novel. It is very well done, but it made me squirm. The writing is top drawer for being genre fiction— flaws are damned. And the book does have them: you can’t think of the twists and turns too hard, or the plot kind of comes undone. Without meaning to spoil anything, it turns out that the kidnappers go to an awful lot of trouble just to achieve their ends — though, at the same time, they must go to the lengths they go to. (For this reason, I guess I’m of two minds about this book.) In any event, perfection is always hard to come by, so we should be very satisfied with the care and craft that Pavone has put into this novel about the ugliness of American society and how women tend to get treated within it. Overall, Two Nights in Lisbon is going to appeal to readers who like their thrillers to thrill, but perhaps not too much. Me? I liked this, but didn’t love it — and the reason is that I now feel as though I have to have that hot shower to rinse away the griminess of the major crime that is ultimately revealed here. Two Nights in Lisbon is worth a look, but just be prepared to go against what those A-list writers were raving about. This is a novel you’ll want to put down now and then. You’ll need to just get through the repulsiveness of the female protagonist’s unfavorable experiences throughout this troubling yet searing work of genre fiction.
Chris Pavone’s Two Nights in Lisbon was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux / MCD on May 24, 2022.

A hidden gem in the western end of the European continent: This is Lisbon, a city full of beauty and poetry.
Located over seven hills alongside the Tejo river, Lisbon is attracting tourists, college students, and residents from all places.
The city is one of the oldest cities in the world and was first named Olissipo, founded by the Greek hero Ulysses after the Trojan War, according to an old legend. Lisbon’s streets of cobblestone, ancient ruins, and beautiful cathedrals transport the traveler through a thousand years of history, wars, and conquest.
Today Lisbon is flourishing with culture, music, restaurants, and concerts, mixed with nice weather and affordable prices. Visiting Lisbon, try their delicious fish and seafood cuisine. In June, sardines are grilled on barbecues on every street in celebration of the St. John’s bonfire festival.
Hop up for an adventure going to Belem Tower on a tram ride, and don’t forget to eat the delicious Belem Pastries. As the country’s capital, Lisbon holds worldwide cuisines reflecting its residents’ countries of origin. Great places to eat are the…

I was traveling in Lisbon. That day, I went to an old restaurant listed in the Lonely Planet guidebook. A guitarist was playing traditional Portuguese music. Tourists from all over the world were drinking wine and talking, their faces bright with laughter. I had a few glasses of wine.
I began to feel the buzz. I grew tired of the place and left.
I kept walking. Not along the routes tourists take, but deeper into the old city. There were no pretty buildings. The walls were faded, and the windows sat still in the dark. The road wasn’t smooth — just an uneven path of small stones and rough cobbles. Every step caught my toes. I kept losing balance.
As night deepened, dim streetlamps flickered on, one by one.
Women stood along the roadside.
Drunk, I approached them. I stopped in front of one captivating woman. I wanted to say something. She didn’t understand me — but she named a price in English. “Want to fuck,” she said. I couldn’t understand anything else she said.
I couldn’t afford the full price. I handed her a bit of money, then turned and walked away.
I approached another woman. Did the same — gave her money, then left. I just wanted to talk to someone.
I kept stumbling forward. The streetlamps swayed.
After midnight passed, fog began to settle.At first it hung loose, then thickened. It sank heavy into the pitch-black streets. Every shop was dark, shutters pulled tight. My sight blurred, then slowly vanished. I couldn’t tell street from wall. I walked with my eyes on the ground.
There was no one around. Once in a while, a car passed. Its headlights flared into the fog — then faded without a trace. The dampness clung to my skin. I kept walking, aimless. I didn’t want to stop.
Around dawn, the fog began to lift.A narrow alley appeared. Beer cans. Torn snack wrappers. Soggy paper cups. Traces of someone who had been there through the night. But no one remained. No women. No cars. No sound. No people — just what was left behind.
I was tired. I headed back to my room.
Morning was coming. The street had changed. Taxis and buses passed in steady rhythm. The green leaves of roadside trees glimmered in the morning sun.
At an Indian restaurant, the shutter rolled up with a loud clatter. Workers carried boxes inside, turned on the lights, and scrubbed the floor. The scent of spices filled the air. Metal pots clanged, hoses sprayed water, voices echoed. Everything was waking up again.
People walked. Shops opened. The day had begun.
And in the middle of it all, with sunken eyes from a night spent in the street, I quietly walked back to my room.

I’m going to go ahead and assume that 2 Chainz was visiting Lisbon when he made that song. Ok…..maybe that’s a stretch, but seriously this city is literally vibrating with some of the best energy I’ve EVER been around. And I’m one of those hippy-dippy, “I need to feel the aura, the mojo, the vibe”… whatever you call it, to get a sense of whether I’ll like something. AND THIS PLACE GIVES ME ALLLL THE FEELS.
The best way for me to describe it is to actually borrow from my home office, Havas Chicago. We have 3 major tenants of what it means to be a Chi-town Havaser, they are: All In. Clever. Heart.
You can tell that every single person in the Lisbon Village is beaming with pride for their agency, clients and country. They proudly represent some of the biggest companies in Portugal.. a leading grocery store, a major bank and even the train system. I’m helping out on NOS, one of the leading telecom accounts in Portugal. About a year ago, NOS came to Havas and said they wanted to completely re-invent the brand. Havas answered in the most ALL IN way ever……creating Havas Different, a culturally relevant, hyper-village focused model designed to service NOS. The team re-invented the way they work, so that NOS and Havas can fulfill the collective vision and grow together. WOW!
As a strategist, I know that clever insights are both hard to come by, but also imperative to doing good work. My mentor, Joao (The Head of Strategy), and the other strategists in Lisbon have it down pat. The insights they bring to the table are simple, yet poignant and surprising, yet delivered in a way that makes you feel like you knew it all along. For example, when NOS tasked Havas to create a campaign for the Christmas season, the team came to the table with most clever insight around the most prominent fixture of the season, Santa. They asked themselves: if we live in 2018, where technology rules our lives….why are we still writing letters to Santa? So, they created a campaign all around the idea that Santa MUST have a phone number and NOS was going to bring it to you. Again, WOW! (smart insight jealousy rushes all over).
Upon arrival at the office, I was immediately greeted by Maria José (a beloved receptionist). She and the others taking a smoke break immediately flashed me smiles, grabbed me for a typical Portuguese double cheek kiss and proceeded to start teaching me Portuguese phrases I needed to know. After that, my mentor Joao took me around the office and introduced me to everyone….again👏🏽 every 👏🏽single 👏🏽person got up from their desks, gave me a double cheek kiss and was ready to teach me about their agency and culture. Before the day was up, I was invited to take a walk all around downtown, view the amazing sunset from the River and try a shot of Ginginha, a trademark drink in Portugal. They welcomed possibly the most stereotypical American, midwestern girl with open arms and big smiles. Again, WOW (tear of happiness streams down cheeks).
So, like I said, it’s truly a vibe here. It’s hard to put into words. I can’t even do it justice, but I’m OBSESSED and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.

It’s a question I’ve been asked countless times since moving to Lisbon from Lagos. Sometimes it’s asked with genuine curiosity. Other times, it feels more like a challenge — a polite way of saying, “You don’t look like you belong here.”
But the truth is, I’ve been asking myself the same thing, too.
When you leave home — really leave it — you don’t just pack a suitcase. You carry your culture, your accent, your rituals, and your invisible expectations. You try to wear them lightly, but they cling to you in moments you least expect, like when no one laughs at your jokes, or when your food smells “too much” in a shared kitchen.
What I didn’t expect was that losing my cultural footing in Portugal would help me discover who I am.
Growing up in Lagos, everything felt loud and alive. The streets were full of stories. There was always a neighbor knocking, a generator buzzing, a market woman shouting the price of tomatoes like it was breaking news.
I loved it. And I also wanted out.

Lisbon is a stunning city.
While it might be true that 1-day only is almost nothing for you to see the beauty of it, sometimes 1 day in Lisbon feels like a lifetime.
If You are planning a visit for the city, or even if you have no idea on what to expect.
I Got You!
Lisbon, the Portuguese Capital is a metropole, but when compared to other big cities, such as NY or London, it has a slow atmosphere. It feels like you’re in a fisherman’s village along the river.
Even in a slow way, it works as a big city, it’s a capital where You take 10 steps and listen 10 different languages.
People form all around comes to here, and you’ll probably never run out of things to do.
After all If we’re being honest here, the city is almost never “sleeping”.
Especially in the summer, when one part of city is going bed while the other is waking up.
Lisbon can be a lot even in just a few days.
Crazy as it sounds, as a Tourist Guide the thing I like to do the most in the city is…

I finally made it to Lisbon — bright tiled streets, salty breezes off the Tagus River, and the unmistakable smell of butter and sugar from the bakeries.
And there it was — pastéis de natas — the flaky, creamy, caramelized, and still warm pastry.
I had one on a street corner in Belém and thought to myself, ‘Yeah, this is one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. For those that may not know what it is — think about a croissant and creme brûlée mixture (it tastes like heaven!).
But somewhere between that first bite and the tourist-packed café I wandered into next, a strange feeling crept in. And it wasn’t for Portugal, but rather for Seabra’s.
If you know, you know: Seabra’s is a Portuguese supermarket in New Jersey. For me, there’s one just over the Goethals Bridge.
Seabra’s is loud, a little chaotic, and smells like chouriço and old linoleum.

As a product manager who has navigated through various roles and experiences, I know how important it is to connect with others in the same field. But what happens when there’s no ready-made community for product managers in your city? You build one.
That’s precisely what I did when I launched the Product Management Society in Lisbon. The goal was simple: create a space where product managers could share knowledge, network, and help each other grow. But the impact has been far more significant than I ever anticipated.
The Product Management Society began as a small meetup group. We gathered product managers to discuss challenges, solutions, and industry trends. What I didn’t expect was how quickly the community would grow. To date, we’ve hosted 50+ events and built a community of 1,100+ members from multiple countries, all passionate about product management.
Our community is more than just a group of people — it’s a vibrant network of professionals supporting each other’s career growth. We connect through our Slack group, where discussions around best practices, job opportunities, and product management challenges take place. We also have a WhatsApp group (invite-only), providing a more immediate and casual way for members to stay in touch, share opportunities, and engage in real-time conversations.
We host regular events on Meetup, from casual networking to in-depth workshops and talks by seasoned professionals.
At the heart of our society is the belief that product management is better when we learn together. From our events and workshops to our blog, we are committed to delivering valuable content and experiences for PMs at every stage of their careers.
Some of the highlights include:
We’re not just about talk — we’re about action. The Product Management Society has already made valuable connections with companies and other organizations. One of the major highlights was our hiring event with Altar.io, which allowed our members to connect directly with a top product-focused company and potentially land roles in their teams.
We’ve also collaborated with Productized for multiple events, including where our members had the chance to meet industry leaders, expand their networks, and gain insights into the latest product management trends. Additionally, we partnered with Product Weekend for another collaboration that helped our members further their careers and expand their skills.
Furthermore, we have an ongoing collaboration with Radhika Dutt, the author of Radically Rethinking OKRs, as she works on her new book. This collaboration brings exclusive insights into how product managers can rethink their approach to goal-setting and OKRs, providing even more value to our members.
These collaborations are a testament to the growing influence of our society and the opportunities we can provide for product managers looking to advance in their careers.
If you’re a product manager based in Lisbon — or anywhere else in the world — we invite you to join us. The Product Management Society isn’t just about attending events, it’s about building relationships and fostering a sense of community. By joining our Slack group, you can start contributing to discussions and sharing your experiences. You’ll also find job postings, helpful resources, and answers to your burning questions. Our WhatsApp group (invite-only) takes the conversation to the next level, offering a more immediate space for feedback and quick interactions with fellow PMs.
Our Meetup page is regularly updated with upcoming events, where you can sign up to attend. Whether you’re looking to connect with peers, gain new insights, or find your next opportunity, there’s something for everyone.
The Product Management Society also runs a blog where members share their thoughts on the latest trends, challenges, and innovations in the field. Whether you’re a senior PM or just starting out, you’ll find valuable insights that can help shape your career and approach to product management.
You can check out the blog at blog.productmanagementsociety.com, where we post articles covering everything from product strategy to career advice. Our goal is to make this an ever-growing resource that PMs can turn to for practical advice and thought leadership.
Whether you’re looking to network, learn, or grow your career, joining the Product Management Society is an opportunity you don’t want to miss. We’ve created a space that fosters growth, collaboration, and professional development.
The Product Management Society has proven time and again to be a valuable resource for product managers. From hosting multiple events to building a community that supports one another, we’ve created something truly special in Lisbon — and we want you to be part of it.
So, come join us! Sign up for our events, join our Slack and WhatsApp groups, and start connecting with other like-minded professionals. Whether you’re looking to gain new insights, find your next job, or simply connect with others in the industry, we’ve got you covered.
Also, don’t forget to follow us on our LinkedIn page for updates and more!
Together, we can make the Product Management Society a place where we all grow, learn, and thrive!

Lisbon is Portugal’s hilly, coastal capital city. It’s Europe’s westernmost city and the only one on the Atlantic coast. From imposing São Jorge Castle, the view encompasses the old city’s pastel-colored buildings, Tagus Estuary and Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge. Lisbon’s geography, weather, and history make it a great city for running. There’s a terrific 5-mile path along the Tagus (Tejo) River, going by important museums and landmarks. A lovely downtown (Baixa) run along Av. de Liberdade takes you by important squares and buildings, to Eduardo VII Park. For hills, run the narrow streets and lanes of the Bairro Alto or Alfama neighborhoods, up to the Castle or one of the Miradouros (view points). The largest park is Monsanto, which is now well connected to downtown via a recently completed ‘green corridor’– a path through a linear park. And if you like hill running, this is your city!
Our complete guide to running in Lisbon can be found on the Great Runs site.
Riverside Run. 4.7 miles one-way to Belem Tower. Wonderful run along the water, passing under bridge. Numerous landmarks.Alacantra Dock. 2.8 miles west to Belem Tower. 2 miles east to Caise de Sodre.Monsanto Park. The largest park in Lisbon, with many km of trails. Pedestrian & cycle paths, forested trails, open fields, hill opportunities.Eduardo VII Park & Green Corridor. 65 Acre park located near central Lisbon. Highlight is the central walk with box hedges and a hilltop view. Green Route to Monsanto Park. About 2.5 km. northwest between Eduardo VII Park and Monsanto.Parque das Nações. Originally the site of Expo 98, now the ultra modern side of traditional Lisbon. Path along the bay-like Tejo River. Lisboa Marina to Vasco da Gama Bridge. A run along the river in the more modern part of Lisbon. Terrific 4 km waterside path. Baixa & Av. De Liberdade. Classic Lisbon run, from the River Tagus to Eduardo VII Park, through the Baixa and along grand Av. de Liberdade.Alfama Area. The oldest district in Lisbon. Enjoy the narrow maze of streets and hills. Bairro Alto. “Upper District” neighborhood just west of the Baixa. Narrow streets, lanes, and stair paths. Great viewpoints.Estádio Universitário de Lisboa. Centrally located sports complex 100 acres of outdoor running trails, tracks and green spaces.

MeetnGreetMe together with our amazing travel blogger would like to share memories and some tips with you in case you have been thinking about visiting Portugal for a long time, or just decided to go there an hour ago! Today we will explore the best of Lisbon, Porto and Sintra. Together with Anastasia.
“At the beginning I will give you some general information about Portugal. Portugal shares borders with Spain and it’s the most western country in Europe — sounds interesting, am I right? If you want to have a condensed view of European landscapes, culture and the way of life, Portugal might be one of the best options for you. I have been there twice and I am sure I will go there again. My both visits were in February (Yes, it sounds cold but believe me, even in February it’s +18 and sunny…and nothing can spoil your time there).
I have visited only Lisbon and Porto and some small villages nearby (for me it is better to visit fewer cities but to feel them, rather than explore the whole “Europe on two feet a day”. That is why today I will tell you about these 2 cities.
How to get there?
As it was a planned trip, I booked flight tickets in advance (Warsaw-Lisbon-Warsaw) and it was only 80 euros (which is very cheap I think). From Lisbon to Porto I travelled by bus — 4 hours and 20 euros- may be you will find a cheaper way to get there, but I didn’t have enough time for it and used a simple intercity bus.
Lisbon is the capital and the largest city of Portugal. Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world, and the oldest in Western Europe. There are a lot of tourists all year long and you have to be prepared for much attention (especially if you are a woman), tasty food, good wine and hospitality….let’s go!
I will tell you about places I have visited and advice YOU to visit!
Rossio Square (Pedro IV Square)
Lisbon’s most famous square. There’s no better place in Lisbon to soak up the local atmosphere than at Pedro IV Square. It has been the city’s main gathering place since the Middle Ages. Today, it’s the place where friends meet up and as a result it’s always crowded — you will not miss it.
Monument to the Discoveries
It is the mammoth white-stone Monument to the Discoveries. Do you all remember Vasco da Gama- the first European to reach India by sea….Yes-yes, he was from Portugal. Now you understand why they have this monument and so proud of it. You can ride an elevator to enjoy the view from the top of this Lisbon landmark.
Alfama
The oldest quarter in historic Lisbon, the Alfama district is dotted with architectural landmarks and it’s the charm of the neighborhood’s meandering streets, tasty food and wine, clubs with Fado (amazing music) that make the Alfama a can’t-miss destination.
And one more life-hack — Tram line #28
The historic “tram” takes you through the city’s oldest sectors past some of Lisbon’s most popular sights and attractions. You don’t have to pay extra money (the ticket costs like a normal one — 3 euro).
Belem Tower
Belem Tower, also known as the Tower of St. Vincent, this statue was designed to protect sailors on their voyages, faces the river and makes an incredible impression on you.

I fell in love with Lisbon probably on the day I was born, even though I never got it until I started to travel through the world.
When I started traveling, I began to look at my city with the eyes of a tourist, and that's the best way to find some hidden secrets or to look at places where you normally just pass through without even looking.
I’ll just share with you some 5 places not to miss in Lisbon and help you get as enamored with my city as I am.
Lisbon is such an old city that one of my favorite neighborhoods is older than Portugal, being over 100 years old.
It’s one of those more typical neighborhoods in Lisbon where you can Fado houses and still see a bit of an old times type of life, with a thigh community in the middle of a big city.
It had become a very touristy place in the last couple of years, but it’s still possible to get lost and find some old stores, where you can find fun trinkets.
Fado is part of the tradition not only in Lisbon but specifically in this neighborhood, where you can find a “Casa de Fado” almost in every corner.

This year I had the opportunity on both attending and speak at Droidcon Lisbon, in Portugal. It was an amazing first edition filled with amazing speakers and friends from throughout the country.
Recently I was searching for the slides of one of the talks and noticed that there was no global repository with them all, so well — now there is 🙌🙂.
If by any chance you’ve got slides that I ‘m missing — feel free to comment here or just ping me on twitter so I can add them 🙂.
None of this would be possible without the Droidcon team who organized the event, the speakers, sponsors, and of course all the attendees — thank you!
See you all next year 🚀

The final day on any trip is always a bit odd as there is a more clock watching brief to bear in mind as at some point there is that need to head off to the airport, you can’t just say sod it and get the next plane instead. And there is the packing, much of which on this trip meant refolding unused clothes we had brought. Mainly because there was the idea that we would come back in the evening, get changed, and then go out for food. Which didn’t happen at all, plus there was a bit of doubling up with hot and mild weather clothing. The unused side of the main case was a lot fuller than the dirty washing side.
Breakfast was the usual lunacy. We had been noticing little oddities, but I’ve rolled them all up into a leaving day edition. There has been a man in the hotel all week. Easily recognisable as he’s about 6’ 5”, bald and shiny at the front of his head, and then a foot long mullet down the back. He’s been getting a glass (for the fruit juice) and using it for coffee, pressing the americano button on one of the machines, and then whipping the glass out before the milk is poured (there is another machine which does just black coffee). He will then disappear, leaving the rest of the family in the restaurant, and then he would be back ten minutes later to do the same coffee routine all over again. It wasn’t until this morning that we saw where he was going. He went outside and sat in his car with the door open to drink his coffee, occasionally playing with the windscreen wipers (it wasn’t raining). I’m not who was happier with this arrangement, him, or his family.
Coffee in a fruit juice glass may sound weird, but there are always lunatics trying to go one better. In addition to mullet man, I have seen someone take a bowl (which is there for the cereals) and do their coffee into that. And conversely someone using a coffee cup to put their cereals in. Additionally, the breakfast room had a little Danone fridge in the corner, on investigation, it was full of Nestle yoghurts. I thought I wasn’t a morning person, but shit, I’m a fully functioning person compared to some of these.
Anyway, after the breakfast fun and games and packing, we checked out, left the cases, and went out for our last little wander of the trip. The fact we had dressed for going home and I had jeans and a jacket on meant it was bright sunshine and no rain.
We headed to the Edward VII park. It had been set out when most of the city was rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake, but they renamed it in honour of the visit of our king to the city in 1903. And for some reason they never renamed it back after he went home. Weirdos.
The park slopes gently uphill. Of course it does, this is Lisbon. You are going to be hard pushed to find anywhere flat to build a park.
About halfway up is the Pavilion Carlos Lopez which has some beautiful blue and white tiled scenes from history upon its walls.
In front of one a woman, and her photographer friend are set up. She has six juggling clubs with bright orange ends which she is juggling in front of the tiles while her friend takes phots from differing lengths away. When I say juggling, perhaps trying to juggle would be a more accurate description. When she drops most of the clubs, Helen and I say in unison, ‘sack the juggler.’
At the top of the park’s slope is a modern sculpture to the 1974 revolution.
And in front of it is the wonderful view down the hill, back over the laid out gardens, to the statue to the Marques de Pombal (who laid out the new city after the earthquake) in the middle of the double roundabout, along the main drag of the Avenue de Liberdade beyond and then there in the distance is the river.
Having come up one side of the park we go to amble down the other side and as we do we find ourselves outside the Lisbon Greenhouse.
It is a botanical garden, and we had seen the roof from above and the side and not twigged it was the greenhouse we had seen marked on the map. It is huge.
And full of greenery you may be surprised to know.
And flowers.
None of which I know the name of. Helen does, she knows most of them, and tells me what they are. Contrary to popular belief, I do listen when she tells me stuff, but where plant life is concerned, my mind does not want to keep that stuff. Which is a bit strange considering how much utter crap it is more than willing to keep.
I did retain the names of two, but only because I was been deliberately silly about them. Apparently, Nathan wants a cheese plant. Of which there were loads here, so many in fact it was more like a cheese forest, and I would certainly be happy if there was such a thing as a cheese forest and that cheese would grow on trees.
The other being a wisteria. And that’s only because I was saying I had heard people were going mad about this flower. ‘Really?’ came the puzzled response from Helen. ‘Yeah, it’s wisteria hysteria.’ I will point out I already had my coat and hat on at this point.
It was quite interesting, and I don’t mean in an air quotes fingers kind of way. Plus I was taking the opportunity to try and get some macro photography of the various flowers done.
I don’t know what these white ones are called, but trying to get near enough to them to do a macro shot was difficult as the juggler and her photographer mate had set up in front of them and now had another hanger on with them. In the previous half an hour or so since we’d last seen them hogging things worth taking pictures of, the juggling skills hadn’t improved.
We had heard the peacocks, but it wasn’t until we were outside again that we saw them. Just strutting around and not being tortured by moronic tourists into fanning out their feathers in distress.
There was time for a last café stop, a final cappuccino and pastel de nata in the park before it was time to head back to the hotel and pick up the cases ready for the journey to the airport.
Which didn’t take as long as the journey out seemed to.
I had the camera ready for some of the station art,
and got some blurred shots, some that missed altogether, some with window reflections,
and a feeling that somehow we’d missed a couple of stations as I was sure I’d seen some much more striking examples on the journey into the city.
The journey through the airport was smooth, bag drop was easy and for a change it was Helen getting the grilling about bag contents. Security was fine, there was a bit of duty-free shopping (not that there is duty on boxes of pastel de natas, just idiot tourist premium). I had been hoping to find a Forca Portugal store, but there wasn’t one. Having gotten Sporting Lisbon and Porto pens and magnets the previous day, I thought I would complete the big three, only for the Benfica official store not to have them, and the Football Gate store to have the Sporting and Porto stuff I’d got the day before, but to do no Benfica stuff because they had their own store.
Passport control was quick, and both coming out and going back the border police have been friendly and efficient. Something that perhaps the US ones could do with coming and getting some training on.
The queue at the gate was the usual bunfight / free for all. No sort of order in being called up, just get your elbows out and shuffle slowly forward in the queue. Or do what we did and sit there and wait for the back of the queue to come to us before joining it. And then find that on the plane there was no one else on our set of three seats, and the overhead lockers were empty. Bonus. Then it is roll to the runway and away we go.
Overall the trip was great.
Lisbon is a wonderful city. There is so much to see and do and four nights is nowhere near enough time to do anything more than scratch the surface. It is good exercise too, rest assured that if you walk for more than a couple of minutes in any direction there will be a hill to climb up or shuffle down.
The food has been wonderful, and it is cheap. Everything has been really tasty, and they certainly don’t scrimp on their portion sizes (they must know people need feeding up to be able to deal with walking up all those hills). And the people are so friendly.
The Azulejos are wonderful, and there are many splendid examples of art on the tiles. Although the occasional one did make us smile for the wrong reason. This one was designed to represent justice with the scales. But all I can see is saggy tits. Which again, says more about me than anybody else.
The only downsides have been the very showery weather, which no one can really do anything about, and which hasn’t dampened our spirits anywhere near the amount they have dampened out clothes. And the attempted pickpocket / bag theft thing.
But we would definitely recommend coming back with more time to get around more of the city and beyond (Sintra is only 45 minutes away).

I came to Lisbon for the vibe.
What I got was a full-body workout, a minor existential crisis, and two pairs of shoes that now live in the trash.
Let me be clear: Lisbon is stunning. Lisbon is magic. Lisbon is the seductive European city that will woo you with pastel buildings, flirt with you using tilework, and then betray you with an incline so steep your knees will write a resignation letter.
This is not a walkable city. This is a city designed by and for mountain goats.
You know when a city greets you gently? When it says, “Hey, take it easy. Ease into it. Grab a coffee. Sit by the river.”
Lisbon doesn’t do that.
Lisbon hands you a map, points vaguely uphill, and says, “Figure it out, loser.”
I arrived with optimism. I had good shoes. I had snacks. I had a plan.
Thirty minutes later, I was clinging to a stone wall, sweating through my t-shirt, trying to decide if I should keep walking or roll back down into the harbor and let the Atlantic take me.

March 17 has passed, and the EDP Lisbon Half Marathon 2024 is over. I can share my personal impressions about the race. There was a lot of fun, but also things the Lisbon folks should work on.
The race kit was okay, including a T-shirt, a bib, a cap (an excellent choice, as you’ll see why later), a magazine, some bags of tea, a cereal snack, an electrolyte pill, and a magazine. A very useful kit.
The quality of the T-shirt and the cap was very good.
My running buddy and I chose to stay in the downtown area, near the Marques De Pombal, at the Marques De Pombal Hotel, of course.
Access to the race is limited, and you can only get there by train. All participants must use the Fertagus train to reach the starting line at the Pragal station. To access the Fertagus train stations, athletes can use Lisbon’s public transportation system (subway, buses, and trains) for free by presenting their BIB. You have to take the metro and get off at the Jardim Zoológico station to get there. From there, you don’t have to go outside; just follow the train sign to reach the train station.
While on the train, I kept looking for the “25 April Bridge” to realize that we were on the bridge, just under the road where we were supposed to be running soon. The train trip was short, about 10–15 minutes.
We arrived at the last station at 8:55, and the race was supposed to start at 10:05. We thought we had plenty of time to get to our designated start wave. I was supposed to start from Box2, while my running buddy was supposed to start from Box3.
The first thing we noticed was that the only accessway was pretty packed with many people.
We did not panic and just followed the path until we got stuck in a sea of people. We were blocked in that spot for 30–40 minutes with little information about what was happening. There were no staff or organizing people around, just some policemen blocking the access.
We also thought we had time and space to warm up, but this was almost impossible with so many people trying to get into the designated starting box areas. This was my first half marathon where I did not do any warmup or stretching, nothing. It was impossible.
This was also the first half marathon where I had to stay in line and wait for tens of minutes with little information about what was going on. It was clear we were very far from the starting area.
At some point, the crowd started to move gradually, and we managed to pass the first checkpoint. We reached a zone where someone was yelling instructions about which way you should take to get to your designated starting area. There were no signs whatsoever, just a single volunteer yelling and trying his best.
For me, this was terrible organizing. Although I was at the race one hour and five minutes before the start, I didn’t manage to get to my box in time, and I had no place to warm up!
By the time I got to the starting areas, the lucky ones had already been in the race for 6 minutes.
I started at last! But it was so crowded on the bridge that I was forced to run on a metal grill next to the asphalt car lane. You could see the water down below, and the running feeling was odd. Most runners avoided the grill, but it was the only option to get in front of other runners. And I kept running on that uncomfortable grill for almost 1-2 km, I believe.
I overcame thousands of runners since I started from the back of the herd, and two days after the race, I am still paying for that effort. Around km 8, getting in front of other runners became easy. Till then, you had to do a lot of maneuvering to get in front.
I give a big F for the start experience.
The weather in Lisbon in March is unpredictable; while in the morning it is a bit cold, clouds cover the sun, but as soon as you pass 10:30, the sun comes out and starts to shine and burn.
My Garmin watch said that the average temperature was 28 degrees Celsius (82F) during the race, with a maximum of 33 degrees (91F). The weather prediction was 24C, measured in the shade, but starting with km 9, the entire race was under a nice shining sun.
Starting with km 18, I began to count the number of people who fainted on the side, and I think I counted 10–15 of them. Volunteers and medics were trying to relieve their pain, but seeing so many people dropping out of the race kind of made me more cautious.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed this race and loved my time spent in Lisbon. I recommend visiting this city because it is very nice, has good food, is relaxed, is clean, and has many things to do. It was my second time here, and I will come back the third, fourth, and fifth times whenever possible.
In my previous post, I wrote that my Garmin watch was predicting a finish of 1:46:54, and I thought that it was being conservative. I wanted to achieve more of a 1:44 finish time. It seems that Garmin wasn’t far off from my result. I finished in 1:46:46, which is eerily accurate!
I have mixed feelings about Garmin!
I’ve added some more pictures at the end and recommend doing the Lisbon Half Marathon. It is a race designed for a PB, and you can visit a great city.
The only tip I have is to get to the starting line two hours ahead, and I’m not kidding!

This was my fourth Web Summit, Europe’s if not the world’s biggest gathering of those plying the tech ecosystem. The conference has grown considerably since its humble beginnings in Dublin where its organizers remain domiciled. It’s not just the number of conference attendees, but its growing footprint in other regions that sets it apart from other confabs. Its portfolio currently includes Collision in Toronto, Web Summits in Lisbon, Rio and Qatar, and Rise in Hong Kong (2025).
Here are some data points from the just-concluded Lisbon event:
The record-breaking attendance happened despite the conference founder’s ill-conceived remarks on the Gaza conflict two weeks before Web Summit started. It sparked an exodus of big-named sponsors and speakers, as well as the resignation of the founder himself.
Very quickly, however, Web Summit secured a new CEO, Katherine Maher, the CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, who plugged the leaks and, within two weeks, righted the ship.
One afternoon back at the hotel, we shared an elevator with Katherine, where we had a chance to let her know how much we enjoyed her opening night presentation. She appreciated the feedback.
Since attending the final Dublin-based Web Summit in 2015, I’ve fallen into a regular cadence at subsequent events, including two on-stage moderation sessions, judging the start-up Pitch competition, participating in Mentor Hours, attending a couple of speaker dinners, and carving out time to listen to some of the more noteworthy speakers.
Two themes permeated this year’s conference: AI and climate, with the latter dominating many of the startups presenting.
On the AI front, I took the stage with Mikayel Vardanyan, co-founder of unicorn Picsart, the largest all-in-one creative platform of photo, video editing, and design tools — now fully immersed in Generative AI for creating images and video.
This is quite an impressive company with 1.5 billion downloads. Still, I had to bring up Gen AI bias after my query on the platform for a “successful business person” turned up four images — all of the same 40-year-old white man. I also worried aloud about the likelihood of bad actors using deep fakes to manipulate public opinion. Yes, that means you, Russia.
In my second on-stage session, I sat with some veteran marketing execs to discuss the changing role of the CMO. I reminisced about Y&R Inc’s “whole egg” approach wherein advertising, PR, and direct response comprised the three legs of the marketing stool. (Brand identity/design was siloed away back then.) I suggested that Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall, giving today’s marketers vastly more tools with which to work.
I suppose the greatest satisfaction for me was gleaned from connecting with founders about their early-stage companies’ plans to change the world for the better. This happened on the Pitch Stage where I judged a handful of companies whose solutions to small and big problems didn’t fail to impress. I also had a chance to mentor three young founders in the climate space: Guillaume Mandolini of EVAS, Dragan Gelevski of EarthCare.ai, and Diogo Costa of EcoCradle, who had these kinds words to share following our session:
There were other notable encounters, including over lunch when former Trump chief-of-staff Mick Mulvaney plopped down beside my wife and me. He, alongside esteemed journalist Michael Isikoff, suggested a political scenario in which both Trump and Biden drop out of the race. I wasn’t buying it.
You never know who you’ll run into at Web Summit, but everyone there had an affinity for technology and how it will continue to change our lives and livelihoods. Even Mick Mulvaney was there to speak about the tech regulatory environment.

Lisbon’s Soft Whispers: Esoteric Love Amidst Portugal’s Historic Lore,https://medium.com/@esomelodan/lisbons-soft-whispers-esoteric-love-amidst-portugal-s-historic-lore-ae543c40eb79,"Sign up

Introduction:
In the heart of Lisbon, a city steeped in history and shrouded in mystery, magic pulses truly under the cobblestone streets. *Whispers of Lisbon* tells the story of Amara, a young historian with a gift for paying attention to the voices of the past, and Rafael, an enigmatic mother or father with ties to a historical magical order.
When their fates collide, they must navigate the secrets and techniques hidden within the metropolis’s winding alleys and get to the bottom of a centuries-old curse that threatens to consume them each.
As love blossoms amid the shadows, they discover that their destinies are more entwined than they may have ever imagined.
Chapter 1: Echoes inside the Alfama
Amara Mendes wandered via the slim, winding streets of the Alfama district, the oldest neighborhood in Lisbon.
The scent of grilled sardines and freshly baked pastéis de nata lingered in the air, blending with the faint notes of Fado music drifting from a nearby tavern.
As she traced her fingers along the historic partitions, she felt it once more — a faint, ghostly whisper that simply she needed to hear.

I didn’t mean to get lost in Lisbon.
I had landed with a rough map scribbled on a napkin, a backpack full of enthusiasm, and absolutely no clue how confusing the city’s steep, winding streets could be. I’d seen pictures of the iconic yellow trams, the tiled facades, and the miradors overlooking terracotta rooftops. But none of those Instagram posts prepared me for what it actually felt like to be completely disoriented in a foreign city, hungry, sweaty, and mildly annoyed with Google Maps.
It started innocently enough: a walk through Alfama, the oldest district in Lisbon, with its maze-like alleys and whispers of Fado music echoing from open windows. I turned one wrong corner, then another, and before I knew it, I was somewhere between “definitely not where I should be” and “oh, this looks kind of magical.”
That’s the thing about Lisbon — it forgives your mistakes by rewarding you with charm. One detour led me to a tiny café run by an old couple who didn’t speak English but insisted I try their homemade bacalhau. Another wrong turn led to a bookstore with poetry written on the walls and a cat sleeping on a pile of Portuguese novels.
By the time I figured out where I was (eventually — thank you, tram 28), I had stopped caring about the original destination. Somewhere between losing the route and finding a rhythm, I realized that this…

To avoid the worst of the carnage at breakfast it was breakfast first then get ready to head out this morning to get more touring done. It had been raining when we got up but was bright sunshine by the time we were leaving the hotel, only for the moment we sat on the tour minibus it to want to start to rain. And we were on a minibus whose roof was broken and stuck in the open position. But we stayed in our seats and toughed it out as it went from rain to bright sunshine, back to rain and back to sun again as we went round.
We were on the green route and done the stretch from Liberatores to the Castle the previous afternoon, but this time we did almost the full route, only getting off when we got back to the second Liberatores stop and hour and a half after the first one.
And I don’t give a shit if I am repeating myself, I would not want to be driving on most of the roads the minibus travelled on. In fact I would go so far as to say that driving in Lisbon is not for me full stop, but it does lend some insight to the story of the Portuguese taxi driver we had in Leicester back in the late eighties.
There is plenty to see on the way around and it is a struggle to get anything remotely related to good photos. Between dodging raindrops, the vibrations of the cobbled streets, there are angles to consider, bus frame to avoid, and when you think you’ve got it all lined up ready to go the lights change to green or traffic clears and the bus lurches forward with some sudden acceleration.
What the results look like will be interesting viewing once back home and they have all been loaded onto the laptop.
When we got off the bus, we chose a different road to wander down to get to the river, picking one which isn’t festooned with cafes and restaurants and full of desperate men trying to strong arm you into eating at their particular offering. The number of times you can run that gauntlet without just wanting to scream at them to fuck off is limited. The one we pick has a gentle incline to it, which is somewhat of a concern seeing as we are supposed to be heading down to the river. We reach the crest of the road and find it must have been more than a gentle climb. Either that or we are getting used to the hilly nature of the city, as the road down the other side is seriously steep, and we really didn’t think we’d come up so high.
At the top there was a mall, which we took advantage of to use the facilities (that is one thing about Lisbon which isn’t great, there aren’t very many public toilets at all, and so when there are, there are always queues). I’m queuing for a cubicle only for a little brat to queue jump and run in when the old man in there leaves. I take the next available one, and whilst in there I can hear the impatient brat shout to his dad, ‘I’m finished.’ His dad tells him to wait while he himself finishes. Only for the kid to yell ‘for fucks sake, hurry up, the Lego shop is closing.’ (It wasn’t it was half twelve and they don’t shut for lunch.) Hopefully, the Lego shop became the Lego-without shop for the little shit.
The road down takes us back to the Commerce Square and across to the river. It’s time for the next tour, only this time there is no bus, it is on the river. There’s a big river and tours on the river, so of course we are there, we’re well-known suckers for a water level view of a city.
We get some refreshments, sort out the correct token for the tour (part of the HOHO ticket), and find the correct queue (not as easy as it sounds) and get on the little boat. And when I say little boat, I mean it. We had seen the larger boats for other tour companies on the river, but this is tiny, like a minibus compared to the double deckers the others are using. But even so it isn’t full.
Again the weather thinks it is funny. It was bright sunshine as we sit having a bit of lunch, the rain only appears when we set off on the boat. It does have most of its plastic splash protectors down which helps. But not with taking photos.
But the rain does fuck off to be replaced by the sun before too long.
The original route is for the little boat to go down the south side of the river on the westbound leg of the journey, but with the rain, and the threatening clouds, it stays to the north and concentrates on the Lisbon side of the river.
Being out in the vast expanse of the river gives you an unobstructed view of how the city rises away from the river and the layers of buildings of all types rising into the hills.
The cargo terminal is fascinating (to me anyway). Just how huge the container ships are, and how the containers slot together to stack up and stay in place like a giant Lego set. (perhaps drop some on this on that kid from earlier).
And there is the bridge. You can see it is large from a long way away. But the sheer scale really hits home when you are going under it.
It had looked as if our little tour boar was going to ram the yacht, but we only passed close by to it just as we were both going under the bridge, which made a decent photo.
By the time we had made our way past the MAAT buildings we had been on the day before, and out to Belem, the sun was shining.
And there were plenty of opportunities to take decent photographs of the Monument to the Discoveries.
The Belem Tower is a much better photograph from the water than from the top of the tour bus as attempted yesterday.
This is where we turn around to head back and there is a terminal for people to get on and off as even the boat tour is a HOHO. Every other passenger got off, and were replaced by a new set, and off we went back to central Lisbon.
We crossed over to the southside of the river to do so. And besides the obvious tourist photographs of the Christ the King statue, there was much that interested me.
A bit further out to the west from Belem was this, which I am assuming is some kind of refinery type building.
Just before the suspension bridge is another very colourful refinery building.
There are egg shaped structures set into the slopes of the south bank.
And once past the bridge and all the way along the bank until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
We swing back over to the north side of the river and with the sun shining on the city along the stretch of government / municipal eighteenth century buildings painted in assorted colours, and the domes and spires of churches behind them, it has a very Venice-esque look to it.
When the little boat docks at the third of its little stops we get off. The wind whilst on the water has been bitter and we have walked the short stretch back to where the loop would be complete before, so we head off to look for food and to warm up.
The pier is close to where we ate on the first night we were here, and therefore we know that the Time Out Market is only just behind the buildings we can see.
But it is chaotic in there and we want to be able to just sit and relax, order something from a menu and have it delivered to a table, not try and work out which of the forty odd options to order from and then fight to try and find two seats together somewhere in the heaving mass of humanity in the middle of the hall.
We do take the opportunity to use the facilities though. Whilst I am waiting for Helen (the queue for the ladies is unsurprisingly longer and slower moving), I see a bloke go and drag his (I assume) other half out of the queue and shove her into the unused baby change facilities toilet. Once she is in there he is pacing furiously back and forth but gradually further away, and then outside. People who actually have babies to change are now queuing to use it. I get the feeling she’s had more than enough of his shit and is deliberately taking as long as possible or just hiding. Helen comes back before she reappears, but he’s not in sight, and we go the other way. Hopefully, there was a backway out and he’s still pacing there now. Alone.
We use the guidebook to see if there are any recommended eateries near to where we are, and it does mention a place within a couple of minutes’ walk the Rio Grande. A lovely old traditional restaurant with decorative tiles on the walls and old wooden beams.
What we didn’t realise when we went in from the front door was that the side window where we were seated overlooks Pink Street.
And outside our window as we eat there is a drag act in a skintight purple jumpsuit with a long blonde wig (which keeps trying to escape) on roller skates, and armed with a wheelie bin, who is entertaining / terrorising the passing tourists.
We had found Pink Street as we had wanted, but without even trying.
The food, as all food so far has been, was lush, and after getting past the drag act unmolested, we headed back up another different street towards the hotel. Where it was a case of have a bit of a rest and then change to layer up for yet another tour. This time the night bus tour. And not a single Harry Potter in sight.
Three of the others who had been on the previous evening’s walking tour were on this tour as well, making the fullest use of their tickets as well then. But on the whole, it was a sparsely populated bus when the tour set off. Which did mean it was good for me as I could move around a bit in the hope of trying to get some decent photographs.
It starts out fine as there is still reasonable light at 8pm.
But night is falling, and it is doing so quickly.
And whereas the camera can cope with any difficulties thrown at it in daylight, at night it struggles. (or to be more precise, I struggle to be able to set it up, so it doesn’t struggle as much.)
It can cope OK when it is dead still, but as the night tour doesn’t have and pick up points around it the only stops are at traffic lights, so there is a fair bit of motion to deal with.
And as light fades the camera tries to extend the shutter speed to let more light in, which when moving means blurring.
So there I am hoping for traffic lights to be red, or for magical traffic jams to appear.
To be fair I did get some reasonable shots whilst the bus was stationary.
But the one I wanted was when the route went over the bridge above Pink Street. I knew when it was coming, I had the lens at the right length of focus, I had the timing right, but the bus was moving too quickly as there was no traffic and no traffic lights and so it ended up a bit blurry.
It is dark by the time the hour-long tour is up, and we head back to the hotel. We had seen the café on the roundabout was open as the bus came past. Two minutes later as we pass it walking back it is closed and in darkness, so it is back to the room and chill.
There are no planned tours tomorrow, just us mooching on our last full day.

If there is one thing we understand, it’s the importance of your student accommodation towards your general student experience. What’s more, we know a huge factor is your student home’s location. You want to live in one of the best neighborhoods, one that’s just as perfect for you as your residence. If this is you, let us guide you through Lisbon’s best neighborhoods for students!
Definitely one of the best neighborhoods for students, it’s very, very popular with international students. Marquês de Pombal is known among the locals as the central business district of the city and also as a major transportation hub. With two metro lines crossing here, and something like 20 different bus lines to catch, you’re always just a shot away from any place in the city. During the day, catch the sun up in the Eduardo VII gardens and after nightfall head down to the Kiosk-bars of Av. da Liberdade for drinks with your friends. There are many student residences nearby, including several that are Erasmus exclusive. Check out our student accommodation in Marquês de Pombal.
An Erasmus favorite! If you don’t want to have to go to parties, but prefer the parties to come to you, rent a room in the Bairro Alto. From Thursday to Saturday, the crowds fill up every one of the tiny bars here and spill out onto the streets. Thankfully, it’s quiet enough during the day, so you can party as much as you want throughout the night and then spend your mornings taking it easy inside. Friendly warning, you guys: Bairro is for party-animals only. Check out our student apartments and studios in Bairro Alto.
The large avenue (Alameda d. Afonso Henriques) that gives this area its name has a very wide garden with plenty of places for taking in Lisbon’s great weather and a kiosk-bar where you can have one of the coldest — and cheapest — glasses of beer to cool off. The streets to the sides of Alameda have plenty of student flat shares that are popular with Portuguese students, especially students of Instituto Superior Técnico (- called IST, or Técnico, for short). Click the link if you want to check out some student shared apartments in Alameda.
The neighbourhoods of São Sebatião and Saldanha are between three of the main universities of Lisbon: Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Nova), Universidade Católica de Portugal (Católica) and Técnico. It is not surprising, then, that you will find a student in nearly every building of the area. Some places like Bairro Azul are almost entirely occupied by students. It has great transportation options, the Gulbenkian Foundation with its museum, library and gardens (useful whether you feel like art, a stroll or some study time) and El Corte Inglés, the huge department store that also has over 12 cinema rooms. Click the links if you want to browse for student apartments in Saldanha or to rent student accommodation in São Sebastião.
Alfama is not only the historical quarters of Lisbon, it’s the city’s heart and soul. This is a personal favourite of mine — the neighbourhood where I have always lived. You’ll find there is nothing more charming than Alfama’s crazy, maze-like streets, and there is no better way of taking in the city’s culture than getting lost here. At night, you can hear Lisbon’s traditional music, Fado, being sung from a hundred little restaurants. Houses and apartments are traditionally rather small and hundreds of years old, but some studios and apartments have been recently refurbished and make the perfect student homes to live in. Interested? Click the link to see student accommodation in Alfama.
Thanks for reading this post! We hope to see you soon, coming back for more.
Did you enjoy our article? Just drop us a line in the comment section below to let us know you did. And remember! If you need to find accommodation in Portugal, you’ll find the perfect place to call home on Uniplaces.

The History of the Siege of Lisbon by Jose Saramago (reviewed by Richard Seltzer),https://medium.com/@seltzer_57387/the-history-of-the-siege-of-lisbon-by-jose-saramago-reviewed-by-richard-seltz45-3a4214aed473,"Sign up

This is an excerpt from my book One Family, which is available from Amazon.
At the start of the Second Crusade, troops sailing to the Holy Land, stopped, by chance, at Lisbon and helped defeat the Moors, resulting in Portugal becoming a country and Afonso Henriques (our ancestor) its first king.
Jose Saramago (Nobel winner) wrote a novel with the title The History of the Siege of Lisbon, which questions historical truth in a paradoxical, philosophical, and comical style that resembles that of Borges and Lem. At the same time he tells the love story of two employees at a publishing house in modern-day Lisbon, a proof-reader and his boss.
The proof-reader, succumbing to an inexplicable urge, changes one word in a history book about the 1147 siege of Lisbon. The Crusaders say “no,” instead of “yes.” They sail on rather than stopping to help fight the Moors.
A woman hired to supervise proof-readers and prevent another such egregious error is intrigued by the implications of the mistake and by the proof-reader himself. She surreptitiously suggests that he write a novel that explores the possible consequences if that “no” had been historically true.
The narrative switches back and forth between present-day Lisbon and an alternative medieval past written by the proof-reader. His version of what happened is consistent with the fragmentary historical evidence, and is credibly told, with gritty texture and the addition of a love story that parallels his romance with his new boss. The Crusaders’ decision, rather than creating a tornado of consequences and changing all that came after, only leads to differences in how the battle is won and who deserves credit; the outcome is the same. The rip in time caused by the change from “yes” to “no” closes as if it had never happened. The fictitious version of events, created by the proof-reader, might be closer to what actually happened than the official version.
Saramago turns what might otherwise have become an academic discourse on history, fiction, and truth into an entertaining double love story that plays out in the same city, but separated by 850 years. In this book, facts aren’t as important as they’re usually represented to be. There are a few well-known fixed points on a time line, and there are numerous possible story-paths from one point to another, all of which are equally valid, because they lead to the same conclusion. By looking at more than one possible path, you come to know the characters and their circumstances with the texture, ambiguity, and shading of reality, with its dynamic tensions and ever-changing possibilities, rather than with the static view of linear historical narrative. The author succeeds in showing the heroic and passionate potential of everyday people in everyday circumstances.
I wish I could achieve such a result.

At Christmas I got several photography books in the Abandoned / Oblivion series of books published by Jonglez; Abandoned Churches, Abandoned Spain, Abandoned France, Abandoned USSR, Oblivion, Forgotten Heritage, Forbidden Places. I’ve had a look at the other titles in the series (USA, Belgium, Australia, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Germany) but was surprised to find there isn’t one for Portugal.
Having spent four days wandering around Lisbon I am sure that an intrepid urban explorer and photographer could fill such a book with examples from Lisbon alone.
There are lots of properly abandoned buildings all over the place of all shapes and sizes.
Some on the main streets of the city, boarded or shuttered up.
Peeling paint or plaster disappearing from the surface of the buildings helped along by the constant weathering.
Nature is trying to reclaim some of these for itself. There is a lot going on.
Unlike a lot of examples included in the series of books I have seen and have mentioned above, these aren’t necessarily isolated buildings. They sit in and amongst fully functioning, well kept and maintained, houses, shops, restaurants, and other businesses.
It is oddities, it isn’t like they are whole blocks left to go to rack and ruin. I may have seen one side of a street where all the buildings looked to be abandoned and on their last legs, but that was the exception rather than the rule.
To the south of the city and all the way along the bank of the River Tagus opposite Lisbon, from the April 25th suspension bridge going to the east until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
They look as if they must have been industrial units, but the whole stretch is mainly roofless, and the graffiti artists have been out in force.
It did look as if there was one little bar in amongst it all. But there was no obvious route down to get to the stretch of buildings. How would someone get there?
I am fascinated by this stretch of buildings, but as to how to get in there, I’m better off not knowing as I would just have spent a lost day wandering around the whole stretch clicking away and filling up my SD card.
And the spare one.
There are other buildings in disrepair, but they at least show signs of being worked on, metal and wooden fences surround them. There are piles of materials around, and there are cranes hovering above them.
I suppose if you went and looked hard enough in any town or city you would find examples of abandonment, but it feels different in Lisbon, I haven’t gone searching for examples, it is almost as if they have come to me. Though what I find strange now that I am home and I am searching through all the photographs I took, is ones I am sure I took of abandoned and crumbling buildings aren’t there, which makes me doubt my sanity. Most of the ones I have are of the riverside.
But I don’t speak the language and therefore don’t know what any notices on buildings may be saying. I don’t know what the law is about entering such buildings, and how the police would deal with such things. And most importantly I am on holiday with Helen, so I don’t go looking for that opening, for a chance to get inside one of these buildings and snap away.
Perhaps someone will, or there is someone already doing it, or even someone has already done it, and it is the next Jonglez abandoned series one to come out.

After two days of being toured out, it was time for a bit of freestyling. It did still start on a bus though. A regular Lisbon public transport one, taking us down to one of the main squares in the centre of the city. Whilst waiting for it to turn up I was admiring the doors and doorways as I usually do (yes, I know I’m strange), and I saw this one close to the bus stop.
Noting the number twenty-five above it, I spent the rest of the day looking out for any other doors or doorways with the number twenty-five above them. It was a surprise just how many streets there were where the numbers stopped at twenty-three, or upon which the number twenty-five was missing from above the doorway where number twenty-five should be. Still, I got plenty for the little side project that had popped up in my head.
We were on the bus to the end of the line at Rossio, and from there we started the long slow ascent up through winding narrow cobbled streets and steps up (and some back down again thirty yards further down the same road).
Some of the streets in this area have poignant pictures attached to the walls, some project which took photographs of those who live, or used to live in the houses there and they have been reproduced onto boards in an almost sepia colour, the history from inside the walls being displayed on the outside of them.
There were a couple of stops to do some shopping for tat. The usual, pens, postcards, fridge magnets. But we made it up to the castle entrance.
Which was a lunatic asylum. The queue was stupidly long, and there appeared to be three different sub queues and people changing between them because they didn’t know which one was the correct one to be standing in.
We weren’t desperate to go inside the castle and so we wandered the streets around the castle complex at the top of the hill. We saw (and heard) peacocks. Only for some dicks to come along and deliberately spook the peacock so it expanded its tail feathers as a defence mechanism. There really are some stupid humans around.
There are also Azulejos on walls everywhere in many different patterns and assorted colours (which triggered another thought for another little set of photographs for a project).
Before we stopped for a drink in a café called Tram 28. (Named for the tourist tram which rattles up the narrow streets to the castle and always looks like a sardine tin on rails.) The inside looks as if it has been built from two trams pushed together. A drink turned into lunch and a postcard writing session before we headed on.
And it isn’t everywhere where you are going to find a Tram Burger.
Across the little square was a church, we went in one side and out the other, and briefly thought about going up the tower, but a rude German family pushed in, and we saw the cost, and decided against it.
Instead we continued wandering around the narrow streets, gradually making our way down and out of the castle complex.
We then did a bit of retracing steps, following a bit of the route down from the castle to the cathedral which we had taken on the waking tour a couple of evenings before. I nipped into the cathedral to get a fridge magnet and a brief dodge of raindrops before heading on.
And out the other side we were then walking on street not previously travelled. More narrow streets, little alleys, steep staircases up, and down, between all sorts of buildings.
Unlike the planned grid of the centre of the city, this part of the city, Alfama, the oldest part, a lot of which survived the earthquake of 1755, wouldn’t know a grid if it hit it found the face with one of the cities beloved sardines. It is wonderfully winding, and you might spy where you want to be heading, only to find a couple of minutes later that it is in a totally different direction to the one you thought you were heading in. We pick up a couple of pastel de natas to help us along the way.
It is in this style we wander the streets before eventually finding our way up to the church of St Vincent. Which is absolutely huge. And wants to charge for you to go in.
But they, as the cathedral did, have some doors available for you to go in and sit in the back two rows of the nave of the church and get a long-distance view of the inside of the church (easily overcome with a zoom lens).
The intermittent showering has turned into constant drizzle, and the back two rows of the church were a brief interlude, we stop at a café to, if not dry off, then at least stop getting any damper. A drink and a pit stop later, and it is back out.
It is still raining. We make it down to the former church of Santa Engracia. This baroque church is no longer a place of worship. It now houses the Panteao Nacional (The National Pantheon).
This time we do pay to get in, a prolonged break from the rain will be good. The building houses the cenotaphs and tombs of famous and influential figures from Portuguese history.
It is a serious space, but I can’t help it if my head is the opposite of a serious space, and seeing this name on one of the cenotaphs, I can’t help but ask does it also contain a hot dog, and a jumping frog.
A lot of the tombs now housed here were originally entombed at the Jeronimos Monastery before they were moved here in the 1960s. Reading the biographies of the people here next to each of the monuments, you can’t help but notice just how many of them went to the University of Coimbra, which must be the Portuguese equivalent of going to Oxbridge.
We are able to go up to various levels, where there are displays of reliquaries, and collected artworks.
And then we are up at the dome level. There is an exit out onto the (nearly) flat roof.
On a clear dry day, the views out over the city and the river must be spectacular. But it is neither. The April 25th Bridge and Christ the King statues are barely visible through the low cloud / rainfall. But it does seem to be easing off.
Inside the dome there is a walkway all the way around the dome. It is a long way down. My knees were going (and not just because of all the steps climbed to get up here) and the head was a bit woozy.
By the time we had made it back to ground level and had a walk around the former church and chapels looking at all the luminaries in big marble boxes (including, in a surprise to me, the footballer Eusebio), and headed back outside, it had stopped raining.
And so the wandering around continued. There are museums everywhere it would seem. To everything. In fact I think all that is missing is a museum to museums.
We find ourselves back at the river, only to turn and head away from it again and head back towards where we had gotten off the bus this morning on the search for somewhere for us to have our traditional away on holiday curry. There was a detour to find a post office so we could send the postcards we had written earlier.
Still it is trying to rain intermittently. We had seen a potential place on giggle maps and head into an alley off a side street, go up some steps for a change and find the basic looking Nepalese / Indian restaurant.
It may look basic, but the food is amazing, and it is so cheap. Two meals and two drinks each only come to thirty-one Euros. I can see why it is a 4.9 on Trip Advisor. The place is called ODAAN, it is hidden away, but definitely well worth finding.
When we come out the rain has stopped, and the sun is out. There isn’t a cloud in the sky now. And so we head for the Santa Justa lift. As we pass through the square the queue for the 28 tram is as ridiculous as it has been every time we pass here. It may be the iconic symbol of Lisbon tourism, but seriously, who wants to be Lisbon’s favourite dish — sardines — on a tram, hardly able to see out of the windows on the trip up. You’d be far better off having a slow walk up following the tram tracks and being able to see it all.
Having mocked others queuing, there is a queue for the Santa Justa lift, built near the turn of the twentieth century by a disciple of Gustav Eiffel. Only one of the two lifts in its tower are working, but the queue moves quickly enough. It connects the centre of the city with the Bairro Alto high above it.
Once at the top of the lift, the little spiral staircases up to the upper level of the viewing platform are closed, but the views out from lift level are worth the cost of coming up in it.
With the clouds having finally buggered off for the day there are magnificent views out over the city, across to the castle, and down to the river.
And behind it over the Carmel monastery which the exit from the lift takes you past.
It was one of the main flashpoints of the 1974 revolution, and it is a ruin, with little of the roof left on it. Some is used to house a museum. Unusual for Lisbon, I know.
We have been through this area on the bus but find some streets we haven’t been along to walk down (or more accurately at this point up).
The buildings are being lit up, including this theatre bathed in pink light.
There is another viewing point over the city, it is by the top of the funicular we went down in on our first night here. The castle opposite is lit up in green light, but for some reason the camera doesn’t want to know that and will only take the photo with it in an orange glow.
Once you have got past the mass of self-obsessed, selfie taking Instagrammers which plague viewpoints the world over now. Saying that we did try to take a selfie, but the reason we don’t usually take selfies is because we’re both shit at it, and the more photos I seem to have taken of me recently, the more my eyes are changing into the bastard sons of Marty Feldman’s.
The Bairro area is lined with huts serving food and drink and we grab drinks to go and head up roads we’ve been on a tour bus going in the opposite direction to.
I’m still trying to take nighttime shots of interest as we pass.
Helen mentions it would be nice to get some cheese, but there is nowhere open that sells cheese. We see a pharmacy (always a plus), and joke that it should be possible to get cheese on prescription.
We end up on another very steep downhill path, so much so they have made half the footpath into steps. At the bottom it isn’t far to get to the hotel, and time to collapse and rest.
And to try not to think that we have to go home tomorrow.

It was supposed to be a chill walk.
I had Spotify in my ears.Google Maps in my hand.And absolutely no idea where I was going.
Welcome to day 2 of my solo trip.Sunburnt, sleep-deprived, and 100% lost in Lisbon.

I didn’t.
Instead, I kept walking.Up a street that was definitely a hill.Through a park that might’ve been private property.Past a guy yelling at pigeons.
Until I sat on the edge of a fountain, next to a trash can, and cried behind my sunglasses like a drama queen on a budget airline.
I was crying because I was tired of pretending I wasn’t.
Not just that day.In general.

No subscription? Read it here.
We went to The Obsidian Room near the river to celebrate closing the Lisbon project.
No pricing anywhere. Dark wooden panels. Thick white tablecloths. Everything was heavy. Even the metal-sleeved menus.
Hugh was there with a few others from the team. My team. A couple of the finance lot joined. The rest were clients who’d flown over from the States.
There was champagne on arrival. Everyone was shaking hands, swapping cards, patting backs. All smiles now that it was over and I’d made them look good.
When we sat, one of the Americans started a speech in my honour. I bowed my head. Humble.
He raised his glass. “To Lisbon.”
Caught Hugh watching me, just for a second. I was on top. He knew it. Everyone knew it. He didn’t like it.
I stood, “They said it couldn’t be done. But I didn’t listen.”
A few cheers.
“You’ve still never beaten me on the courts, though!” Hugh was grinning over his glass.
A few polite chuckles. His way of getting one over me.
“No,” I grinned back, “but you’ve never beaten Lisbon.”
Raucous laughter. That shut him up.

The light lingered, warm against the cold marble arcs of the quiet convent, as I walked in. As my eyes wandered along the neat rows of sun chairs, my nose travelled to the long summer evenings of my childhood, that smelled of sweet popcorn and cotton candy.
I had never been to an outdoor cinema before, so when my friend suggested we go, I jumped at the opportunity. Now, standing here, I was glad I did.
The re-run was the 1999 teen comedy, “10 Things I Hate About You”. A classic “chick-flick” which I have admittedly watched several times before. It’s a light-hearted love story that ends well, and gives you the right amount of 90’s nostalgia.
Before you go off questioning my taste in movies, I didn’t decide to spend 10 euros on this particular occasion for the sake of the film in question. I spent the 10 euros for the experience.
And an experience it was.
From the moment we stepped into the soft afternoon glow of Graça, I was already in my own outdoor movie. Like a dream within a dream.

Discussing Azure, blockchains and… machine learning rap
This past week was quite eventful for me. I attended the school-symposium DATA Science 2018 — in (Astro)Particle Physics and the Bridge to Industry (about which which I’ll have a post soon) during the whole week, but on Wednesday I went to Microsoft’s headquarters in Lisbon for the 5th PyData Lisbon Meetup | Special Edition.
It’s impressive that the PyData Lisbon community has already more than 500 members as there had only been four events beforehand (the first one in last September). The fifth meetup had 200 participants (the maximum that the Microsoft’s auditorium would allow) and for a good reason: the YouTube phenomenon Siraj Raval was in the house!
But before we met Siraj Raval, there was the talk “We ran out of memory” by Silvio Rodrigues and Tim Kock, two of the founders of Jungle AI, a young startup specialized in predictive intelligence. It dealt with machine learning at scale, using the Azure cloud platform by Microsoft to solve problems which cannot be handled by a laptop.
As a beginner in these things, it was fascinating to me to see such large scale machine learning being used in real-world situations. Even though I wasn’t able to follow every single detail, the informality and joviality of Tim Kock kept me engaged in the presentation.
After a small break for some pizza and beer (thanks Microsoft!), it was time to listen to Siraj Raval, with his presentation “AI Networks”, which you can find in his GitHub. He mostly discussed the next phase of the Web, “Web 3.0”, focusing on blockchain technology and decentralized applications.
I’ve only come across Siraj’s YouTube channel a few months ago while I was searching for videos about machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I was very surprised by the enormous number of subscribers. Who knew so many people would watch videos discussing machine learning algorithms and frameworks?
And apparently some of his early videos had him rapping about these concepts! I hadn’t watched any of them, but Siraj was kind enough to showcase his abilities during the Q&A. I confess that that was not what I was expecting to see when I went to this meetup.
Overall, it was an entertaining evening . If you’d like to check, the event was live streamed on Facebook — and, yes, it includes the rap at the end.

In Lisbon, the soul of the city is written in azulejos. These hand-painted ceramic tiles cover the facades of its oldest buildings, shimmering in sunlight and rain alike, whispering the stories of the city’s past. But walk through Lisbon today, and you’ll notice gaps where tiles once clung — empty spaces on walls like missing teeth in a smile. Construction sites pile broken tiles alongside debris, while sleek new developments encroach on neighborhoods that once hummed with history. It’s here, amid the rubble of modernity, that Serra Behar steps in.
Serra, an artist and a neighbor, isn’t just creating art; she’s waging a quiet, poignant battle to preserve Lisbon’s identity. Her exhibition, Autoimmunity and Allergy, now showing at MAD Gallery, speaks to the fragility of the azulejo, but more importantly, to the fragility of the systems and memories they represent. Each azulejo Serra collects — chipped, cracked, or discarded — is a piece of Lisbon’s story that she refuses to let fade away.
The Artist as Caretaker
For Serra, saving azulejos is an act of care. “Each tile I pick up feels like rescuing a fragment of the city’s memory,” she tells me, her tone both determined and wistful. Her work begins on the streets, where she searches construction sites and demolition zones for tiles that have been cast aside. These aren’t perfect tiles — they’re worn, their colors dulled by time, their edges chipped. But that’s precisely why Serra finds them beautiful.
“They’ve lived,” she says simply. And now, they live again through her art.
At MAD Gallery, her rescued tiles are arranged in installations that feel both meticulous and tender. The rawness of the broken tiles contrasts with the clean gallery space, making the viewer hyperaware of their imperfections. “They’re not supposed to be perfect,” Serra explains. “They’re supposed to remind us of what’s been lost — and what’s worth saving.”
Saving Lisbon, One Tile at a Time
Lisbon, like many cities, is caught in a paradox. Its history is its greatest asset, but its future is being built at the expense of that history. Serra’s work grapples with this tension. Through her art, she shows how azulejos — these seemingly small, decorative objects — are, in fact, vital to the city’s identity.
The azulejo is more than an aesthetic flourish; it’s a language. Its patterns and colors speak of Portugal’s Moorish past, its maritime adventures, its religious traditions, and its modernist movements. But when these tiles are removed, the city loses a piece of its voice. The smooth, glassy surfaces of new construction might glimmer, but they are mute.
Serra’s mission is to give those missing tiles a voice again. By presenting them as art, she forces us to see them not as relics but as witnesses. Each crack and chip becomes a story: of the artisan who painted it, the wall it adorned, and the generations who passed by it on their way to somewhere else.
The Skin of the City
Serra’s exhibition title, Autoimmunity and Allergy, is not a metaphor she chose lightly. She compares the removal of azulejos to a skin condition, where the protective outer layer is damaged, leaving what lies beneath exposed and vulnerable. “Tiles are the skin of buildings,” she says. “They protect the structure, but they also define its character. When you strip them away, you expose scars — not just physical scars, but cultural ones.”
Her metaphor extends further. Just as the body can attack itself in autoimmune diseases, cities, too, can turn on themselves. In the rush to modernize, Lisbon has unwittingly destroyed parts of itself, sacrificing its unique character for the sake of progress. Serra’s work asks a pressing question: Can we find a way to modernize without erasing? Can Lisbon save itself from itself?
A Quiet Resistance
There is a quiet, almost subversive quality to Serra’s art. She isn’t staging protests or writing manifestos. Instead, she’s walking the streets of her city, rescuing one azulejo at a time. Each piece she collects is a small act of defiance, a refusal to let history be discarded like construction waste.
At MAD Gallery, this resistance is palpable. The tiles are displayed not as ornaments but as artifacts. Serra has stripped them of their original context, forcing the viewer to consider their fragility and their significance. Some are arranged to emphasize their broken edges, others are mounted to reveal the raw, unglazed sides that were never meant to be seen. It’s as if the tiles themselves are saying, “Look at me. Remember me.”
The Power of One
In a city as vast and complex as Lisbon, the idea of saving it one azulejo at a time might seem quixotic. But Serra believes in the power of small, deliberate acts. “You don’t save a city all at once,” she says. “You save it piece by piece, memory by memory, tile by tile.”
Her work resonates not because it offers grand solutions but because it reminds us of the importance of paying attention. It’s easy to overlook the cracks in a facade or the gap where a tile used to be. But Serra’s art asks us to slow down, to notice, and to care.
An Invitation to See
As I left MAD Gallery, I found myself looking at Lisbon differently. I noticed the patterns on the azulejos of buildings I’d passed a hundred times without a second thought. I noticed where tiles were missing and where new ones had been added in their place. I noticed, too, the scaffolding that seemed to creep further into the city with every passing month.
Serra’s work had done what all great art should: it had changed the way I saw the world. And it had given me a simple but profound reminder — that saving a city isn’t just the work of governments or preservation societies. It’s the work of individuals, of neighbors like Serra, who care enough to save a single azulejo from being forgotten.
For those who haven’t yet visited Autoimmunity and Allergy, I urge you to go. And when you do, take a moment to reflect on the azulejos you see — or don’t see — on your way there. Each one is a fragment of Lisbon’s story, waiting to be noticed, remembered, and, perhaps, saved.

Ah, November in Lisbon, Portugal — what an exciting time!
Now, I’m not just talking about those amazing sunsets, the delicious food, or the stunning buildings and hidden gems scattered around the city.
No, I’m here for something special: the Web Summit.
This massive tech conference is one of the biggest in the world.
It’s a place where you get to learn so much and meet all these amazing people from everywhere, all passionate about technology just like us.
While this year’s attendance wasn’t my first, it was, once again, an amazing experience.
When you attend a conference alongside 70,000+ people, your perspective changes.
Definitely, at one point I felt overwhelmed.
As I took in the surroundings, I considered the newcomers to this impressive conference and the questions likely swirling in their minds:
After pondering these questions, I decided to share a few words about my experience at the Web Summit in Lisbon and offer tips to help others feel more confident at similar events.
No one should leave such events with negative feelings about their participation or a sense of unproductivity. With some preparation, events like the Web Summit can unfold numerous opportunities.
I hope this article will guide you the next time you attend a large event, as it reflects what I wish I had known before going to my first major gathering.
Many Web Summit attendees are first-timers, and it’s crucial to acknowledge this. Beginners might feel overwhelmed in the fast-paced atmosphere and face common challenges of large events, making navigation seem daunting. With 70,000 participants, the event’s sheer size might lead some to dismiss it prematurely as not worthwhile.
However, I challenge that perspective. Events such as the Web Summit offer a phenomenal platform for learning and networking with influential folks from all over the world.
Still, first things first: your journey at Web Summits starts with your phone.
To maximize your benefit from the event, keep a few things in mind. First, make sure to download the event app, but be cautious about its potential drawbacks. While it provides maps, attendee lists, and other details, filtering people or presentations for specific niche topics of interest might be challenging.
Also, carefully consider how much you’ll rely on the app for networking because it is not primarily designed to facilitate engagement beyond the chat feature.
Consider in such an environment: how likely is it that those you message will respond?
Drawing from my personal experience: use the app for navigation, but avoid relying solely on it for engaging with people.
With numerous presentations occurring at the same time, it’s challenging to keep up with all of them. The venue is filled with ongoing presentations requiring constant movement.
In my view, the source matters more than the topic. A captivating title doesn’t guarantee the presenter’s relevance to the subject. I prefer finding relevant people and attending their presentations, regardless of the topic. Feel free to skip some sessions, as content is often repeated.
Consider your participation in the Web Summit as an investment. Approach it with curiosity and passion, asking questions and challenging ideas. Stay open to your peers’ ideas, as there are valuable learning opportunities. Strive to gain something from each presentation session, as this investment will yield dividends over time.
Friendly tip: Web Summit is packed with sessions, events, keynotes, and workshops. Prioritize the ones you can’t miss and plan your schedule accordingly.
And remember: no matter how hard you try, you’ll not be able to attend everything and be everywhere.
My next piece of advice is to schedule meetings in advance if possible.
This is the pre-event preparation phase I mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that first-time attendees may be eager to attend presentations and explore the venue, but meeting with the right people is crucial.
The people you meet at Web Summit could be your future partners, mentors, or investors.
You’ll only have one chance to make a fine first impression.
Friendly tip: At events like Web Summit, excellent opportunities often arise unexpectedly! Don’t hesitate to talk to unfamiliar faces and explore beyond your usual interests. You might uncover something surprising.
A key lesson from my experiences at Web Summit is the value of side events. They’re smaller, and more intimate, and people tend to prioritize building meaningful relationships. Also, make sure to have fun in the evenings. Many see Web Summit as a tech event that doubles as a big party, and there’s some truth to that.
The most valuable connections often happen when people are at ease.
Trust me on this one: feel free to miss a scheduled session for a lively discussion or a significant announcement happening elsewhere. Stay flexible, trust your instincts, and take advantage of chances to talk whenever they come up. Whether it’s a coffee break or waiting for a keynote speech, these unplanned interactions can lead to valuable new contacts.
Web Summit offers unique opportunities to network with individuals you might not have met elsewhere, such as an entrepreneur from Brazil, an investor from Costa Rica, or a remarkable founder from Japan.
Friendly tip: Don’t just focus on sales at Web Summit. Meet people, have engaging questions ready, and show genuine interest in their stories.
Remember Dale Carnegie’s advice: to be interesting, be interested.
If you have a goal for attending the Web Summit, make sure to plan accordingly.
For instance, if your goal is to generate leads or secure funding, take the time to prepare your pitch and craft effective conversation starters.
Also, decide where to focus your time to connect with the right people.
Your goal should determine your tactics.
Copying what everyone else is doing won’t lead to exceptional results.
Friendly tip: Bring plenty of business cards and prepare a concise elevator pitch about yourself and your business/interests. Nobody will dedicate an hour to intros, as time is a precious asset at the Web Summit — use it wisely.
My personal favorite spots:
Stepping into the vibrant world of events such as the Web Summit, it’s crucial to remember that balance is key. If you’ve reached this point, one thing is clear:
There is a lot to think about.
While the conference offers an ocean of opportunities, your success will rely on your ability to prepare and engage purposefully. Simultaneously, stay open to spontaneous connections and seize opportunities on the spot.
You know why you’re attending.
You’re there for a reason.
Keep an open mind and stay curious — a seasoned conference-goer knows it’s the unplanned conversations and unexpected learning opportunities that often create remarkable insights.
Most importantly, enjoy the process. Embrace the grandness of everything, the dynamics, as well as the rollercoaster of ideas and conversations.
After all, the true essence of large-scale events lies in the vast opportunities right in front of you.
Hope to see you next year in Lisbon!

Somewhere new for us to visit. I had been trying to find a location which would hopefully be warm in April and which neither of us had been to before, and being practical, somewhere which was a direct flight away from Gatwick. I was surprised by just how many places that ruled out. And how many places in Spain and Italy are code shared by BA ad require a change of plane along the way.
So I came up with Lisbon. Lots of variables around the dates, leave years, other events we were going to, and so on. So much so the fact that we were going during the week before Easter and all the kids would be off school passed me by completely.
It was a nice, civilised time for the easyJet flight from Gatwick to Lisbon, relatively painless apart from the ten-minute bus journey from the plane in the middle of a field somewhere to the terminal building. The Lisbon metro from the airport was straightforward. And the art in the stations was fascinating, if only I hadn’t got the camera buried away in my bag.
We popped out of the metro station, and it was two minutes to the hotel. For a change it isn’t an IHG one, as they were either in remote locations, or ridiculously expensive and had no points nights available for the four nights we were going to be here. So it is a random Booking.com hotel. Which looks decent enough in the lobby, but they are doing improvements on it. With it being a Booking.com choice we are in a before room. Which very much has an eighties Marbella vibe about it. But it is clean and has a comfy bed and its not like we’ll be spending much time outside of sleeping in it anyway. We’re going to be too busy being out exploring. Which after dumping the bags we were. It was a literal dump and run, no unpacking.
A bit of late lunch and we are off wandering down the city’s main boulevard heading towards the river. There is a market down one side of the boulevard, which we aren’t going to be distracted by, it isn’t a shopping trip. Besides aiming for the river there is no plan.
But as any regular reader will know we are easily distracted and tend to detour off at the slightest whim. There is no master plan for the trip as neither of us had looked at the guidebooks until we were on the plane. Though we have booked the standard hop on hop off bus tickets. As when don’t we?
The detouring didn’t take long to kick in as we saw a funicular off down a side street just a short walk from the main boulevard, and we headed over there for a ride up the side of the hill.
Lisbon is remarkably hilly, and most of them are steep. On the metro journey into the centre there were a couple of times where we popped out from being underground and suddenly found ourselves on a bridge over a valley before popping back into another tunnel.
Anyway, at the top of this funicular run is a short walk to gardens with views out over a lot of the city.
Next to the top of the funicular track is a building with an interesting tower and a spiral staircase up to the top. From which the views would be even better (even if it would be no good for my vertigo), but there is no public entrance to it. So we go back down and rejoin the main drag to get to the river.
A lot of the city was destroyed by a major earthquake in 1755, so most of the lower part of the city leading to the river was rebuilt in the late eighteenth century in a grid pattern, following what they had seen in Paris. They have managed to shoehorn some modern monstrosities in as they do everywhere, but there are some splendid examples of early twentieth century Art Deco buildings plugged into gaps as well.
They quite like a square here. There are some vast open paved spaces which we pass through on the way to the river.
And they certainly like a big old statue. A lot of the time it is a figure high up in the air at the top of a tall column, or as I got to be calling them as the trip went on, ‘another bloke on a stick.’
Anywhere they have a square, or a wide pavement, then they have cafes and restaurants spilling out into them. We are not going to struggle to find somewhere to eat on this trip.
Along one such alfresco dining mecca on a pedestrianised street we can see the grand archway becoming larger with each footstep.
Once through it, would you believe it, we are in another huge square. With a fountain in the middle (they do love a fountain, although not many of them have the water running), and on the other side of the square is the River.
It is the River Tagus (which I’m sure sees lots of people doing a tag us in post on social media), or as they call it in Lisbon the Tejo. At this point it is more like an inland bay. The channel which heads out west from here is wide enough, the massive suspension bridge shows that, but here it is more like being at the coast with it being the sea between you and another country. But it isn’t, that is still Portugal out over the other side of the expanse.
The sun is shining, it is a leisurely late Sunday afternoon and so we stroll along the banks of the river following the sun in going to the west, looking for somewhere to get refreshment. There are stalls along the front. The trend would very much appear to be to pina coladas served in hollowed out pineapples. A bar has a DJ playing next to the water, and in yet another square there is a live band playing traditional Portuguese music.
We find a café on the waterfront near the ferry port (for crossing the inland bay to the cities on the south of the river) in the sun and have drinks. The coffee looks amazing and tasted even better.
It is relaxing watching the people and the variety of boats going by.
We like it so much we stop there to have food. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a menu where one of the dishes have proclaimed themselves as being spiritual, but there on the menu is Spiritual Cod, which Helen ended up ordering.
It didn’t come with enlightenment or a prayer book, just in a dish looking like it was Cod Mornay.
Whilst sat outside the restaurant, another couple on the end table tried to spirit themselves away without paying, but the eagle-eyed staff noticed and ran after them, card machine in hand and got them to cough up what they had tried to avoid paying.
The sun is all but gone by the time we move on. We find we are close to the Time Out Market, so we have a wander through it to have a look. It is full and buzzy with lots of food options and certainly somewhere to think about coming back to on another evening.
We are now heading in the vague direction of the hotel. There are more squares. Buildings are being lit up. There are lots of interesting vehicles trying to entice tourists in for tours. And there are more steep uphill roads to walk up. That is the thing with guidebook maps. They show the roads and the direction they go in, but there is no mention or indication of the elevation of said roads.
After going up for what seems like a long time, we find ourselves at the top of the route of a different funicular. A quick check shows it goes down to the main drag we have walked along from the hotel earlier in the day, so we hop on.
We did know we had been going uphill for quite some time since leaving the banks of the river, but it is a surprise just how far we had climbed as the funicular ride down took a lot longer than we had imagined it would, and than the earlier one had.
When we had been going in the opposite direction earlier, the side of the road we walk along now had been full of market stalls, but they have all packed up and gone, only to leave behind the occasional café or restaurant which had been disguised by the surrounding stalls earlier.
There are lots of billboards up around the city as there had been when we were in Budapest, as there are elections on the way. I know it isn’t the correct interpretation, but I’m not sure I would be voting for someone with a slogan of Zero Future.
What had been intended to be a quick mooch about became six hours. Six very enjoyable hours, but now bed, and rest is calling us as there will be a lot more hours, so much more to see, and difficult food choices to be made for the next four days to come.

Of course, Hybrid Work is not only a campaign to us. Therefore, we want to introduce you to our colleagues that work from everywhere as digital nomads for diconium. Read further to see how Verena experienced her workation in beautiful Lisbon.
“Oh, you worked from Lisbon?” That was a common response to my explanation that I didn’t take a six-month sabbatical in Portugal, but simply moved the home office to the sun.
But back to the beginning: in October 2021, I took my first workation. Two weeks in Portugal — first Lisbon, then Porto — together with my colleague Lena. And that’s when a thought came up: Why not just stay longer? No sooner said than done. At the end of February 2022, it was time: I said goodbye to Stuttgart and boarded a plane heading south. Looking forward to warm spring days, lots of sun and much better weather than in Germany. Nice dream. It may sound surprising, but it also rains in Lisbon. A lot. Until April. But hey, somehow it was still nice to spend this “April weather” somewhere else.

Why Lisbon, you might ask yourselves? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city where you can find everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses, a thriving nightlife, the most beautiful beaches within reach, good restaurants and cafes, relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life. Oh yes, of course we also have an office there. Little has changed in my day-to-day work. The same projects, the same colleagues, even before mostly remote — now I just had to get up an hour earlier. But it still felt easier.
“Why Lisbon, actually? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city that has everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses…relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life.”
The positive attitude towards life and the joy that this city carries also has a positive effect on my work. I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days. Lisbon simply invites you to leave the house also later in the evening, because there is so much to discover and see. And bang — it’s the weekend again. And in good Portuguese style, you simply enjoy it on the beach. You don’t need a vacation for that, it’s just a normal Saturday. Crazy, isn’t it?
“I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days.”
But I want to share something else: The biggest learning for me was how much I miss the physical meetings with my colleagues (even though I can’t count on one hand how many of them made a trip to Lisbon during my stay). Especially after things became a bit more open and dynamic again after two years remote work, I felt like I was stuck in the pandemic for even longer in my daily work life in Lisbon. Although I visited the Lisbon office, I did not meet my colleagues I’m directly working with. Therefore, every visit I made to our offices in Germany during this time showed me again how valuable these face to face interactions are — both on a human level and for the project progress. Just locking yourself and your team in a room for half a day helps move the project forward. And honestly? As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues again regularly.
“As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues regularly.”
Don’t get me wrong, there’s something about sitting in a café on the beach and working from there — provided the internet connection is stable and the noise level is kept in check. Big shoutout to Teams for providing virtual backgrounds! That’s why I’m already very excited about where I’ll be going next and for how long. Because there is no doubt that I’ll be on another Workation. But in the end it is always nice to come back home.

In my previous article for Live View, I discussed the cameras I decided to bring along on a trip my wife and I planned for six months or more. The trip would start from Lisbon, voyage briefly to Tangiers, and then cruise along the coast of Andalusia to Barcelona. I wanted to travel light but be prepared to do justice to the places I would be seeing for the first, and possibly only, time.
Now we are in the midst of that trip. This article is a report on how things have worked out so far for me and my photography, as illustrated by what I saw in Lisbon.
To recap, I brought two cameras, my OM Systems OM-1 and my new Fuji X100VI. For the OM-1, I took two lenses — the 12–100mm F/4 and the 8–25mm F/4. At the last minute, I decided to take my 18mm conversion lens for the X100VI, and I’m glad I did. I originally thought that the OM-1 would be fine for all focal lengths, but it turns out that the X100VI with the wide conversion lens is great for small city streets.
Which I used more. On various tours over three days, including dark interiors and bright streets, I used whichever camera seemed appropriate — I carried both. Counting the results, it turns out I used both cameras equally. Six hundred thirty images with the Fuji, 680 for the OM.
When it came to focal lengths, it turns out I used the Fuji with the wide converter 56% of the time —…

Going down for breakfast we were able to get what looked to be the last two free seats in the restaurant. I’m looking down the room thinking it is rammed and being surprised as it wouldn’t appear the hotel is that big. But there is a mirror across the back of the room, so it looks twice the size with twice the people in it, and it was only my third wander around the room before I nearly walked into myself coming the other way and realised what was going on. (Have I said I’m not a morning person?)
I suppose it could be said I’m the weather jinx. The previous afternoon had been warm, so this morning I leave the hotel in shorts, t-shirt, and wearing sunglasses. So of course by the time we got on the first of the tour buses it was overcast and threatening to rain. If I said it was a little changeable during the day it might just about cover the number of times we changed seats, got undercover, back into the open, back undercover, in the open, downstairs, upstairs, downstairs, on and off.
When the sun did break through it was lovely and warm, but on the second of the three bus tour routes the spit spots turned into a torrential downpour, which coincided with exactly where we had planned to get off the bus and explore on foot.
As with many larger cities there are more than one route of HOHO buses in Lisbon. There are lots of places of interest to see, but they are spread out over a wide area, putting them all on one route would mean an exceedingly long bus tour.
We had decided on the blue route first which was more to the east and north of the city. Besides the grand municipal buildings and old churches it is interesting as to what catches the eye when on the tours. Such as the sex shop in a building with an Art Deco female fresco on the wall.
Or the Lisbon Business Centre being in a low rent run down block with ideas above its station.
The name of an ice cream store.
Or even the former gas storage frames.
The route goes through the part of the city which had regeneration for when Lisbon hosted Expo 1998. And there are some very interesting structures to see.
There is always too much to try and take in and with the speed of travel, or the angle you are at on the bus means that I spend a lot of time when back at home wondering what the hell I was trying to take a photo of.
What is not in any doubt is just how steeply undulating the city is. There are a lot of roads the buses go up which I’d not want to attempt driving a car, especially the angle of some of the red light induced hill starts which would be needed.
After a lap of the blue route, we change to the red route, getting part of the way around before the rain forced us downstairs for cover, fortunately picking seats which weren’t still getting leaked on down there. The viewpoint behind raindrop splattered windows is totally different and the opportunity to take photographs is limited. To zero.
We got off where we had planned to at the Jeronimos Monastery, supposedly where the first Pastel de Natas were ever made. It is in a traffic free zone (apart from the tour buses), and it is surrounded by museums. (And parts of the monastery buildings have been converted into museums.)
It is properly tipping it down and so we head into a packed Maritime Museum café for lunch. There are map related items to buy in the gift shop, without having to go into the museum, so always good. And whilst we had been lunching the rain had stopped and the sun was trying to escape the cloud cover.
Only for the rain to come back the moment we step outside. But we are used to rain, and we carry on and have a mooch about, through gardens, under the road and railway and to the riverbank and the immense Monument to the Discoveries on it.
In front of it in the square is a map of the world and on it are places highlighted with dates of when the Portuguese empire arrived there during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries following the footsteps of its famed explorers Vasco de Gama and Ferdinand Magellan.
We are heading back under the road and rail when Helen feels someone close up behind her. There is a woman pawing at her backpack and saying, ‘sorry it was open.’ It most definitely wasn’t the woman was blatantly trying to rob Helen. Fortunately, the front pocket was only full of tissues, and her phone and purse were at the bottom of the main compartment buried under lots of other stuff like a jumper and scarf. But whilst checking there was nothing missing the woman and her sidekick had scuttled off as fast as they could and were nowhere to be seen when we were back up at street level. The would-be thief may have got fuck all, but it did shake Helen up and meant she was reluctant to use the backpack as a backpack for the rest of the day and was ultra wary about anyone being close behind her at all.
It began to brighten as we continued to wander around Belem, but we didn’t stop and pick the bus back up at the same point, instead we ended up walking back towards the large suspension bridge.
This meant a detour over a footbridge spanning the road and railway and out onto the roof of one of the MAAT buildings, giving a good view of the other older one.
And of the suspension bridge, built to look like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, it is painted in the same plum colour paint (which is the best colour to be seen in the fog), but is a bit shorter.
Behind it on the hill on the south of the river is the statue Christ the King, like a smaller version of Christ the Redeemer in Rio, more like Christ the Reduced. They do like a copy.
The bridge is called the April 25th Bridge, a nod to the 1974 revolution. It had been shrouded in mist when we had come past it on the bus earlier.
We walked back to under the bridge before reacquainting ourselves with the HOHO bus tours, retracing part of the route we had done before (downstairs in the dry at the time), and past the Belem tower.
Another shower forced us back undercover, and moving back out from the cover just happened to coincide with passing the Basilica, one of the more spectacular churches of the city, and I missed the chance to get a photo of it completely.
Before the loop was complete, we jumped off to change to the green route for a couple of stops to get us up the steep narrow winding streets to the castle. It is easy to see why this route uses a minibus. The route certainly makes me want to reiterate my reluctance to ever want to drive on these streets in a car.
The plan is to get to the castle so that we can catch the 5pm walking tour included with the HOHO tickets. Which we just about manage.
The tour guide in Guilherme, and he is from Brazil, and is doing the tour in English and Spanish, which just blows my mind as I can only just about manage the one language, and even that needs to be carried around in a bucket most of the time.
From the high point next to the castle entrance we have a slow meander down to the river stopping at key points to have things pointed out and for little pieces of the history of the city imparted to us.
One is at the statue of St Vincent (patron saint of the city),
And the viewpoint down from the plaza there, over the terracotta roofs to the river, and across to the church of St Vincent on another hill,
And the dome of the National Pantheon housed in a former church.
We pass a tree which looks like it roots have escaped from the soil and are on an acid trip induced adventure.
There is a quick poke inside the cathedral (which we are likely to return to later in the week).
And then it is down to the river side, stopping at the spiky house.
And finally into the Commerce Square in front of the grand arch, which we had passed through on our little stroll the evening before.
It was a good tour, lasting a lot longer than the advertised hour, and there was even a recommendation of a post tour restaurant for dinner. Which had massive portions of lovely food at reasonable prices. Such sized portions it was probably a good idea there was a walk back up to the hotel involved afterwards.
Those twelve hours had flown by. Time for rest and to get ready to do it all again tomorrow. More buses and a boat tour to come.

There are few things more iconic than leaving rainy London in search of sunnier skies — only to land in Portugal to find… more rain.
Welcome to Lisbon, land of seven hills, centuries of charm, and one of the soggiest weekends I’ve ever had. And somehow, it was still magical.
We arrived bright-eyed, hopeful, and wildly underdressed. The UK, of course, had decided to be 22°C and sunny that weekend, while Lisbon greeted us with a torrential downpour.
After squelching to our hotel, Portobay Liberdade, we regrouped and, now lightly towel-dried, swam our way to a nearby Italian spot (Il Basilico, I think?) for a bite. My travel companion’s trainers were instantly soaked, turning a casual stroll into a mission: Operation Waterproof Shoe Hunt.
Easier said than done. Lisbon’s got many things — views, wine, vintage tiles, but trainers shops? Not in a monsoon.
That first day? Honestly, a washout. But then, we stumbled into dinner. And let me tell you, it was a revelation.
After drying off from our soggy adventures, we chose to dine in our hotel that night at Bistro 6, and it was one of the most fantastic choices we made. The duck was remarkable: Crispy on the outside, tender and rich on the inside, with a wonderful depth of flavour present in every bite. It was so good that even in a city as full of culinary gems as Lisbon, we couldn’t resist going back for round two. I’m pretty sure I’ll be daydreaming about that plate for years to come.
By morning, we gave in to our fate. Lisbon was going to soak us, and we were going to like it. Jackets on, umbrellas up (luckily supplied by the hotel), optimism renewed.
First stop: the Mercado da Ribeira (aka Time Out Market Lisbon). Our first-ever Time Out Market and it set the bar high. It wasn’t your typical chaotic food court, instead, it felt like a well-curated space with an incredible variety of options. From fresh seafood and gourmet croquettes to decadent handmade chocolates, there was something for every craving. The place was organised yet vibrant, buzzing with energy.
If you’re new in town, it’s the perfect place to meet people: everyone sits together, it’s lively, communal, and thriving.
We grabbed a doughnut (incredible!!), a couple of coffees, then wandered through the traditional market tucked behind the main hall. Fishmongers shouting, locals shopping, fruit stacked high, there was a real sense of the city coming to life. We were completely captivated.
Next, we set off to see Lisbon Cathedral (Sé) and try our luck with Tram 28, Lisbon’s charmingly vintage and famously packed transit option. While we waited in the drizzle, we were approached by a charismatic Parisian tour guide, offering a covered tuk-tuk ride through the city.
Usually, we’d run from that kind of pitch, but he had a roof, plastic sides, and an irresistible charm. Reader, we climbed aboard.Best decision of the trip.
He took us through the seven hills of Lisbon, shared history with passion, pointed out hidden spots we’d never have found on our own, and gave us time to really enjoy the views, not just tick them off a list.
Oh, and at our very first miradouro (viewpoint), someone proposed right next to us. Cue tears. Lisbon, suddenly, wasn’t just rainy — it was romantic.
We ended the day at Praça do Comércio, where the weather finally gave us a break. Picture this: three grand golden-yellow façades on three sides…and then, nothing. Just open sky and the wide, rolling Tagus River, looking more like a calm ocean than a river. It was one of the most unexpectedly stunning squares I’ve ever stood in.
With a glass of wine in hand and the wind finally drying our coats, we toasted to Lisbon’s stubborn beauty.
Sunday morning brought us to Belém — land of custard tarts and monumental queues. Our attempt to visit Jerónimos Monastery failed (read: misunderstood the queue and were politely turned away), but fate had better plans: we headed early to Pastéis de Belém instead.And thank everything holy we did.
This place is a Lisbon legend. From the outside, it looks like a pleasant café. But inside? It’s a labyrinth of awning-covered rooms, waiters by the dozen, and pastries by the thousands. Somehow, we snagged a table.
Between the two of us, we ordered at least six pastries — custards, almond cakes, an orange thing I can’t explain — and two coffees. The bill? €10 total. I don’t know how. I don’t care. I would’ve paid triple.
We even brought some back to the UK with us. That’s how good they were.
We wandered through Alfama and Old Town Lisbon on our last day, taking in the steep streets, the tiled walls, the laundry flapping above us. If I can give you one travel tip for Lisbon, it’s this:
Do not come with a new hip. Or bad knees. Or any aversion to steep climbs.Lisbon is beautifully vertical. Like, mountain goat vertical. My poor mum (fresh from hip surgery) was a trooper, but fair warning: this city is cardio with a capital C.
So, was it the sun-soaked European weekend I imagined? No.Was it a glorious, rain-drenched, pastry-fueled, unexpectedly beguiling adventure? Absolutely.
Lisbon is a city that sneaks up on you. It’s tiled facades and rooftop views, ghost stories in ancient cathedrals, and secret tarts tucked in glass counters. It’s fascinating markets and quiet moments, and unexpected friendships with French tuk-tuk drivers.
It’s a city I’ll absolutely come back to, preferably with better footwear, a lighter raincoat, and the same appetite for surprises.

I love reading fiction, writing when the mood strikes, and pottering outside when the sun comes out. Love art, travel, and catching a West End show when I can.

Having been woken up by an unpleasant noise I hear every morning Monday through Friday, I peeked at the darkness still reluctant to get up and saw nothing but furniture shapes. This time, I was quite thrilled to kick off the day because in just a few hours I would walk the streets of a city I never thought I’d visit.
Fast forward a couple of hours, a few airport checks and check-ins and one transit flight and I was finally there. Oh yes, and my arm was sore from carrying a few suitcases (thanks to my girlfriend), with that feeling of exhaustion as if coming home after a whole day’s work and a mediocre meal and no leg space for a 190-cm guy which caused me to twist and turn in my seat. But that’s the economy class ticket benefit you don’t get anywhere else. It is the airport company’s fault but I do often get — “Well, why are you that tall?”
Other than these minor inconveniences, the flight was good. I was here. Stepping out of the plane and walking for a change was a true remedy. I heard a whispering “Thank you” from my back and knees as I was willowing towards an airport exit.
Outside, palm trees dwarfed every building around it as they stood proudly, defying gravity. Above, the clear sky was chasing away the dark clouds that gathered in the night to water the city. They knew Lisbon was awaiting guests. The air was quite refreshing and it filled my lungs with energy after every breath. Comparing it to the cold Belgrade air, which is best felt with the scarf wrapped around your mouth, was pointless. It was a true marathon to get to the destination, yet I was more than eager to get the tour started. I couldn’t wait to see what the city had to offer.
The spring sun was shining bright. It is one of those days where you take your jacket with you, but it is warm enough during the day and you don’t need it. If you sit down, you can feel the wind creeping up your shirt sleeves, giving you goosebumps. So with my jacket on and off and on and off again, I was strolling the old parts of Lisbon.
Each building, house and structure of any kind, whether historical or not was a story for itself thanks to the bright blue, yellowish and white tiles covering it. The tiles, called azulejos, were used as decoration, but also to protect the buildings from the salty river and ocean air. It is the first thing that catches the eye, together with different kinds of tiles laid under your feet. Those painted pictures of ships, seas, winds and other things on the squares, streets, and sidewalks.
Walking through the city street I was faced with the dilemma to look down and up, as vibrant colors were everywhere with tiles reflecting the sun, giving you the warm and cozy feeling of familiarity and admiration.
It took me a while to fight against the hilly terrain to get to what I consider to be the main square — Praca do Comercio. It offers a marvelous view of the Tagus river which shows its full power exactly at this place, pushing the coast to the sides, stretching out as much as possible. One might be tricked to consider this to be the sea, partly due to the pleasant breeze coming at you. However, it is just the spot where you can see the full power and potential of nature, as the river narrows down a bit further “down the road” before it collides with the vastness of the cold and blue Atlantic. Seagulls are flying around, their song mixing with the people murmur and tram’s racket.
A few tiny white sails were seen on the river, while across, the remaining parts of the city are calling you to explore them, with much more greenery and sparse buildings.
The welcoming atmosphere invites you to sit on the curb, even in one of the surrounding cafes and just soak in everything around you. And that’s what I did. The sounds, the smells the view. It is all one needs to know about a city to recognize its soul, and it didn’t take me long to see Lisbon as my own.
As the sun retreats, the tiredness due to miles of walking and exploring caught up with me again, but just like upon the arrival, it was mixed with pleasure and peace.
And the sunsets…true Lisbon colors show up, the ones you cannot see during the day. With the remains of the day, the rush is over and satisfaction is painted on every face you encounter, tourist or local.
Sleep catches with you quickly when you lie down. I cannot remember what happened, but it was morning again. And that awful alarm sound, although it felt better this time. Getting down to the hotel lobby by elevator felt a bit painful due to aching in my legs, yet there was no choice. The city was calling me out to turn every corner, see every tile and smell the air from hills and valleys.
Alfama is a city within a city. I decided to walk across it and it was a mistake from the start. Uphill and downhill terrain made this area specific, with no flat parts. To me, it all seemed uphill, especially after a few hours. Luckily, you can get on the vintage yellow tram which is one of the symbols of the city and ride up, before you get off and walk uphill. Again. Endless elevation. And just like the other areas, Alfama is colorful and vibrant but there’s something special about it, something mysterious that I couldn’t define.
My stomach started complaining, which meant that the entire itinerary changed and the first place I wanted to get to was the restaurant. Suddenly, all those historical places became “meh” as human biology stepped in.
Lisbon is a perfect city for fish lovers. Fish is all over the menus and all I desired at that point was salmon — and boy, oh boy, it was terrific. Add a squeeze of lemon on top of it, with a fresh salad as the side dish and it is a perfect combination. No bones to pick just a light yet fulfilling meal.
While all of that was happening, a fado trio was playing the background, a local band, performing here and there, and it was all that was missing. They hit the right note as the sun was setting over Alfama.
The moment I landed at the Belgrade airport, I was happy to be home, yet sadness filled my inner being. The city was grey and colorless, with people rushing all over the place, going in the wrong direction. It was cold outside and the cold reached all the way to my bones. I already missed the sunny hillsides and building tops, the uneven grounds and the atmosphere which seemed to be more welcoming.
I was back in my everyday routine. Yet, on every cloudy and misty day, I remember the Lisbon sun, shining bright!
Until we meet again!

With the sun beating down on me and a temperature of over 28°C, I see a fellow runner lying on the curb being attended to by first responders. I check my watch and decide to stop once again at the next water station. This is going to be much tougher than I expected…
My journey to the 2017 Lisbon Marathon started in the winter of 2015. I was busy assembling IKEA furniture when I was struck by a burning pain in my knee that refused to go away. For the next few days it continued to get worse and every small stair suddenly became a major challenge. Finally, I decided to see an orthopedist. I never really liked (or had much reason) to see a doctor, but I had just turned 45, my girlfriend Anna was pregnant with our daughter and I figured getting it checked out would be the responsible thing to do.
The visit ended with a referral for an MRI that led to a nasty surprise. The cartilage in my knees was considerably damaged. These injuries had been looming for some time as I continued to ignore the warning signs. The diagnosis was clear. I would now be required to get a sodium hyaluronate injection directly into my knee joints every 6 months just to ease the pain. An injection with a price tag of $750 that isn’t covered by any health insurance. To add insult to injury, the doctor casually said, “Look, you may be able to go for a 5-kilometer jog, and you should do that regularly, but nothing longer. Take it easy, you will never be able to run a marathon, so don’t bother trying.” These comments resonated in me for a long time. I never even considered running a marathon — until this very moment.
I have always seen myself as a member of the running community, but frankly, my laps through the park had become less frequent over the years. There was the occasional spring onset of daily runs that lasted for about a month, but they were never farther than 5 to 10k. The longest distance I had ever run was a 25k race but that was only once and it was over 20 years ago. So, I could have been content with injections twice a year and back to a rather normal life. Only that I wasn’t.
The most urgent issue I wanted to focus on was the pain. I started reading a lot about treatment options and I decided to try something other than getting needles jammed into my knees. After a bit of experimentation, I found that taking a high dose daily (2000 mg) of glucosamine sulphate was starting to help me. Later, I added omega 3 and collagen to the mix. After a couple of weeks the burning sensation went away. I had indeed found an alternative for my battered knees.
Please bear with me, in one of my former lives I was also a lawyer: This is what worked for me, but no medical advice whatsoever is intended.
The following year I wasn’t really prioritizing my running career. Throughout all of 2016, I covered a total distance of less than 60 km in twelve runs. Yes, I had a lot of other things on my plate, with a newborn baby, being CEO of Berlin’s Innovation Agency and everything else. At least I was sticking to the doctor’s advice when it came to the part of “taking things easy” with my knees. But I had a growing sense that I was missing something. I was somehow able to manage getting everything done — but I was also realizing that I was losing my edge.
New Year’s Eve is always a great time for resolutions. In the years past, I must admit (and you can probably relate), these intentions were rather short-lived. But this time I was hell-bent to make a change for real. So I came up with something that seemed utterly beyond reach: For 2017 I resolved to run a marathon. And to make things more interesting, I didn’t even consider the Berlin Marathon in my hometown. I was looking for a venue with added value. I soon found Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, located at the River Tagus and the Atlantic Ocean, one of the most fascinating cities in Europe. With the race scheduled for October 15th, this would leave me enough time to find out if my knees would keep up with my ambitions.
The first thing I did was to read about marathon training. There are many manuals and programs out there. The takeaway lesson was: Run frequently, consistently including workouts for speed, stamina, and mobility and run a reasonable number of longer runs that should include a 30+ km run in the weeks before the event. This means you must spend a lot of time and you must spend it regularly. Marathon training is an exercise in discipline and commitment, that much I realized. Wait, I only had time for two handfuls of recreational runs in 2016 and (what I thought to be) insufficient sleep due to our baby’s somewhat erratic sleep patterns, a demanding job and, last but not least, a relationship to cherish. Sounds like something straight from the playbook of Mission Impossible, doesn’t it?
Nevertheless, I came up with a plan. I set 2 milestones that would serve as my intermediate goals: The 10k City Night race in Berlin on July 29th along the famous Kurfürstendamm Boulevard and the Stadtlauf Berlin half marathon on August 20th. If I could complete both within a reasonable time and my knees would be functional afterwards I would book the flights to Lisbon. After registering for both races, I started running 5 kilometers on January 3rd along the icy shores of Schlachtensee Lake, which would become my favorite route for the next couple of months.
With the marathon still in the “distant” future, the winter runs that followed were a bit sporadic. Eventually I had to figure out how to fit my training into my daily routine and the only solution I came up with was to get up early. And I mean really early, at 4:30 am.
There has been a lot written about the benefits of starting your day off early and I must say, it’s totally true! Starting your work day after you have spent some time working out is great. Having a daily sense of achievement after logging 10 or 20 km before you start breakfast is truly awesome. Having the chance to focus on your thoughts while enjoying the sunrise is priceless. So, over the next few months, I was running regularly and enjoying the slow and steady progress I was making.
Both tests I recklessly scheduled quite close to the big day went well, so I booked the flights and a very nice apartment in Lisbon’s historic Alfama district. Finally, it was going to happen. I would run at the Lisbon Marathon!
In the final week before the race one issue became increasingly pressing — the weather forecast. When I had the idea of flying to Portugal for my first ever marathon, I of course checked the weather information. On average you can expect 20°C in the middle of October. But not this year, the forecast was 31°C with clear skies. The 2006 Chicago Marathon had to be shut down with the mercury at 28°C but I expected that in sunny Portugal this wouldn’t even be considered. So, I frantically worked on adapting my gear. It is a good thing that you reduce your training miles leading up to the race (a.k.a. tapering), so you can take care of these kinds of things.
However, speaking of reduced miles, another question started nagging me. Did I train enough? Even though I ran nearly every day in the weeks prior to Lisbon, I never ran a distance longer than 25 km. But on the other hand, 15 km was one of my regular morning runs, so the additional stretch should be manageable, right? Since there was no chance I could redo my training plan in the next few days, I decided to relax. The race day would prove if my reasoning was right.
I arrived Thursday evening in Lisbon to acclimate myself and focus on the challenge ahead. It was a luxury to have time to think and I enjoyed doing so at the marathon’s designated finish at Praça do Comércio. Here, you have a wonderful view over River Tagus’ final passage before joining the Atlantic Ocean. It became my “vision quest” as my girlfriend Anna would call it. She has always been supportive of my aspirations. Although we originally planned to make the trip to Lisbon together, Anna decided to stay at home with our young daughter and this gave me the gift of time alone. I used it well and came up with a list of goals and dreams for my future.
Finally, the day of the race dawned and I was sitting on the train from Lisbon to Cascais jammed with marathoners in various degrees of contemplation. Some were sitting on the floor with an empty look on their face, others were chatting happily away with their running buddies or texting home. I was silently rehearsing my game plan: Stick to the well-trained pace of 5:30, don’t get carried away by competing with other runners in the first 20 or so km, pick up the pace at 30 km aiming at a negative split, finish sub 4:00 hours.
And I stuck to the plan, at least for the first 20 km. After crossing the starting line in a wave of euphoria I was soon running steadily. I found the waving flag of the 4 hour pacemaker I was going to follow until the half marathon mark and the first misting station was in sight.
Then something unexpected happened. The heart rate display on my watch jumped to an unreal 202 bpm and I forced myself to slow down. Around 175 bpm would have been the “normal” maximum for a person of my age. Today, looking back at the data, I’m sure that this reading was erroneous because I have never again gone over a 170 bpm. At the time, I only had the information on my display and it had a tremendous impact. I suddenly realized that I still had another half marathon to go and the sun was beating down mercilessly even though it wasn’t even 10 a.m. yet. I checked my knees for any signs of pain or weakness. Had I overestimated myself? How could I have believed that with only months of training I would be able to pull this off? I already envisioned myself collapsing at the roundabout near the beach of Carcavelos.
This was the point where I was (to be honest for the first time really) awestruck by the magnitude of the marathon as a test of body and mind. I considered my options. I could stop now and justify it with the parching heat and my staggering heart rate. But in the end, I decided to follow through, no matter what. My goal had changed. Certainly, I still wanted to finish with a time that would be to the best of my abilities, but I mainly focused on not being defeated. I would slow down, I would drink whenever possible, I would even walk any uphill stretches of the course. The reason I started this endeavor in the first place was to prove to myself that it was still possible to accomplish something really demanding and to push my limits. This would become my mantra for the next kilometers to come.
And those kilometers weren’t easy. In fact, I never experience the famous “runner’s high”, at least not while I was running. The last 10 km became an uncomfortable rhythm of moving along an agonizing 2.5 km stretch only to reach the next water station, drinking and cooling myself, and starting all over again, but it worked. After I had passed the 40 km mark the number of cheering spectators increased significantly. That gave me the final boost to give the backup goal I cooked up with while poking along the torrid Avenida Marginal a try: Finishing at 4:30.
With a final sprint I reached the finish line at 4:30:54!
After hitting the stop button on my sports watch I felt exhausted but otherwise amazingly good. No cramps, no sore muscles even in the days following the race. Interestingly enough, the knees that brought me there also carried me throughout the whole distance without any problems. So, on a physiological level, it is safe to say that the stress I put on my body was easily absorbed.
The marathon had both a short and long term impact on my psychology as well. It all started with the continuous effort I put into my training despite all the seemingly “good” reasons why there wasn’t enough time. Once I made up my mind and committed myself to the marathon, I magically found ways to make it happen. I was able to build up my knees by training and through supplements with no side effects based on the research I did. I was able to regain my confidence and mental strength on a very fundamental level. And I was able to apply all of this to master the challenge the Lisbon Marathon turned out to be.
After I had taken a cold shower in my apartment and devoured a carb-laden lunch, I immediately went back onto the streets of Lisbon for a walk. I noticed a shift in my perspective that is still present today. A lot of things suddenly felt shallow and dispensable, others became much more significant, like sharpening the focus of my mental map. And I started working towards reaching some of the most important goals that I had identified just days before.
So, it once again proves to be true: Every cloud has a silver lining. When I got the news of my supposedly ruined knees, it seemed to be the end of my running days. But instead, this was just the beginning! It has forced me to make decisions about how I want to live my life. I opted for the challenges and that has allowed me to grow beyond my athletic ambitions. You gain nothing by accepting your fate, you must keep on fighting if you want to win.

Lisbon is a city of seven hills. And I am the queen of one of them, for three days. But if I go down a hill, I must climb up again.
The charm of Lisbon is its narrow lanes and endless steps lined by colorful azulejos (tile) covered buildings. The beauty of Lisbon is its hills and plentiful viewpoints with panoramic views. To climb these hills, you’d need good food to fuel your stamina. The good news is, delicious food is everywhere for every budget.
Since we had been to Lisbon once many years ago, this time we decided not to cram a tourist checklist into our three-day stay.
We were first captivated by the sweeping view from Miradouro de Santa Catarina (Viewpoint of Saint Catarina), within a short walk from where we are staying. The grand Tagus River and the red tile roofs beneath glow in the warm sun, and Christ the King statue stands tall in the distance across the river. Both locals and tourists enjoy having a drink at Noobai rooftop bar and restaurant. We didn’t have a chance to catch the sunset there but it is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view. There is also…

When I was first thinking about moving to Germany, the appeal was pretty clear: Germany is an economic powerhouse, one of the strongest economies in the world. I thought to myself, “Okay, if I move there, I’m making a smart decision for my career.” And even though Berlin wasn’t exactly my first choice, I figured it would work as a starting point.
Fast forward six years, and I’m feeling stuck both personally and professionally and I’m starting to question the environment I’m in.
Feeling stuck? I wrote about why settling in one place can actually be dangerous for your growth. If you’re curious, check it out here: Why Settling in One Place Can Be Dangerous for Your Growth.
But, let’s get to the real reason I’m writing this post: Lisbon.
I recently visited Lisbon for the first time, and let me tell you, I was shocked in the best way possible, I was still taken aback by how much I loved it.
The streets were clean, the infrastructure was solid, and public transportation actually worked well enough to make getting around a breeze. But what really stood out to me was the overall vibe of the city. It just felt… ordered.
There was this balance of modernity and tradition, Lisbon had this richness that Berlin doesn’t always capture, at least not in the same way. It’s not just in the food and the gorgeous architecture, but in the way the city feels. The people were welcoming, the atmosphere felt peaceful and grounded — everything just felt a little… livable.
The streets didn’t feel unsafe or disorderly, and I didn’t have to dodge random bottles or step over anything unpleasant. It felt clean — and not just physically, but in terms of its overall atmosphere. Lisbon felt way more laid-back and balanced — a place where I could actually imagine calling home.
On my way back to Berlin I find myself wondering… could Lisbon be the place for me? Maybe it’s time to seriously think about it. But … As much as I’ve dreamt about moving to Lisbon, my hopes have taken a bit of a hit.
Lisbon used to have a reputation for being more affordable than other European capitals, but the reality is, rent prices have been climbing steadily — especially in the trendy neighborhoods — bringing them in line with cities like Berlin!
On top of that, salaries in Lisbon are still pretty low compared to other European cities, so the cost of living isn’t as balanced as I once thought. It’s a bummer, but looks like my dream of settling in Lisbon it didn’t last too long!
So here I am again, chasing the original plan moving to Munich. Although is one of the most expensive places to live in Germany, at least the salaries are around 30% higher than what I’ve been offered in Berlin!
But even with the potential for a bigger paycheck, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just stuck in this loop of chasing after cities that are becoming increasingly expensive while the job market still feels a bit of a mirage!
The whole “Germany has tons of job opportunities” narrative is, well, not exactly the truth. Anyone who’s actually lives here knows how tough it can be to land a job, even if you speak German at a C2 level. The competition is fierce, and sometimes it feels like it doesn’t matter how qualified you are.
Sure, the western and the southern part of Germany is still financially doing well, but if the job hunt keeps feeling this grim, it might just be time to explore other options. It’s a tough decision, but I’m honestly getting a little tired of hitting dead ends. I’m even starting to entertain the idea of leaving the country altogether.
Sadly, Lisbon will remain in my heart as a city that surprised me and gave me some amazing daydreams of a life where I could see smiles around and feel a sense of calm in the everyday. It’s the kind of place that makes you think, “This could be home,” but sometimes, reality just doesn’t align with those dreams.
I’m thinking about where to go next. I’ve got some exciting options on my mind, if you’re curious, check it out here: I’m Leaving Berlin. Let me know your thoughts!

Shannon is behind one of Lisbon’s coolest coding school: Le Wagon. We met at Beta-i and got curious to know more about her story and how you start such a project from scratch without being from the city yourself. Time for some questions!
I moved here four years ago to be with my boyfriend who is from Lisbon. I never imagined at that time that I would still be here four years on, but the city has been changing (for the good) at such an alarming rate in the last few years that I feel like I moved somewhere new.
Rather than why I came to live here, the better question is why I stayed. And to answer that, you can read a blog post I published a few weeks ago on Le Wagon — Why would you relocate to Lisbon?
www.lewagon.com
Le Wagon is a code school for non-technical entrepreneurs and creatives. We give people the programming and product development mindset through teaching ruby on rails web development.
My motivation to launch Le Wagon started two years ago while I was working in a local accelerator/ incubator here in Lisbon. I saw a lack of technical talent amongst the founders and also felt that I could benefit myself from understanding on a basic level what is going on behind the scenes of software.
Now, after having gone through the program myself and already running three 9 week batches in Lisbon, I can say I know that and a whole lot more, plus have 60+ Lisbon alumni as a support when it comes to launching my own products and finding cool jobs in the tech market.
Growing very quickly with a very diverse mix of internationals and locals.
We really wanted to be immersed in Lisbon’s startup ecosystem and Beta-i was a great way to access this community.
We could do a better job of this to be honest. At the moment, we are cross promoting events and of course enjoying some impromptu beers on the roof :)
Learning how to learn (again) — their EGOS! As humans, we are conditioned to shy away from challenge. We want all the glory with all the ease. We tend to work in areas and take on tasks that make us feel good. The first three weeks of Le Wagon are an ice cold shower for those that are not accustomed to just not getting something in the beginning. You really have to have faith in yourself and our curriculum when you start the program. The concepts are abstract for most people and they need to time sink in. Le Wagon is like learning to ride a bike. You have to be willing to keep getting on the bike and falling off and trust that eventually if you do that enough times, it will click and you’ll start riding.
To keep the students believing in themselves and their ability. To keep “falling off the bike”.
In our first batch, we had a student that really struggled. And when I say struggled, there were days he didn’t finish a challenge. But the guy had a great attitude. He didn’t give up. He didn’t compare himself to his classmates. He just kept going. After the bootcamp, he was one of the first to get a job and not even in ruby — in Javascript on the backend! He is our mascot here in Lisbon on what it means to give it your all.
Our community is growing locally. We expect in the next year to have our own space with our own cowering for our alumni and ruby on rails developers.
Thanks Shannon for your time and insights!

Here at Salsify, we can’t stop talking about our brand spankin’ new office and team in Lisbon, Portugal! We do love Boston, but nothing can top the beautiful sunny weather and gorgeous beaches of Lisbon. I recently got the chance to sit down with our People Operations Specialist in Portugal, Marta Carvalho, to get her take on Lisbon, Boston, and all things Salsify!
Q: So, what exactly does a People Operations Specialist do?
A: As a part of the People Ops team, it’s my responsibility to promote employee engagement and brand awareness, onboard new hires, support HR processes, team building, and a lot of other fun stuff! Since we are just getting started in Lisbon, my current work is very focused on building and growing the Lisbon team, and ramping up the Salsify employment brand in Lisbon.
Q: How long have you been working for Salsify?
A: A little over one month.
Q: How did you find out about Salsify?
A: I heard about Salsify coming to Lisbon through networking in the Lisbon tech community.
Q: What made you want to work for Salsify?
A: The opportunity to do what I really love in a company with great culture and values. It’s great to be part of this project since the beginning. Plus, I have the opportunity to be a pioneering person in HR and to think, implement, and see through the best policies and procedures!
Q: What is it like working for Salsify versus working for a Portuguese company?
A: For me, the possibility of traveling and working in collaboration with Boston colleagues on a daily basis is something that I really love. Plus, Portuguese companies tend to have long and inconclusive personal meetings! I’ve been struggling a lot with this in my last years :) I’m delighted that things at Salsify are done promptly, on time, and focus on specific goals. I feel that people here are very productive and efficient.
Q: What is the biggest cultural difference that you’ve encountered between Portugal and the United States?
A: Well . . . you all seem to have lunch and dinner pretty early :) I’m used to having dinner by 9 pm for instance while in Boston, it was super common to have dinner by 6 pm. It feels like days and nights in Portugal take longer.
Q: What has been your favorite and least favorite thing about working for Salsify so far?
A: Favorite thing is probably the possibility to work with such a great and friendly team. Least favorite thing is the current temporary office, which is about to change when we move to a new office full of windows and sunshine!
(We actually just moved to our new office! Check it out here.)
Q: Are you someone who can listen to music while you work?
A: Only during some tasks. If I’m doing some sourcing or replying to some emails, then yes. If I need to think about something more strategic or write down policies and procedures, I can’t.
Q: Where in the world would you most like to travel?
A: There are so many places I would like to go that it’s hard to pick out only one. I love sun and beaches, so anything that seems like a paradise are good destinations (Hawaii, Bahamas, Bali…).
Q: Do you have a hidden talent/fact that most people don’t know about you?
A: Well, I dance a lot of Salsa and Bachata. I’m not sure if it is a talent, but it’s something I love to do and I know how to do it.
Q: Tea or coffee?
A: Coffee for sure. Not a fan of tea, only drink it when I’m sick. Tea does not bring me good memories :)
Q: Reading or watching TV?
A: Both. Love to see a good movie or also to do some binge watching on Netflix. However, also love to take a book to Starbucks (yes, Starbucks is very appreciated in Lisbon!) or a nice coffee shop and read it on a rainy day.
Q: What is your favorite thing about Lisbon?
A: What keeps me in Lisbon is definitely being close to my family. Also, our sunny days, good food, and great sights to see make me love Lisbon. What I like the most is the possibility to go to the beach in fifteen minutes from my home! Even in winter, the sun stills shines here and you can have a good time on a nice terrace on the beach.
Q: Best lunch spot in Lisbon?
A: There are so many. Food in Lisbon is the best. I like to go to Portugalia, in Belem (but more because of the space rather than the food).Q: You recently visited the Boston office! Was this your first time in Boston? How did you like it?
A: Just loved it! It was my first time in the US and I was delighted. The first few days were pretty tough. Never felt so much cold in my entire life! But I loved to see the city with and without the snow. You have a beautiful city and compared to Lisbon, everything is so big. I felt very welcome by the whole team and got really impressed about how big we are in Boston. Looking forward to create something similar in Lisbon.
Q: What are you most excited about moving forward?
A: I love the creation processes of everything. So, very excited about creating the Lisbon Team and to set all things for the creation of our offices as well.
Obrigado, Marta, for letting us get to know you and Portugal a bit better! Check out our careers page for more info about all of our amazing job openings, and be sure to follow us on Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter for all the Salsify updates you could ever want.

Haven’t joined Medium yet but still want to read my story? Fine. Click Here
This was a museum that caught my eye when we did our ‘buzz through’ visit to Lisbon in February. Portugal has a centuries long maritime tradition for exploration, military and commercial enterprise and since world history is a subject I’m a little interested in, I put it on the list.
We came back to Lisbon near the end of March and after quite a little bit of ‘what do we want to see?’ conversation, we purchased the 72 hour Lisboa Pass which offers free or discounted admission to dozens of attractions.
Located in the Belém district, home to an amazing number of interesting attractions, Museu de Marinha, also known as the Maritime Museum or the Navy museum, is on the list with a 20% discount. So, instead of 7€ (US$7.65 at the time) we were admitted for only US$6.13 each.
The museum is located in one end of the Jerónimos Monastery building, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which is an attraction on its own. One we didn’t visit, BTW.

Let me tell you a story. This one takes us to Lisbon, Portugal, where I went to visit someone who has been my fairy godmother and her amazing husband. To protect her privacy, let’s call her “Ballerina.”
Now, Lisbon was everything you’d imagine, great people, great food, and endless opportunities to learn. Between physics, entropy, mountains, ballet, and Portuguese culture, my mind was buzzing. But, as always, the universe had a peculiar surprise in store for me. You see, Ballerina has this friend, Karma, who happens to be a Tibetan Buddhist Kempo monk. Yes, his name is as amazing as his wisdom. One day, we decided to head to the beach for some sun and sea after I met with folks from the World Bank to brainstorm ways to tackle water scarcity. Pretty typical day, right?
Well, here’s the twist: monks don’t usually carry swim trunks. So, what do you do when your monk friend wants to dip his toes in the ocean? You go and buy him a pink swimsuit, of course. Armed with this purchase, we made our way to the water, chatting about life, music, and whatever else crossed our minds. Turns out, Karma had spent some time in Mexico and spoke Spanish. This led us down a hilarious rabbit hole of Latin music, culminating in a spontaneous rendition of *Despacito*. There we were, a cosmologist, a Buddhist monk, and a theoretical physics PhD student, on a Portuguese beach, singing and dancing to a reggaeton hit. Life’s surreal moments, I tell you.
But wait, there’s more. I’m not exactly an ocean person. I grew up in the Andes, far from any sea, and I didn’t realize how quickly the water could chill me. As the sun set, my body temperature dropped fast, too fast. Ballerina, who, by the way, is not just an award-winning cosmologist and a ballerina but also a seasoned mountaineer, immediately noticed something was off. Her mountaineering instincts kicked in, and she got me out of the water before I turned into a human popsicle. After almost giving her a heart attack with my near-hypothermic state, we bundled me up and made it back home safe.
That trip wasn’t just about beaches, physics, or even *Despacito*. It was about being in the company of some of the most brilliant and fascinating minds I’ve ever met. Karma, in particular, taught me so much about the art of controlling the mind, meditating, and navigating emotions with clarity. It was like a crash course in mastering the internal chaos we all carry.
But more than anything, this trip reminded me of the simple joy in life’s beautiful chaos. The cliff, the mountains, the black cat, the dreams, the tree, the hedgehogs, the sunset, each a little piece of the puzzle. Between deep conversations, fresh ideas, and hours spent playing with their incredible kids, I felt myself rediscovering the wild, curious, and playful side of me. It’s the part that often gets buried under all the equations and theories, but it’s always there, waiting to come alive again.
Life’s better when it surprises you, isn’t it?

It was a nightmare to leave the “Estação Oriente” in Lisbon.
After spending a delightful few days in Porto, I boarded the AP train, eager to return to Lisbon.
The trip took me 3 good hours that I spent writing and communicating with my laptop. The train wifi was working properly.
However, as I arrived at the Lisbon train station (Aug 5), I found myself in an unexpected predicament.
The bustling station was packed with an ocean of people from all corners of the globe, and a wave of claustrophobia washed over me.
I felt in some ways lost and unsure of how to reach my hotel via the subway train.
Navigating through the sea of travelers proved to be a daunting task.
Each person seemed to be in a hurry, and it felt like the entire world had gathered in Lisbon to witness a momentous event — the Pope.
Feeling overwhelmed, I took a moment to compose myself and tried to spot any sign or direction for the subway.
However, it was not easy amidst the crowd. And every escalator was not working.

Two black socks hang from plastic clips above the Travessa da Cruz do Torel, an alleyway in Lisbon. I cut through the Jardim do Torel on the way to my favorite park. Yet I’ve never been this way, turning right instead of left when exiting the garden.
I lean upon the golden wall, taking in the details of the surroundings. Slanting shadows carry shade and slice the buildings into softer, darker tones.
High above the buildings, above the wire and the socks, sits the pale, subdued moon. I can’t fathom what it is — what it physically is — dust, rock, an assortment of matter. What I see, perhaps, isn’t dust drifting into darkness; I see something like a stone, patiently waiting to shine.
I can conceptualize a stone. When I look into the sky, it’s like a rock beneath a moving river; is that not what it is?
Later it’ll change, morph into a sphere of light, glistening from afar.
Its emergence means that night is falling, and that feels good. I feel the change of weather, the chilling of the breeze.

Three days in June
I went straight toward the Tagus River walking across the shopping. This is the ""Parque das Nações"", Lisbon.
Recently I made a trip by train from Porto to Lisbon.
The Alfa pendular comfort 1st class is easy and tranquil.
It takes almost 3 horas from Campanhã station in Porto to Oriente station in Lisbon.
The train has wifi you can work during the trip. I felt a little dizzy and had to stop my work.
When arriving in the city… the Orient station is connected to the Vasco da Gama shopping mall and the metro station.
If you take the subway the first thing anyone will notice is the art poetry and murals of the metro stations. They inspire people all day long.
On the wall written in Portuguese on blue azulejos (tile art)…

Nestled along the banks of the Tagus River in Lisbon’s vibrant Parque das Nações district is the Vasco da Gama Tower, an architectural gem that marries Portugal’s rich maritime heritage with contemporary design.
Rising to 145 meters (476 feet), it is the tallest structure in Portugal and a symbol of the city’s forward-looking spirit.
Named after the famed Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the first European to reach India by sea, the tower embodies the adventurous spirit that propelled Portugal to the forefront of the Age of Discoveries.
Its design is inspired by the billowing sails of a caravel, the iconic ship that carried explorers like da Gama to uncharted territories. This homage is not just in name but in the tower's silhouette against Lisbon’s skyline.
Designed by architects Leonor Janeiro and Nick Jacobs in collaboration with the engineering firm SOM (Skidmore, Owings & Merrill), the Vasco da Gama Tower was originally constructed for Expo ’98, the World’s Fair hosted by Lisbon in 1998.
The event commemorated the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama’s voyage to India and spurred significant urban development…

A new chapter. A new adventure.
Lisbon has slowly but surely won me over. It’s a city where I’ve decided to pause and settle for a while, despite the numerous considerations that influenced this decision. Now, I’m excited to share my journey in Lisbon, including my discoveries of its food, cafes, and various other delights.
This isn’t my first experience living abroad. Before Lisbon, I spent six years in Izmir, Türkiye, which was no small stint, especially since I moved there when I was just 18. Now, I’ve chosen to continue my journey in Lisbon, though the future might see me moving elsewhere or perhaps returning to my home country, Indonesia. For now, Lisbon is my home, and I can’t wait to explore and share its wonders.
Visiting Lisbon as a tourist, I found the city to be incredibly charming and lovely. However, by moving here made me realise how hill-y this city is! I arrived in September, at that time it was still pretty warm — maybe around 30+C, I was sweating all the time!
Surprisingly, I’ve adapted! I’ve learned to control my breathing, maintain a steady walking pace, and navigate the public transportation system, which has helped me avoid excessive walking and sweating — obviously 🤣. Now, I can truly appreciate all that Lisbon has to offer, both its beauty and its challenges.
Coming to Lisbon without knowing Portuguese has been surprisingly manageable, as most people here speak English. However, this convenience has made me a bit “lazy” about learning the language — I think I took it for granted somehow. Despite this, I’m starting to learn Portuguese, albeit slowly, and I’m doing my best to speak it as much as possible. Even though people in restaurants, cafes, and other places often ask me to speak in English instead, I appreciate their understanding of my struggle to even form a single sentence 🥹
Like many European countries, I don’t have particularly problems on finding Asian foods in Lisbon. There are some restaurants which are pretty good, however I am still in the mission finding the best ones here. Beside Asian cuisines, there are other lots of foods choices. I have my favourite bagel place, coffee (even the overpriced one 🤣☕️), and local food like Francesinha (I like this a lot!). I will make different writings about it — Lisbon food review!
Surprisingly, there is a big Asian supermarket here, quite close with the airport and decent pricing. Mostly products from China, but they have quite variable options from Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese. As I am Asian myself, having this HUGE supermarket is a blessing! 😇
There are foods that I am quite familiar here in Portugal which is pretty similar like in Indonesia, they have different fillings — like Risoles, Croquete, and some biscuits (like cat-tongue, etc).
So, food culture in Portugal is quite rich. I don’t think I ever have food shock here in extreme ways! Don’t worry if want to move or live here, your stomach will be fine and full too 🍽️
Diversity is a thing here in Lisbon, I think it is nice to have such a diverse community. People are surprisingly warm and friendly tho. According to the European Commission’s survey about Quality of life in European cities in 2023, 94% population agreed that the city is a good place to live in general. For me in general, Lisbon is a safe city. Obviously like another cities in the world, there are sketchy neighbourhoods and crimes, but I found in general is pretty safe. So far, I don’t have negative experiences here.
I think I’ve written quite a bit here, so I’ll wrap it up for now. There’s much more to share about Lisbon, so stay in touch! More stories to come. See you soon!

In February of 2016, I started a new experience in my life. I was cast as the leader of a team (a team of two, at the time, including myself, though having grown a lot more since then…) that would work with a US company.
Almost two years have passed since and now it’s time for a new challenge. It’s also time to reevaluate the time and experiences taken from it.
First things first. For the first few months, I will try to minimize any disruption as best as I can. In the beginning, I’m all about understanding everything that’s in and around the company. How they work, who the people are, and how they get along together. Understanding how they think helps me to adjust my discourse to something that would be more familiar to them, more inline with what they’ve come to expect so far.
I’m always careful with my first interactions. I have seen many times in my life people coming along and, in attempting to be helpful, start right away trying to fix any issues that may come their way. In my view, this approach, while sometimes needed, is rarely successful. People will usually see it as a source of disruption. You won’t have a full understanding of the problems or how they came about, and how they have tried to solve them in the past.
So I start by listening. I listen to interactions, I try to understand inside jokes, understand what worries they might have ( big or small ) on a personal and professional level. I usually try to avoid making any major decisions without understand all of the problematic.
Before this, I only had the experience of working with people that mostly were beside me or at least within the same city. When presented with this challenge I immediately identified two important issues — Not sharing the same space and different timezones. I started to read a lot about remote working, and even though most of it referred to individuals rather than a team setting, the underlying principles still apply, so I could already see some issues that we were bound to face.
So how do you connect and work with people taking into account these possible issues? You communicate! You over communicate! You spend a lot of time talking to be on the same page.
Communication will also help when different cultures are in play. I spend some time understanding not only how they are as individuals, but also the cultural traces in their personalities. And whatever I didn’t understand I would ask. An expression, a feeling, some sarcastic remark, or jokes that I didn’t get… I much prefer to ask than sit there guessing.
I found a great team with awesome individuals on the client side. When we came onboard, with us being an offshore team, it is easy to start setting up a divide between people. Us and them. Them and us. Fortunately, the client is amazing and they had the same way of thinking as I did!
They gave us company emails. We had access to the same communications channels as them. We got access to staging and production servers. We got t-shirts! They treated us, and expected from us, the same as any person in their company.
No one gains from one side being treated differently. For me, the only way for this to work as best as possible is through letting the offshore team be completely integrated with the process/spirit of the client. Of course, there’s a large component of trust involved, but with this kind of attitude, they’ll gain people eager to help since they share the client goals and view them as their own.
It is important to note that this is something that needs to be addressed on both sides and is a never ending story, a continuous and ongoing effort. It can happen naturally, but you also have to create and nurture an environment where people can continue to grow and feel valued.
Sometimes you will make mistakes… I believe it’s not a matter of if but when. You will have an unexpected behaviour, or you will introduce a bug in the system. At some point in time, you will do something that’s not in the greater plan of things.
What are the next steps? Tell the truth! Admit your mistake.
Maybe they will understand, maybe they won’t. One thing is for sure though, you will grow and strengthen the bonds that everyone shares. I see no harm in making mistakes, the problem is when people don’t admit to them.
From the first day, I try to remove any dependency on us that the client might have. If I see something that might create a dependency I try to plan how to remove it. Are we the only ones with knowledge on some part of the platform? Let’s pass that knowledge on to someone on the client’s side. For some clients we’re the only source of technology on their team. When that happens we have to be extra careful and try to complement that with a better knowledge base on the tech side of things.
I do the same on a team level ( I’ve written about that subject in a different blog post ), so I apply the same principle. “Isn’t it great for business if I create dependency?” — I hear you ask. Of course it is, but that isn’t the way we work. We want people to work with us because we are great at what we do; not because they are shackled to us due to an over-reliance on what we know.
This was a great experience! The things I’ve learned from working with a different country and timezone; for a different culture, with different views, is something that has helped me to grow immensely! Sharing knowledge and views and understanding the culture was an awesome experience.
If you have any comments or feedback on this subject, I’d love to hear from you!

By sheer luck, we arrived in Lisbon during Festa de Santiago Antonio (The Feast of Saint Anthony). This month-long celebration of Anthony of Padua (who is actually not the patron saint of Lisbon but is preferred by the locals) sees the city transform into a spectacular carnival. The streets are decorated with colorful ribbons, street food stalls are packed into every open corner, cold beer flows from the taps, and the air smells of grilled anchovies.
Saint Anthony is also referred to as the holy matchmaker. During each festival, 16 lucky couples get to wed in a lavish ceremony!
We spent most of our days in Lisbon walking and eating, eating and walking. Since Lisbon is known as “the city of seven hills,” it was easy to work up an appetite. Even coming from San Francisco (which is quite hilly) we were impressed by the steepness of several streets. To address the challenges of getting from point A to B in the city, many of the steeper streets have funicular trains ready to ferry people up and down the hills.
We treated ourselves to the street food stalls on many many occasions…
Our host also shared his cooking with us!
On our third day, we took the ferry across Tagus Bay to the city of Cacilhas and followed an abandoned road along the water. This road eventually led to a statue of Christ the Redeemer, a monument inspired by the one in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. This statue (inaugurated in 1959) was created to express gratitude that the Portuguese were spared the worst effects of World War II. It also looks over the April 25 bridge…which looks awfully familiar to the one we just left behind.
In 1775, one of Europe’s most powerful earthquakes hit Lisbon (estimated to be between 8.0 and 9.0). The earthquake struck during a holiday morning and did catastrophic damage, killing an estimated 60,000 people and destroying 85% of the city. Subsequent fires then burned in Lisbon for over 6 days and a tsunami with waves over 20 feet hit the shore.
The pic below is from the Alfama neighborhood. This neighborhood is one of the oldest in the city having been spared the worst of the earthquake damage.
Sadly, 5 days weren’t near enough for Lisbon (or Portugal obviously)! Hoping we will return!
Olá- hello
Obrigad(a/o) — thanks (the o or a depends on the gender of the SPEAKER… confusing for my Spanish-oriented brain)
Saúde-cheers!

Kristina, I am glad to meet you and am simply enchanted by your artworks — I cannot find a better name to describe what you do. Let’s start from the very beginning. Your passion for photography and your first creative steps took place… Where and when?
I was born and raised in the southern part of Ukraine. Since I was a very artistic child, my parents used the opportunity — they introduced me to all kinds of creative expression: painting, music, dancing. I was fond of seeing the beauty of the moment and at some point, — around age 7–8 years old — when my grandparents bought one of those first digital cameras, I started taking photos. Just shooting everything I saw around — mostly nature. Of course, not all of the shots, but some, made my grandpa admit “Oh, she’s a good eye!”.It was the very beginning of my photography path. Hence, shooting nature still attracts me — it is a way of meditation and a source of inspiration for me.Another way of expressing my mood and showcasing creativity was artistic shooting with a good friend from my school. We used to dress up and invent themed photoshoots, crafting all the details from scratch with our own hands — they were important — and incorporating a touch of aesthetics to each picture.Finally, I kept forgetting and belittling one important point — my photos were displayed in a town hall exhibition in my hometown. It was literally the whole exhibition of my photographs. Talking about it now, I feel goosebumps.
So nature was your primary shooting experience. What about developing your eye and style? What kind of photography mostly attracts you now? What would you call your favorite style and does it allow experimenting?
Since humans are a part of nature, I love shooting portraits and body portraits. Now I will explain myself better. When I take a photo, I try to capture the expression so that the dialogue between the person and their sensations is seen in the picture. There is much more than face and body when it comes to seeing body language. I find gestures, movement, shapes, and sights even more important than the primary image, clothing sets, and surroundings. I like minimalistic photos, which speak to people’s hearts more than to their brains and eyes. However, aesthetics are very important to me — I always see it in details and (people say) am good at showcasing it.
Is there anything really special for you during the photoshoot? Something you can never omit.
My point is using the photoshoot as a therapy. It is an intimate process which I can really compare to a confession. The camera sees a lot. However, I have 3 main rules for any shooting to take place smoothly. Before we shoot , we need to meet and have a talk over a coffee or tea, or whatever. It helps the person to open up and feel more comfortable.And the second thing is that the person should understand what they feel like during the process. It is essential, as the sensations and feelings cannot be hidden once snapped with a camera. That’s why I need the first step of meeting before the shoot — so there is no intimidation, but freedom and comfort.Rule number 3 is putting myself into the model’s shoes from time to time — it makes me understand how a person in front of the camera feels in different situations. In case I realize there are some points making me uncomfortable as a model, I avoid them in my own shoots.
Are there any taboos for you? What would you never shoot?
My principle goes far beyond any taboos — I try everything at least once. Otherwise, how would I know if there is something I like or I don’t like? Every kind of art is unique and it might make you come up with some deep ideas — it will make you broaden your skills or knowledge.I am pretty much philosophical in this aspect. Everything can take place, unless it is your own experience telling you that you don’t like it.
An idea as your motto during your lifetime? Or a couple of them…
In my opinion , there is always something going on in life which can change our perception, our opinion , and our principles. So there is no constant definition of what guides me in life other than changes. I guess there is a saying that the only permanent thing in life is change. And this is what I totally agree with. The strategy can change according to your goals, your values , and your sensations — and it would be a very poor decision to follow only one rule for the whole of your life.

In Lisbon’s Mouraria, the birthplace of a legend.
Fado (“Fate”) is Portuguese “Blues” music born in the slums of Lisbon in the 1820s…Well, that’s the kind of intro you might expect to read in an article about Fado. To our surprise, flaneuring through the winding streets of the Mouraria in the oldest part of Lisbon, Teresa and I discovered the actual birthplace of the woman whose music marked the emergence of Fado from the shadows into the light.
The plan for the day, in as much as there was one, was to start at the Chapel of Our Lady of Health, at the bottom of the Mouraria, wander through the backways until we got hungry, and then find our way to Zé da Mourari, a traditional Portuguese restaurant that Teresa particularly wanted to try.
The chapel was built as an appeal to the Virgin Mary for her to intercede with God and save the city from the plague, which ravaged Lisbon during the 16th Century. The crowned statue of Mary at the front of the chapel is still paraded around the neighborhood once each year in thanks for her deliverance.
Just behind the church, the roads zigzag up and along the hillside towards Sao Jorge Castle, through the Mouraria, one of the few parts of the city that survived the earthquake of 1755. The name means “Moor-area.” It’s the old quarter of the city where the muslims were confined after the Christian reconquest of Lisbon in 1147. Because of its narrow winding alleyways and crooked streets, The Mouraria remained a magnet for outcasts. It attracted a rougher crowd of immigrants, sailors and sex-workers. Now it’s just starting to emerge as a rather hip part of Lisbon, while still keeping its authentic character.
Strangely enough, as we soon discovered, many of the immigrant in this neighborhood today are from Bangladesh — the new muslims who are welcomed to Portugal. It’s obvious not only from the restaurants and stores with Bengali signs, but also from the colorful men’s sarongs hanging out the windows to dry with the laundry. Even the graffiti and street art has a Bengali flair.
We wandered around until our feet got sore, then headed in the general direction of the restaurant. The road narrowed, then widened into a tiny square with two trees loaded with oranges in the center. The houses here were old, not more than two stories, with some of the doors laughably tiny. The artwork on the walls was playful yet beautifully done. We were captivated.
The walls contained some clever visual jokes, like this woman blowing miniature ballerinas towards a cat…
And this door with a poem scrawled next to it that reads: “I want my love/There is no other/I want my love/There goes another!”
We noticed at the far end of the little square a gleaming white building that seemed almost out of place in the scruffy but well-decorated little square. A sign on the building explained that this square was named in honor of Fado legend Maria Severa, who was born in this house in 1820 and lived in this neighborhood.
Her father was a gypsy, her mother owned a tavern and was a sex-worker known as “ Barbuda” — the bearded one. Maria, however, was great beauty by all accounts, and perhaps unavoidably fell into her mother’s profession. She sang early Fado songs in the taverns and brothels of the Mouraria. According to one source (Lisboa, a Love Affair), she was the first person to sing fados in the street, accompanying herself on guitar and composing her own lyrics. She sang about her life and her problems: love and heartbreak, betrayal, jealousy, revenge, tragedy; the same problems as the people she lived among. Her style of Fado became wildly popular. Indeed, one has to wonder if strands of this acceptance of hardship that will break the soul might have gone all the way back to the moors left to fend for themselves on this hill.
There are no portraits of Maria, but here are some descriptions written by various writers who met her: (with thanks to my source Atlas Lisboa):
Writer Luis Augusto Palmeirim: When I entered Severa’s house, a modest dwelling of the vulgar type her unlucky peers inhabit, there she was, smoking, leaning back on a straw couch, wearing polishing slippers dotted with red twine, a silk flowery kerchief on her head and the sleeves of her dress rolled up to the elbows. She was a rather swarthy, thin, nervous woman, remarkable for her magnificent peninsular eyes. On the gaming table laid a guitar, the inseparable companion to her triumphs.
Poet Bulhão Pato: It will be difficult for another Severa to appear, haughty and impetuous, so generous as ready to punch the face of whoever would act rogue on her! Brave, full of affection for the ones she cared for, as well as rough to her enemies, She was no ordinary woman, you can be sure of that.
One of her lovers was the Count of Vimioso, a “bohemian” aristocrat who used to take Maria out to bullfights. This gave her exposure beyond the Mouraria. She was hired to sing at parties in high society, and her reputation grew. Tragically, Maria died of tubuculosis at the age of twenty six. However according to Lisboa, a Love Affair, what she really died of was a broken heart, because the social difference between her and the count was never going to allow a marriage between them: “She actually died poor and abandoned, of tuberculosis, in a miserable brothel on Rua do Capelão, on November 30, 1846…Her last words are said to have been: ‘I die without ever having lived’ — She was 26 years old.”
Something in her music had quickened the heart of Lisbon. Fado had changed because of her; it became this powerful expression of desire crushed by fate. Because of Maria, Fado moved from the shadows into popular culture. Her life became a legend, then the subject of a novel, then a play, which in 1933 was turned into the first Portugese movie ever made with sound.
As Teresa and I strolled from the little square that bore the legend’s name, I thought about the shrines to these two Marias, just a few short blocks from one another. The people of Lisbon loved the Virgin Mary because she saved them from their fate. They loved Maria Severa because she sang about their fate. She transformed their sorrow into more than simply suffering. She made it into something beautiful and holy.

TLDR there were some interesting talks at remote Web Summit this year, but the real value of Web Summit is the ad-hoc meeting and chatting with people, seeing what startups from across the world are working on, and seeing just in general what the tech world is up to. All of which is much more difficult remotely.
Last week I attended the Web Summit tech conference for what I think was the 6th time. I went two or maybe three times in Dublin (I must be getting old if I can’t remember my conference visits!), twice in Lisbon, and now once from the comfort of my MacBook in Kildare.
You can read previous reviews of my colleagues and I’s trips — 2017 here and 2018 here, and they’re obviously quite different from the experience this year. Going to Lisbon was of course part of the fun, but even when it was in Dublin and I just had to walk across the road from my office in Ballsbridge to the RDS, being there in person was infinitely better.
Most talks at tech conferences are interesting at best, boring at worst, but rarely have anything revelatory; for the most part you are unlikely to hear anything you didn’t know already. AWS re:Invent being the obvious exception, where they launch new services at the event — but even with these you can always watch the repeats online afterwards.
One advantage of Web Summit however is the sheer scale — it is huge, with more talks running in parallel for several days than you’d ever get to see — so when it was held in person there are always diamonds among the rough, and if a talk isn’t that good you just stroll over to another one. Remotely however it was difficult to stay focused on the talks, and trying to find the good ones, when work and real life were also competing.
Throughout the three days, even though I’d kept meetings to a minimum, I found myself working on my current project and sending emails more than I spent “at” the conference. It was hard to justify to myself postponing working on an important new feature for watching something online; I always feel pressure to deliver in work, and when I wasn’t actually in a different country at an event, it felt slightly wrong to be sitting there watching talks when I could be building.
There were some exceptions — I saw a great talk by Siemens’ Carolina Alves & Francisco Freitas on using machine learning to recognise dangerous driving in traffic. Their talk was a detailed and honest account of their work, how they gathered and labeled data (a hackathon!) and more. AI and ML is already becoming so important to business, and I love seeing real-world examples like this of putting it into practice.
I saw another refreshingly honest talk, again also by Siemens (Aymeric Sarrazin and CTO Peter Keorte), about IoT, where even though the title was “How IoT will change the world”, they discussed how there is still a lot of work to be done before happens and that IoT is an enabler of change, as oppose to the change in itself.
I attended others which were good also, and I had a lot marked down in my schedule, but I found myself missing a lot of them as I got distracted by my “real” work.
Most of my time at the physical Web Summits was spent just wandering around the huge halls, browsing the startup stands and chatting with people if something looked interesting. Most of the big outfits also had stands, usually with an interesting piece of tech to try out — like in 2017 when I got to try out a quick development tutorial on the HoloLens:
This year there was none of that, at least for me anyway. I was contacted by a fair few people looking to have a “virtual coffee”, and it’s always good to meet people, but these were mostly sales pitches. I missed the casual conversations, seeing companies and projects that I wasn’t expecting to see, and the learning which comes from being immersed for a few days in all things tech.
Web Summit used to have organised pub crawls aswell, which as well as great for seeing more of beautiful Lisbon, was another fun way to meet and network with people from across the world. The most networking I got done this week was with a 2 year old who loves trying to mash my keyboard as I’m working.
I’m hoping the world can return to some level of normal next year and the Web Summit and other conferences can return to what they were, but this year’s won’t be making the top 5. Or is that 6?
I have to mention that I’m fully aware that being stuck at home and not enjoying a few days in Lisbon is not in any way hardship; I’m safe at home, with a great job that allows me to attend events like this, remote or otherwise.
I’ve friends in healthcare who risk their lives every day for the rest of us, so any complaints here are not real complaints, I know how privileged I am to blogging about tech conferences!
Any thoughts or comments, let me know below, or feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or Twitter. You can learn more about my company, Liberty IT here and yes, we’re hiring!

Lisbon is a must visit while traveling to Europe. It is a very affordable city compared to most in Western Europe, but doesn’t skip out on great food, excellent site seeing, and amazing shopping.
My Experience
After graduating college in the Spring of 2022, my girlfriend and I took a month long trip to Europe. Our final destination was Lisbon before flying back to Miami. Let me just say, it was a great way to end our trip on a high note.
Food
Lisbon had some great eats everywhere we went. I would say a big highlight was TimeOut Market. This was a huge food market in which you had the option of any kind of food you are in the mood for. Everything we tried here was delicious. We also made sure to try Portugal’s famous pastry, Pastel de Nada, at multiple locations. This sweet treat with some espresso was always an amazing way to start off the day.
The biggest food standout of Lisbon was a slice of chocolate cake, see below. This is easily the best cake I have ever eaten in my life. I would travel back to Lisbon just to have another slice. If you ever visit Lisbon, eating this cake should be the number 1 thing to do on your list.

There is something perplexing about attempting to express oneself in any language. This issue becomes more salient when what we are trying to articulate is an experience rife with a mosaic of sentiments too complex to comprehend outright, let alone to transform into words. The constant urge to do so, though, does not emerge out of nothing. Our compulsion is primarily driven by an inexplicable urge to dress fuzzy pre-conceptual experiences in words that we understand in order to be able to share them with others. In an attempt to capture fleeting experiences we have, we might try everything at our disposal to grab on to, and subsequently frame, memories that seem to make our lives more colorful, in hopes of chiseling ourselves into becoming interesting individuals not only vis a vis ourselves, but also in the eyes of others.
We encounter such an interesting example in the novel Night Train to Lisbon written by the philosophy professor Peter Bieri under the pseudonym Pascal Mercier. At the very beginning the protagonist of the story (Raimund Gregorius), a teacher of classics at a Gymnasium in the city of Bern, Switzerland, has an encounter which would forever change his life.
On his way to school, Gregorius meets a lady wearing a red coat standing on the Kirchenfeld Bridge, ready to jump and end her life. No sooner than Gregorius realizes this than he rushes to try and stop her — and he does so successfully. She later on accompanies him to school, and along the way he learns that her native language was Portuguese.
As banal and mundane this happenstance might seem, it was sufficient to turn Gregorius’ life upside down in a way he wouldn’t have imagined.
The experience itself might have had nothing to do with the radical decisions he would subsequently make, but it definitely played a rather crucial role in the abrupt shift that would see him embarking on an odyssey of self-discovery and transformation.
Experiences of this calibre tend to instigate us to brusquely but intentionally decide to change the course of our lives as a consequence of an inevitable outburst due to the endless, unconscious, accumulation of selves that one keeps hoarding with the passing of time.
One day we think we’re going to start a new job at our dream company, the other we find ourselves doing something we wouldn’t have imagined doing not in a hundred years time. Change is infinitesimal and can be very difficult to discern. Crossing a certain threshold, we look in the mirror and understand that we cannot recognize ourselves anymore. Where does this dissonance come from though? Why is it too difficult to ‘go with the flow’, to give in to the uncertainties of life, and incorporate change as a core feature of life? These questions present themselves in their blinding clarity when on a day like any other Gregorius is stricken by a sudden realization that he did not know who he was anymore.
In a fate-like circumstance, Gregorius knew that something was different the second he met the lady in red standing on the bridge reading a paper under the rain. Somehow this event made him decide to leave his stuff behind and walk away from school without looking back.
Driven by a curious desire to plunge himself into the unknown, the initial contours of the rebellion against his previous self materialized in the form of breakfast, which he left intact, at a hotel’s restaurant where he had never been before.
After that, he visited a Spanish library that he used to frequent. The concatenation of events led him to stumble upon a book, written in Portuguese, left behind on a table by a customer. The encounter with the lady in red was still haunting him, and it seemed to him that the pieces of the puzzle were coming right into place.
Gregorius knew that the compass of his exciting new endeavor was pointing in the right direction when the first paragraph, which he made the owner of the library read and translate for him, said the following:
“Of thousand experiences we have, we find language for one at most and even this one merely by chance and without the care it deserves. Buried under all the mute experiences are those unseen ones that give our life its form, its color, and its melody. Then, when we turn to these treasures, as archeologists of the soul, we discover how confusing they are. The subject of contemplation refuses to stand still, the words bounce off the experience and in the end, pure contradictions stand on the paper. For a long time, I thought it was a defect, something to be overcome. Today I think it’s different: that recognition of the confusion is the ideal path to understanding these intimate yet enigmatic experiences. That sounds strange, even bizarre, I know. But ever since I have seen the issue in this light, I have the feeling of being really awake and alive for the first time.”
It was a passage that resonated strongly with him, so much so that he decided to jump on a train to Lisbon to track down the writer of the book titled A Goldsmith of Words by Amadeu de Prado. De Prado, as Gregorius would eventually figure out, was a medical doctor who had helped treat one of the central figures of the Salazar regime. Motivated by a sense of guilt at having saved the Butcher of Lisbon’s life, he decided to join the resistance in penitence for his ‘sin’.
In a sense, Gregorius was on a journey of self-discovery that was primarily guided by a curiosity to learn more about the biography of Amadeu de Prado. Perhaps, he thought to himself, he would know more about himself by getting to walk in the shoes of someone else. During the ‘search’, Gregorius had the time to contemplate and reflect upon himself by recalling important episodes of his life when he had to make crucial decisions, and to imagine alternative scenarios in the case that he had chosen differently. Deciphering de Prado’s book, he thought to himself, he would be able to authentically know himself more profoundly.
However, two things scared Gregorius during the quest made more than anything else: 1) falling unconscious because of recurrent episodes of dizziness, which he thought, could cause memory loss, and 2) seeing any doctor whom he didn’t know because fearing that the doctor would make him lose himself.
This latter was a major source of concern right before getting some medicals done following the advice of his Ophthalmologist. “What if they find something bad? Something that would make me lose myself?” Gregorius asked him.
Gregorius’ dealt with his terrible hypochondria-like fear by finding recourse in the static, dead languages of the past, like ancient Greek and Hebrew. However, one of de Prado’s reflections cited below, prompted him to reexamine his views.
“Maybe it’s like this: I’d like to rearrange Portuguese words. The sentences that would emerge from this new order must not be odd or eccentric, not exalted, affected or artificial. They must be archetypal sentences in Portuguese so that you have the feeling that they originated directly and from the transparent, sparkling nature of this language. The words must be as unblemished as polished marble, and they must be pure as the notes in a Back partita, which turn everything that is not themselves into a perfect silence. Sometimes, when I am feeling more tolerant about the linguistic morass, I think, it could be the easy silence of a living room or the relaxed silence between lovers. But when I am totally possessed by rage over the clichéd use of words, then it must be nothing less than the clear, cool silence of outer space, where I make my solitary way as the only person who speaks Portuguese.”
For Gregorius, the passage felt like a call to return to the basics of a language in order to reinvent it in an attempt to capture the concreteness of life experiences. The result, as de Prado suggests, would be an ‘unblemished, laconic text’; a language that, while not completely new, succeeds to express beautifully the essence of inner experiences.
De Prado’s reflection underscores a human necessity to continuously renew oneself like a chrysalis throughout different stages in our lives.
Externally, this idea manifests in the form of excessive consumption. Buying the latest model of any product seems to satisfy a lurking desire to periodically renew and revitalize ourselves.
Internally, it manifests in the form of a constant struggle to articulate the mounting change in our idiosyncrasies which according to de Prado and Gregorius, can be achieved by waxing lyrical in the hopes of capturing our concrete experiences through a genuine discourse rather than by alluding to concepts or languages long dead.
This is echoed by Amadeu de Prado’s reflections where he asserts that expressing oneself anew can be achieved by twisting the language to resuscitate faded concepts in order to make them adapt to our continuously evolving life experiences.
Unfortunately, this struggle never ends because as Nietzsche, who had a fine grasp of this interminable dance, eloquently writes:
“Alas! what are you, my written and my painted thoughts! Not long ago you were young and malicious and full of thorns and secret spices- you made me sneeze and laugh- and now? You have doffed your novelty, and some of you, I fear, are ready to become truths, so immortal do they look, so tediously honest! And was it ever otherwise? What then do we write and paint, we mandarins with Chinese brush? Alas, only that which is about to fade and lose its scent! Alas, only birds exhausted by flight, which let themselves be caught with our hand! We immortalize things exhausted and mellow! And it is only for your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have many colors; but nobody will divine how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved- wicked thoughts!”

Have you ever found yourself running on empty, going through the motions without really feeling connected to what you’re doing?
That’s where I was before this trip. There’s a point when you realize you’re just… tired. Not just physically, but emotionally and creatively. I needed this trip not just to escape but to find myself again.
We live in a world that worships hustle, where productivity is often measured by how much we do, how busy we are, and how little we rest. I’ve always been someone who pushes through, who keeps going even when I know I’m running on nothing but coffee and maybe sugar lol. But as I wandered through the streets of Barcelona, from the towering Sagrada Familia to the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter, I realized something.
These iconic places are filled with life and energy, but instead of feeling energized, I realized I was missing the point. I was so focused on seeing everything and doing everything that I wasn’t truly experiencing any of it. Even on the subway, surrounded by people, I felt disconnected, like I was just going through the motions. It hit me that maybe, just maybe, it was okay to slow down and not do it all.
Rest isn’t just about lying down or sitting still. It’s about giving yourself permission to move at your own pace, to let go of the need to be constantly productive. As I walked through the narrow streets of Alfama, I felt something shift. The colorful buildings, the quiet moments — they invited me to slow down and just be.
Sitting at Castelo de Sao Jorge, looking out over the city, I didn’t feel the usual urge to capture the perfect photo or check off the next item on the list. Instead, I let myself just enjoy the view, the company, the moment. When we wandered into a little perfume store, it wasn’t about buying something; it was about the simple pleasure of experiencing something new, something beautiful, without any pressure. These small moments reminded me that it’s okay to simply exist, to find joy in the present.
Something I hadn’t expected was how much inspiration I would find just by slowing down and paying attention. In the midst of the busy streets, the street art, the intricate tiles, the history embedded in the architecture — even these chairs all over Barcelona — it all started to speak to me in a way I hadn’t felt in a long time.
Everywhere I looked, there was something that sparked my imagination — a piece of street art that made me pause, a beautifully tiled floor that told a story, even the way the buildings stood, each with its own history and character. It reminded me that creativity isn’t always about creating; sometimes, it’s about observing, about letting the world around you fill you with new ideas and perspectives. I realized that inspiration is everywhere if you just take the time to see it.
But beyond the beauty of the cities and the inspiration I found in the streets, what really stayed with me were the moments of connection. Sharing a meal, laughing with friends, those little moments of joy — they’re what made this trip truly meaningful. Like when we finally got our hands on those infamous Pastel da Nata from Pasteis de Belem — AMAZING.
Whether it was enjoying crepes, chatting at the plaza while eating gelato at midnight, or just sitting down for brunch at 4 p.m. because we felt like it — these moments weren’t about doing something impressive. They were about being present with the people I care about, about savoring life in its simplest, most joyful forms. And honestly, that’s where I found the most rest — in those small, meaningful moments that reminded me of what’s really important.
As I walked down the well in Quinta da Regaleira, it felt like a metaphor for what this trip had been — descending into the unknown, into a place of quiet and reflection. And just like that well, this journey brought me back up, feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to move forward. I realized that rest is its own form of productivity. It’s in those moments of stillness and quiet that we find the clarity we need to truly grow.”
I came on this trip looking for a break, a way to recharge. What I found was that rest isn’t just about doing nothing — it’s about finding the space to reconnect with yourself and to rediscover what brings you joy and peace.
So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this trip, it’s that it’s okay to take a step back. To slow down, to rest, and to reconnect with what really matters. When you give yourself permission to rest, you’re not just recharging — you’re laying the foundation for everything that comes next.

With ample sun, sights, and awesome food, there’s a ton to see and do in Lisbon, Portugal. The real magic of Lisbon comes from exploring its side streets and alleys, but there’s so much to experience all around that a good plan is needed. It’s also a spread out and hilly city, so making the most of it involves some walking and creative use of the public transportation. With a short amount of time or compressed schedule in this glimmering historic city, make sure to make the most of it to see and do the best this city has to offer.

You know when someone has a YouTube video that they want you to watch sooo badly and they SWEAR it is hysterical and that you are going to absolutely LOVE it?
And somehow the more they tell you how much you’re going to love to it, the more it kinda makes you want to not like it out of stubborn principle?
By the time you finally say “fk it” and watch the damn video to get them off your back, you’re forced into one of those super awkward fake laughs just so you don’t hurt their feelings and look like a huge asshole.
Yeah, that’s kinda how I felt about Portugal going into month 3.
I’ll preface this by saying that following Prague would be unfair for any city on our itinerary in my opinion. I had just gotten into a groove by the end of last month and was feeling all of those homey vibes I talked about in my recap post.
It sounds dumb, I know, but I have been feeling the pressure to love Lisbon this first week. I think it’s a combination of how bummed I was to leave Prague, how every site seems to have Portugal in its “Top Destinations for 2017”, and how much people who have been here before told me how much I’m going to like it. Whatever the reasoning, it just didn’t wow me right off the bat.
I’m that annoying kind of person who likes things less when people tell you how you’re going to react to them. It applies to most things — YouTube vids, songs, TV shows, and apparently cities.
I’m fully aware that it’s so stupid and that Lisbon really is incredible…it just took me a couple days to forgive it for being #notprague.
All of that being said, after spending more time in Lisbon and a weekend in Porto, it’s easy to see why Portugal belongs on all of those lists.
Lisbon is the most colorful city that I’ve ever been in. From the purple jacaranda trees to the colorful buildings decorated with brightly colored paint/tile/street art to the rainbow-like sunsets, there’s a ton of things to stare at. I mean, there are even peacocks everywhere.
The vibes from the people in Lisbon have been really incredible. People are friendly, speak good English, and are extremely social.
One of my favorite things so far has been seeing the big groups of people organically congregate around sunset at this spot called Santa Catarina which has an incredible view of the city. Every night people go there to have some drinks, play random instruments, and even sing. It’s a lot of fun to be around.
One of the best parts about moving from place to place every month is the opportunity that each new month gives you to hit the reset button. A lot of people, including myself, were feeling a little doughy leaving Prague because of all the bread, potatoes, and beer that we consumed. Before leaving Prague, our Program Leader, Mama Jen, proposed that mayyyybee this month we put some focus on getting kai-razy fit. Everyone nodded in agreement (and shame) as they took another sip from their Pilsner.
Lisbon has been the perfect place to hit the reset button with the awesome gym that we are all going to, the hills (oh, sweet Jesus, the hills…), the surfing lessons, and the lighter food and beverages.
I’m excited for this month because as a group we are focusing more and more on setting our goals for the year and supporting each other in achieving them. Looking back during the Pre-RY days, I wish I spent more time planning on how to get what I want out of this year and less time on what size of GoToobs I should get (“…but the 2oz ones have the little suction cup thingys and the 3oz don’t!” ← a real internal struggle for me *face palm*).
Also, next month Valentina and I will be going to a weekend retreat that brings together Remotes from different programs for sessions about creating change and developing new habits. Really excited about this.
Fortuitous timing gave us the opportunity to use Remote Year’s newest work space, which just opened last month. It’s got a similar feel to the WiP workspace we had in Split, but it’s different enough to make it feel like its own unique place.
Most importantly, it’s got a quiet room that is reminiscent of the quiet room (called “the library”) that I basically lived in at in the office back in Austin.

One of the things that everyone tells you when you talk about having babies is “no more travelling!”. I’ve always challenged this assumption and thought (and said) “Why? It must be slightly more challenging, but some people do it”. “Oh, you have no idea”.
I would then kind of give up and wouldn’t challenge it too much as I didn’t have babies, so if this was true, I would only understand it once I had them.
And then I had a baby. As we are Portuguese we had to plan our first holidays to visit the family in Portugal, and that meant travelling.
So we planned our first trip to Portugal. By car. From London to Lisbon. With a 3 months old.
Our friends with babies said “You’re crazy! You have no idea what you’re getting into!”. And once again we thought “What’s the big deal?”. But we had never travelled with Dinis so if it was that hard, we would only understand it once we travelled. And so we did.
Our first and most difficult trip was on August 2018 when Dinis was 3 months old. Because we wanted to spend a month in Portugal and we have Mia (our black Labrador) we decided to drive, so she could come with us (I know #crazy).
Was it cheaper than flights and leaving Mia with a dogsitter? Not really. But it was more about having her with us for all that time to be honest. A month is a long time to leave her behind. Was it easy? Nop. Did we survive? Yes. Both on the way to Lisbon and back.
Driving to Portugal from London nonstop takes 21h26 min (according to Google Maps).
We had already done it when we went to Portugal to get married and we took two days (about 12h drive each day). But with Dinis we left London, drove down to France, through to Spain and arrived in Portugal 5 days later (one of the days was a stay-over at my brother’s in France). So a 4 day drive. Double the time we had done before. And why? Well, let me explain.
There’s a few challenges when travelling with a baby in a car.
First, you need to stop every two hours. Babies shouldn’t stay in the car seat for longer than that until they’re 6 months due to risks of suffocation. So João planned a 6 hour of drive per day, with a stop every two hours. So ideally, we would spend about 8 hours a day travelling to a new destination with minimum stops included.
But our drives took about 12 hours each day. And why? Because you should only stop every 2 hours for safety purposes, but a baby has a mind of their own. They’re hungry, they pee, they poop and most of all they get bored and cry about it. Especially when they’re not used to being in a car that often (which is our case, we don’t own a car in London).
So that’s the hardest bit, you need to stop often and irregularly. You also need to be patient and either teach your baby to self soothe to sleep before you travel, during your travel or stop every single time your baby is upset or needs to sleep.
I’m not going to lie, he did get very upset a few times during our travels and at times where we couldn’t stop straight away as we’d miss the exit for a resting area. But the truth is they are not hurting, so you just need to try and calm them down with other distractions until you’re able to make the stop.
With the following travels (by plane), one thing I’ve noticed, is that breastfeeding is great for airplanes but not that great for cars. In a moving car, it’s not safe to take the baby out of the seat and hold them in the car. Should an accident happen (as we all know, these are unpredictable) and the chances of survival drop drastically.
For breastfeeding to work we, we need to feed the babies on demand. So sometimes they might sleep for 2 hours nonstop and have to be waken up, sometimes they feed every 30 min.
That’s when formula (or expressing if you’re good at it and have the patience for it) is a great help. You just need fresh boiled water in a flask, some prepared formula doses, bottles and you’re good to go!
This depends on the babies. Some babies are extremely sensitive to dirty nappies in the first months and will complain about it straight away. Dinis was like that. I understand! It must be just slightly uncomfortable to be sitting in your own pee or poop. Most rest stops will have toilets with changing tables for you to change your baby.
But when they don’t you quickly learn to improvise. I changed Dinis on grass, on a table and a lot of times on my lap whilst sitting in the car. It’s not very easy, and it depends on the size of your baby (I struggled more on the way back to London as he had grown during that month), but it’s doable.
Naps are a bliss. When they happen. I’m sooo glad decided to try and fix Dinis’ sleep before we travelled.
I believe a baby that doesn’t know how to, needs to be taught to sleep. Is it easier said than done? Hell yeah! Can it be done? Hell yeah.
From week 3, Dinis stopped sleeping properly during the day, giving me good nights, but terrible days. I couldn’t do anything. He wouldn’t even like being in the sling for too long as it was a very hot summer in London last year. So, two weeks before travelling and after 2 months of sleep struggle, we had enough and had to do something about it.
I don’t like the Ferber method (leaving your kid to cry on his own), I find it too harsh and I honestly think it wouldn’t work on Dinis (he’s a stubborn one), so I used the Tracy Hogg method (her book is on my Approved tab under the “Mum Books tab”) and we fixed Dinis’ naps during the day whilst his sleep pattern remained unchanged. From barely any sleep during the day, only sleeping on my chest we got to 3 naps a day (one of them a 2 hours nap). And him being able to get to sleep with no “boob aid” was what helped soooo much during our trip. Not that I didn’t breastfed him to sleep a few times. But at least half the time he would go to sleep on his own whilst we were on route with minimal fuss.
Should you have no time to read anything else past this (I know how motherhood works) my top tip for travelling with a baby is the following: Just go.
As with a lot of things in life, the thought of travelling with our baby is scarier and way more difficult than actually travelling with our baby. Because once you’re on route, it’s actually fine. So just grab your baby, and go. Well, prepare a little of course. But don’t let the thought of it stop you from going.
Because we’re two Portuguese living in London, if we want to see our family we need to travel. And since Dinis was born, we made 3 trips to Portugal and went to Prague on holidays. So that “impossible to travel once you have a baby” is nonsense to me. You’re a bit more limited money wise, you need to plan a bit more, but otherwise it’s all good. You just need to be a bit more flexible about your normal routine and not worry about how that will permanently affect your baby: it will not. Babies are sponges, they absorb what’s around them and they will change quickly and more effectively than we adults do. They just go with the flow.
Was this an easy trip? Not really. But would we do this again? Yes, we would. If anything it made us feel brave and made us not fear any other trip we will do with him.
So that’s it. Do it. You and your baby will be fine. And he might not remember much of it, but he will love it and you will have the best memories of it.
Hug, Millia

The ultimate guide to discover Portugal´s hidden gems

Portugal’s capital is having a moment and Americans are taking notice. Lisbon has planted itself on the radar of wealthy U.S. property buyers, drawn in by the city’s charm, affordability, and a rental market that’s too good to pass up. This year alone, at Goldcrest Buyers Agency we had a surge of over 15% on enquiries from US citizens — and I will explain why Lisbon is such an attractive destination for real estate investors.
Particularly for American investors, Lisbon offers the best of both worlds, a charming, laidback lifestyle at a fraction of the living costs as back home, and a favorable property investment scene.
Recently ranked as the sixth most profitable European city for property rentals by Global Property Guide, it’s outshining traditionally popular spots like Paris, Berlin and London. Rental yields in Lisbon averaged 5.65% by mid-2024, a number that’s been steadily climbing thanks to a strong demand from tenants and comparatively lower property prices.
For Americans, especially those used to high costs of cities like New York or San Francisco, Lisbon feels more attainable. High demand, fewer regulatory headaches than other European cities, and a booming tourism industry mean landlords can see real profits. Compared to places like Berlin or Paris, where acquisition costs are steep and rental rules are tight, Lisbon feels more accessible.
Why are Americans moving to Portugal?
Portugal has been quietly climbing the ranks as a destination for Americans looking to relocate, and the momentum is unmistakable. Google searches about “how to move to Portugal” increased by +1100% since 5 November 2024, with more Americans considering relocation than ever before.
This isn’t just a fad. Between January and June of this year, over a million U.S. tourists visited Portugal — a 15% jump from 2023. Meanwhile, the number of Americans living in Portugal grew by 44% last year, reaching over 14,000 by mid-2024. Many are drawn by the promise of a more affordable, slower-paced life.
And for Californians in particular, Portugal feels familiar. The weather is sunny, the coastline is stunning, and the lifestyle is relaxed. But unlike California, Portugal’s cost of living doesn’t break the bank.
Lisbon’s appeal for property investors
Lisbon is more than just a great place to live; it’s a smart place to invest. Tourism is booming, and short-term rental platforms have made it easy for property owners to turn their homes into income-generating assets. That said, this growth hasn’t come without challenges. The demand for rentals has pushed up prices, inciting debate about housing affordability for locals.
Despite this, property experts predict that Lisbon will remain a favorite for investors. Its location, climate, and quality of life make it instant draws for those looking to move abroad. The key for the future will be finding a balance between attracting investors and ensuring affordable housing for everyone.

This isn’t exactly a restaurant review. There are a few reasons why it would never qualify. First, I never knew the name of the restaurant in question. It wasn’t on the outside of the place, and while it was on the menu I don’t speak Portuguese. I don’t even know if the place is still in business. It was 2015 and I was in Lisbon.
The trip was crazy, I was in Lisbon for three days, Madrid for three days, Barcelona for Three days, and Paris for three days. This was day two in Lisbon, after spending a day in Sintra exploring castles.
Lisbon was a new experience for me. I’d travelled a fair bit before, but never to somewhere with that kind of history. Canada doesn’t have a lot of historical buildings. Nothing that goes back more than a few hundred years and even that tends to be historical sites, important buildings, that sort of thing. The other places I’d travelled had, up until that point, been the US, South America, and the South Pacific. None of them have really old buildings that are still in use. Lisbon had houses in the city older than the oldest buildings in Canada and they were still in use. The Airbnb I was staying in was in a courtyard that predates confederation in Canada. The whole neighbourhood was like that.

By: Joel Epstein
I was lucky enough to get back to Lisbon (Lisboa) recently. I can’t get enough of the city, especially in the off season when it’s not overrun with tourists and global nomads looking for a tasty caipirinha or port in Bairro Alto and an evening of Fado in Alfama. I return to Lisboa for both too, but I also visit to ride the Metro and the trams and consider how a hilly city reminiscent of San Francisco gets people around.
As in Madrid and other European capitals, my transit envy for Lisbon always starts with the Metropolitano (Metro) de Lisboa right outside the airport terminals, as it should be.
The ease and comfort of riding the Metro with its cork appointed seats, comes in
contrast to my slog to JFK on an often old A train from Harlem to Lefferts and Liberty, followed by the Q10 Bus to the AirTrain.
Sure, I know I can save a few minutes by taking the A to Howard Beach or the E or LIRR to Jamaica and getting on the AirTrain ($8.25), but why would I? I’d rather budget more time for the trip and buy a couple of Trinidadan doubles for dinner with the money I save making my ride a single fare OMNY trip.
It is rare to get jostled on the Metro in Lisboa the way one might in New York. And getting on and off a crowded train is not the hassle it can be at rush hour on the A or E, or any of our trains for that matter.
Lisboa isn’t a massive city like New York or Los Angeles but like so many global cities I have gotten to know over the years, it seems to have figured out how to match its transit with its commuters’ needs and the city’s often steep topography. Take the romantic trams (amarelos da Carris) that climb up and down Lisboa’s narrow, winding streets. As with the New Orleans streetcars, San Francisco’s cable cars and L.A’s Angels Flight, one doesn’t have to be a transit lover to swoon over these trams.
Of course the Lisboa Metro and the trams aren’t perfect or service as frequent on some lines as it needs to be. One night, heading back to my Airbnb in Arroios, I couldn’t help noticing how packed the train was. Like sardines, as we used to say in New York, or sardinhas, in Lisboa.
The system is also not as disability accessible as it needs to be.
Still, Lisboa and Portugal in general seem years ahead of the U.S. in building a more sustainable transportation network that won’t cost the country the arm and a leg that the Second Avenue Subway extension is going to cost us.
And transit in Lisboa is still improving and growing. The new loop to Campo de Ourique will bring trains to more Lisboetas or Alfacinhas (little lettuces) as Lisboa residents are called.
The dedication to transit is consistent with the country and the E.U.’s commitment to sustainability generally. Portuguese cities are places where residents routinely sort their trash and recycling and best of all, drink their coffee at home or in a café, rather than out of a togo cup.
It was great to get back to Lisboa and it won’t be my last time riding the Metro. And while I am still learning the meaning of saudade, the Portuguese feeling of longing, melancholy, or nostalgia that is supposedly characteristic of the Portuguese temperament, who doesn’t love an airport with bike parking!
Yours in transit,
Joel

I understand in some places of the world, having a car is a must for getting around. Although Lisbon doesn’t fall into that category.
And since I see many people asking if they should rent a car when coming here. I felt like writing this.
So…
Is it worth renting a car when visiting Lisbon?
To honestly answer this question it’s better if you understand a few things beforehand.
Let’s start with the basics.
Why do you need a car?
Are you used to having one available at all times, and you see it as a luxury you can’t let go of? Is there a genuine necessity?
Which area of the city are you staying in, and how do you plan to utilize the car?
For how long will you be in Lisbon? What about Portugal in general?

One month in Lisbon. That’s some 90 meals. Quite a few I prepared at home. What is remarkable is how cheap fruit, vegetables, meat and fish are in Lisbon compared with Australia. Peppers and onions are sweet and cost pennies.
Tuna and Swordfish are about €12-€13 a kilo. It’s a shock to the system.
With cheaper ingredients, property and labour costs it is understandable that Portugal has plenty of quite cheap eats. I say quite cheap as Lisbon isn’t as cheap as you’d expect.
It’s partly that tax is high — 23% compared to Australia’s 10%. And partly that in the inner suburbs around the old town venues are mainly catering to tourists.
Restaurante Ponto Final
R. Ginjal 72, 2800 Almada
I’d rate this as one of the most essential Lisbon experiences together with its rooftop bars. I was recommended it by my old blogging friend Gill. And boy was it good, rustic, generous local dishes in a superb location.
We went for deep fried fish (of some sardine variation), a big bowl of beans with a fishcake -one pot could feed at least two — and a variety of other snacks and wine.
It’s a short ferry hop from Cais do Sodré to Cacilhas and then a 1km walk along a mostly abandoned and graffitied wharf to the restaurant. My only regret is that we didn’t return here.
Open daily 10am-12am
Av. 24 de Julho 49, Portugal Mainly catering to tourists, the Time Out Market is open all day every day and is worth visiting on Sunday and Monday nights in particular when many other restaurants are closed. It has a curated section of high profile local chefs with some stalls doing great value menu do dia.
You can try traditional local dishes such as prego rolls (steak sandwiches, braised ox cheek, bacaloa, pulvo (octopus) and croquetas at the various stalls. You can buy the amazing local Portuguese cheeses, ham, tinned goods, custard tarts and pastries. There’s also sushi, pizza, ice cream.
Seating probably 1,000 people it is a huge space with a really lively buzz. If you can’t decide what to eat, Time Out market will be no help because it will present you with so many choices.
There is a market next door with greengrocers, fish mongers and butchers.
Mon — Thu 10:00–23:00, Fri — Sun 10:00–01:00
106, R. Coelho da Rocha 104, Lisboa
This mercado is the Prahran Market of Lisbon though the focus is more about eating than shopping. It’s got plenty of steak and burger bars. In addition to others doing fish, ceviche and more. It’s a bit more pricy than the Time Out market and has less choice. It’s still fun though.
Saturday mornings
Jardim do Príncipe Real This is the local farmers market. You can buy wine, sensational cheese, ham and fruit and veg. I bought an amazing local bread, heavy enough to sink a blogger. There are also a selection of food stalls where you can eat. It’s worth a Saturday morning stroll here and a coffee at the local kiosk.
R. Dom Pedro V 129, 1250–096 Lisboa
I’ve already said it’s worth stopping for a large G&T or a pisco sour here. It’s also one of the hottest restaurants in town with terrific local variations on ceviche. Arrive early or make a booking.
NB: Don’t order the NZ sauvignon blanc!
R. António Maria Cardoso 58, 1200–330 Lisboa
At first I thought I’d jumped back a decade at Mini Bar as a Ferran Adria Spherified Olive (2004) was delivered. But perhaps that was just my food nerdiness. The food and drink is good and is a diversion from the traditional rustic fare. The menu took us through an excellent selection of curated wines and tapas-style dishes with Japanese influences. There was tiny ice cream cone with sashimi; a single ceviche of prawn served on a lime that you bite into; chicken skin tapas; tuna tataki. Overall this was one of the best dining experiences in Lisbon. Owner José Avillez — a local has other Lisbon restaurants all nearby — Belcanto, Cantinho do Avillez, Café Lisboa, and Pizzaria Lisboa.
R. Duques de Bragança 5, Lisboa
The crust is thin…really thin on these pricy pizzas.
Rua de O Século 242, Lisboa
Recommended by our Airbnb host, Tascardo is very local and great value. I had the steak in a garlic sauce with a fried egg on top. Pam was surprised that the squid came complete with innards and beak. It’s tasty and rustic — as is most Portuguese food.
R. Nova do Almada 95, 1200–288 Lisboa Eventually you will crave vegetables. I mean back home do you only eat meat, fish and potatoes? No. This place, off Lisbon’s main shopping strip, does healthy salads. Top up on vegetables here.
Portugal, R. das Portas de Santo Antão 136, 1150–265 Lisboa  A grungy cafe doing Australian-style coffee and food. Worth a diversion.
Bengal Tandoori Lisboa
Rua da Alegria 23, Lisbon 1250–005
Curry in Lisbon? Why not. After all the Portuguese introduced chillis to India and led to the invention of vindaloo, a sour, hot curry containing pork. From savoury (and sweet for dessert) samosas to vindaloo this is a serious curry shop. You’ll need to navigate windy narrow back streets past a few rowdy African bars.
LX Factory
R. Rodrigues de Faria 103, 1300 Lisboa
Mainly burger joints and interesting reclaimed industrial buildings with various boutiques.

In November of 2017, I attended the Launch in Lisbon program and WebSummit. By the end of that trip, at a stylish and endearingly gritty aftertparty at the Hub Criativo Beato, I declared that I would be moving to Lisbon.
Now that I live here, people often ask why I picked Lisbon instead of a more obvious tech hub. It’s not a simple answer, and I get asked this question enough times that I decided to write this article about it:
I first visited Lisbon in the Spring of 2017 when I was attending several startup events across the EU, including cities such as London, Berlin, Milan, and Zurich. Lisbon was actually my stopover on the way to London; I had eight hours and one local friend to show me a preview of the city. We walked through some of the city’s many scenic areas and had lunch overlooking the river and the 25 de Abril Bridge on a bright sunny day — Lisbon is known for its unique light, among other things. With my extra time I wandered the streets and had a casual meeting at Startup Lisboa to talk about their incubator program. There was something relaxed, warm and inviting about that meeting that left an impression on me as I left to visit other European cities.
In the US there was ongoing political tension and a degradation of values such as Net Neutrality (a free and open internet) and data privacy. I realized that launching a startup in the streaming video space would be more challenging and prone to failure in an already risky field. After researching the major European tech hubs, making several spreadsheets, and visiting startup community events, I was still not sure where it would make sense to base myself out of. So after considering the logical factors, I let all of that go and instead tuned into how I felt physically and emotionally in each city. The memories of the first hours in Lisbon kept appearing, and that was enough to justify the fateful trip where I made the decision.
Lisbon wants foreigners to come and build their companies here. They see new technology startups and even new companies with traditional business models as a way to grow their economy, and they are investing in that.
Lisbon offers a combination of loans and grants through its Portugal 2020 program, where you can receive 0% interest loans for almost half of your company’s initial operating costs without sacrificing any equity. There are also government-sponsored incubators such as Startup Lisboa (full disclosure: I am now in the Startup Lisboa program and a recipient of Portugal 2020 program so I’m totally biased), where you can have an adorable office in downtown Lisbon and mentorship services for a very small monthly cost. I used to have a discounted “hot desk” at a coworking space in New York and now, for the same price, I have an office that can fit four people with a view of a building with azulejos (those pretty tiles associated with Lisbon) and a small balcony where I can see the Tejo river.
The costs for administrative activities and employees is also lower compared to Western Europe and most of the US, but to be fair, I should point out that those costs will increase in the next few years as the Portuguese economy matures and more tech companies more here for “nearshoring” (yes, that’s a thing). Because of the lower operating costs, I am able to bootstrap for a longer period of time and achieve more milestones before giving away equity for investment
Portugal is a crossroads between Europe, the Americas and Africa, and the Lusophone (network of portuguese speaking countries) even extends to some parts of South and East Asia. Why does this matter? Aside from business reasons, it helps Lisbon and Portugal to break away from homogeneous thinking. The LGBT, creative, and entrepreneurial communities often intersect and result in social and cultural amenities that are usually reserved for larger cities.
Portugal’s legendary hospitality and diversity are also a factor that helps Portugal earn the ranking with of best quality of life for expats in the world and helps Lisbon consistently place in the Monocle annual Quality of Life survey. And in the startup scene itself, it lends to a more collaborative, supportive environment rather than a competitive mentality.
Maybe it’s because Portugal and the UK are in the same timezone and have had a peace treaty for over 600 years. It could also be because Portugal’s population is 10.3 million (somewhere between the populations of New Jersey and Pennsylvania) and they don’t expect the world to learn their language. Regardless of the reason, the Portuguese tend to speak really good English. The younger population and tech professionals are almost always fluent. Being a native English speaker is an advantage here, and learning basic Portuguese is sincerely appreciated, but not mandatory.
I’m surprised that the Portuguese speak English with an accent that often sounds more American than British. They tell me that it is because they don’t dub their films and they watch a lot of US TV shows on Netflix.
Also, I should note that many Portuguese people speak three or more languages — usually English, French, Spanish or German in addition to their native tongue. They do not have the same linguistic reputation as the Swiss, but I think they deserve this acknowledgment.
Launching a company in countries with larger populations and strong domestic economies can cause a company to think about only the local market. That doesn’t work very well for a tech startup with global ambitions. In Portugal’s case, they expect you to focus on external markets as soon as you can. And the government has an internationalization program with grants to help you market to other countries.
As I stated previously, Portugal is a crossroads, an international hub that connects to other global markets and cultures despite its relatively small size.
Lisbon is a startup hub that is not held back by old paradigms.
Berlin, London and Paris: they are wonderful places and have thriving startup scenes. But they all have a preconceived notion and a reputation that is hard to change. Lisbon doesn’t have this burden; Lisbon is creating something new, experimenting and evolving as it discovers its niche. The creative class and digital nomads often come from interesting and wealthy countries and choose to move to Lisbon after seeing many parts of the world.
I’ve heard that Portugal is described as the “New California” and Lisbon is the new San Francisco of Europe. I don’t know if I agree with that assessment but I do imagine that Lisbon has the potential to be a futuristic Starfleet Headquarters-type place. A center of innovation, creativity and a place that embodies the human rights and data policies that were outlined in the Treaty of Lisbon. And I think Lisbon has a strong chance of being associated with new media.
Like many startup founders, I might be extra optimistic and biased. I might fail and Lisbon might not reach its potential. But there is a spirit here that continuously encourages me to embrace Lisbon, and Lisbon has already displayed its ongoing level of commitment to me.
Michael Fiorentino is the Founder of Vixtape, which is building a streaming TV service that combines audio, video and data in new ways. He will have a booth at WebSummit and will be VJing several unofficial night events that week in Barrio Alto, Principe Real and Marvila.

If you’re planning a summer holiday, why choose between city or beach? Come to sunny Lisbon and have both!
You find beaches for all tastes around Lisbon. Here’s your ultimate Lisbon beach guide to the main and easily accessible areas.
50 km northwest of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
This quaint fishing village became a Europe’s top surf spot and is one of the four World Surfing Reserves. Its best surf breaks include Ribeira d’Ilhas, Coxos and Pedra Branca. Its Atlantic coastline has a handful of unspoiled beaches great to relax and spend some family time, like Foz do Lizandro and São Lourenço. During the summer, it comes alive with locals and tourists and there’s no shortage of beach accommodation, surf schools and lodges, nightlife spots and seafood restaurants.
30 km northwest of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
This UNESCO site town is widely known for its dream-like palaces. However, north of town and included in a protected area, near picturesque villages with local restaurants serving delicious food you find beaches loved for their wilderness and natural beauty. Adraga, Grande and Maçãs are amongst the best beaches near Sintra.
30 km west of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
In the Portuguese Riviera more than ten Blue Flag beaches have something for everyone — family fun, water sports and great spots for surfing and sports alike. Tamariz and Carcavelos are some of the best-known, and there’s the wild Guincho, a world’s top windsurf location. There are hip surf hostels and schools galore, Europe’s biggest casino, top-class beach hotels and golf resorts. These are the beaches most easily accessible from Lisbon and can get busy during the summer.
15 km south of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
Portugal’s longest strip of sand spreads over 30 km with beaches facing the Atlantic fresh waters. Apart from endless space for sunbathing, you find a variety of watersports including surfing, kitesurfing, windsurfing and scuba-diving, as well as schools and hostels. Affordable seafood, lively beach bars and summer parties complete the scenery for a fantastic sunny time with sand between your toes. During the summer, a small train takes you along 10 km of beaches. As for the other 20 km, car is the best option. The further south you go, the wilder it gets and the fewer people you find. It’s also home to one of the earliest nudist beaches around the capital — Meco.
40 km south of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports
This picturesque fishing town is home to long strips of sand facing calm waters. It’s a popular amongst locals, mainly families attracted by the quiet waters of the sheltered bays. Although it became a popular summer resort known for it beach hotels and fresh seafood restaurants, it retains its fishing atmosphere — you can still see the fishermen selling the day’s catch. Located at the mouth of the Sado River, the sea is rich in fish, being one of the best sport-fishing spots around Lisbon. Amongst its most sought after beaches are Califórnia and Ouro.
45 km south of Lisbon easily reached by car.
The scenery is something you’ll never forget about Arrábida’s beaches — the perfect combination of golden sand, green cliffs, and blue sea.
A natural park covering 108 km2 is home to peaceful sandy coves. Its calm blue waters and the diversity of marine life make it one of the best spots for snorkelling and scuba-diving in Portugal. Its sea caves are also an opportunity for those who enjoy caving and diving. Portinho da Arrábida and Figueirinha are its most famous beaches. If you’re a seafood fan, there are excellent and affordable restaurants.
55km south of Lisbon easily reached by car/ferryboat
This peninsula inspires anyone with its magnificent landscape, formed by the Arrábida green mountains, the Sado estuary and miles of unspoiled dunes. Its long beaches and the calm transparent waters are ideal for families, like the Tróia-mar beach. For a break from the sand, there are tours to watch dolphins playing in the sea, watersports and beachfront resorts with tennis courts and golf courses. A casino and superb seafood restaurants complete the picture, making it a top-notch beach destination. Just count with prices above the average.
70km south of Lisbon easily reached by car/ferryboat
In the small village of Comporta things are as simple as long swathes of sand and calm waters sheltered by dunes and pinewoods. In a protected area that impresses by its natural beauty and wildlife, you find a beach that goes by the same name with everything for a tranquil summer holiday and an invigorating contact with nature. There are golf courses and excellent conditions for bird watching, or you can just take a seaside stroll or hop on a horse for a different view of the sands. You can choose from affordable places to eco-friendly villas and house retreats with a touch of luxury. One thing is sure — compared with Tróia it’s much natural and quieter.

Even before the pandemic, many people, particularly US citizens, have been looking to move somewhere that offered a better quality of life. One of the main criteria is it must be safe, and on the surface Portugal appears to be a good option. Nobody gets killed at school by rampaging gunmen, the country isn’t always at war, or threatening war, and most people aren’t openly aggressive towards people of colour. So, what’s to worry about?
The question of how we learn about the practicalities of immigrating to a new country critically depends on the scope of your enquiries. How deep do you go and how do you rate the sources you use to draw conclusions? My husband and I, both sociologists and writers, lived in Lisbon for three and a half years. We had travelled there several times before and already had a few Portuguese friends before we decided to move. We didn’t speak much Portuguese but it wasn’t our first time starting life in a new country where we didn’t speak the language. We did everything ourselves, there was no relocation agent, and we knew obtaining accommodation, dealing with bureaucracy and getting settled would require patience and a lot of energy. Even having a relocation agent doesn’t count for much, because once you’re settled, the problems don’t end there.

If Portugal invented bureaucracy, Mozambique made it smoke a joint and forget why it walked into the room.
I’ve danced with the bureaucratic devils in both countries — Portugal with its deadly seriousness and love of obscure forms, and Mozambique with its spectacular improvisation, where systems are more suggestion than structure. Neither place is designed to facilitate getting things done. They take different approaches to the art of not getting there.
Let’s start in Portugal. Bureaucracy here is like an elaborate board game where no one explains the rules, the dice are missing, and halfway through, someone switches the language to Legalese. You show up with everything you were told to bring, plus a few extras (because you’ve been burned before). The clerk glances at your papers, sighs, and says you’re missing a Declaração de Existência, a certificate proving you still exist — and no, your breathing presence isn’t proof enough.
Everything must be official. Preferably signed and ideally stamped. A document without a stamp is like a Portuguese coffee without sugar: technically functional, but deeply unsatisfying to the authorities.
Now, contrast this with Mozambique. I spent years navigating state offices, where everything takes longer, but somehow no one is in a rush. Want a driving licence? That’ll take weeks. Maybe months. Possibly a goat. You learn to bring your pen, paper, and, ideally, someone who knows someone. In Mozambique, the system is more about who you know than what you know or even what you need.
There, it’s less paperwork and more social performance. A good handshake and a wide smile can accelerate a process faster than a notarised form. People nod solemnly, take your papers, disappear into the back for what feels like a pilgrimage, then return and say: “Come back tomorrow. Maybe.”
I once went to collect a simple residency document in Maputo. The office had no electricity, but a woman behind a desk was still diligently stamping papers. I asked how she was managing. She lifted the stamp, thudded it onto a blank form, and said: “We stamp first. Later, we figure out what it was for.”
Efficiency? No. But creativity? Absolutely.
In Portugal, the power lies with the rules. In Mozambique, power lies with the person holding the stamp pad — usually someone sipping tea behind a dusty desk who may or may not be in today, depending on the weather, the fuel supply, or their cousin’s wedding.
Portugal loves the illusion of control. Everything is digital now… sort of. There’s a national portal, multiple logins, security codes sent by SMS, and inevitably, a crash right when you need it most. You try to upload a form, and the system tells you the document is too large — it’s a one-page PDF. You call the helpline, and they suggest using Internet Explorer in 2025.
Meanwhile, in Mozambique, the system has already crashed weeks ago. The printer doesn’t work. The person who knew the password is on leave. But someone will eventually scrawl your details in a giant ledger with the confidence of a 16th-century monk, and you’ll leave with a semi-official-looking slip of paper, possibly signed with a Bic pen and blessed by chaos.
The difference is in tone. Portuguese bureaucracy takes itself very seriously. Everything must be done properly, even when it doesn’t work. Especially then. In Mozambique, no one pretends the system works. It’s acknowledged with a laugh, a shrug, and a story.
And maybe that’s the heart of it. In Portugal, the system is king, cold, stubborn, and demanding. In Mozambique, the system is a rumour, and the people are the real structure holding everything together. That may sound romantic, but it also means nothing is predictable, and everything is negotiable.
So, which is worse? Honestly, it depends on the day. In Portugal, I leave the office frustrated but eventually successful, clutching my over-stamped document like a war medal. In Mozambique, I leave smiling, document-free, and slightly unsure what just happened — but someone offered me cashew nuts and called me mana.
Different brands of chaos. Same familiar headache.
If you enjoyed this tangled tale, stick around. There’s plenty more where this came from — with laughs, insights, and a few more hair-raising adventures on life, parenting, work, and everything in between.

I wasn’t sure I wanted to go. We’ve been to many ruined castles before. It’s just walls, right?
Castelo de São Jorge is pretty much at the top of Lisbon, the city of seven hills, with a steep climb required to reach it. On top of it all, it is scorching in the middle of July — do we really want to go?
In the end, what decided it was that we arrived on a Monday. And most Lisbon museums are closed on Mondays.
We didn’t know — one of the gaps in our research — and didn’t have alternate plans ready.
Another factor was that it was open until 9 pm, and we could be there at sunset. We were jet lagged and needed to crash first, and then find something not too demanding to do at the end of our first day.
We set off around 6:30 pm, following Google’s directions along the twisted and meandering streets. There was a free elevator (Elevador Castelo) about halfway point which allowed us to gain a bit of altitude without climbing. We got there closer to 7 pm — and stayed until the end because it was just spectacular.

On my request, my VA compiled a list of museums in and around Lisbon for me. The Museu de Marinha (in Belem) is free on the 1st Sunday of every month (which today, Oct 1, happens to be) so I decided to check it out. I did pay the extra for the temporary exhibition Vikings although it wasn’t as educational or even as entertaining as I expected it to be so I don’t recommend it. In fact, if you have a Netflix subscription, watch the series Vikings (its gruesome and probably inaccurate but definitely entertaining)
As for the Museu de Marinha itself, I highly recommend it. Here are some of my random thoughts and photographs of the visit.
The entrance itself is impressive with a tall ceiling of many (probably unnecessary) arches. Beneath it sits a statue of Prince Henry (Infante D. Henrique) who is credited with launching the Age of Discoveries for Portugal.
There’s also a giant map behind him of the Portuguese exploration. Naturally, I was curious about their conquest of Goa so I zoomed in for a closer look.
According the the map, there’s a route taken by Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500 from Portugal to Brazil, then past the Cape of Good Hope onwards to the East Coast of Africa and finally Goa. Vasco da Gama it seems, went straight to Cochin. Some day soon I will research more about these sea routes.
The museum has a large variety of ship models progressing from charming early 14th century merchant ships all the way to the less-impressive 21st century destroyer ships and submarines.
It was a bit disappointing to see the transition of ships as vessels of exploration and commerce into vessels of war over the years.
I did however find a small label in the exhibit that mentioned the “myth” of the School of Sagres.
Since I had never heard of this School before, I believe the myth even more now.
(hint: This could be the start of a great Dan Brown novel)
If you like Museums and you’re in/around Lisbon, here’s the map i referred to earlier with information about free days and museum timings. Feel free to use and share.
Also, completely irrelevant yet important — if you have a problem remembering and managing your passwords for your 50+ online accounts, here’s a solution that I’ve been using for over 3 years now and can’t live without. It’s called Dashlane and if you use my referral link here you will get $20 off your Premium subscription (there’s also a free version)

Kanazawa opens everyday for dinner. On a good day, it sits eight customers. On a bad day too. How a tiny restaurant with pricey menus, slow service and a strict reservation policy is challenging its industry’s dogmas.
Tomoaki Kanazawa started cooking in 1985. In 1993 he was invited by the Japanese Ambassador in Portugal to come to Lisbon as the Embassy Chef. Years later he opened his own restaurant, Tomo, that would become a reference in traditional Japanese cuisine in Lisbon.
However, Tomoaki wasn’t happy. He believed that when customers visited his restaurant they should feel as if they were eating at someone’s home but, because he was serving over 100 meals at lunch and dinner, he couldn’t spare a minute to be with them, so he couldn’t provide them with that kind of experience. So he took a bold step: he left Tomo to his employees and, together with his wife Kayo and his daughter Sakura, he opened Kanazawa, the 8 seat restaurant that set up a whole new standard for high end cuisine in Lisbon and may well become a business case study.
1. You can make customers work for your product
Kanazawa’s first management lesson is that you don’t need to make your customers’ lives easy, what you need is to have a product they want so badly they will work hard to get.
The waiting list is months-long. When I was there in November, I overheard a fellow customer saying that he was trying to make a reservation since August. Not only that, but the booking experience is in itself a challenge. You can’t book a table over the phone, the reservations are to be made online. After providing your contact information, you must select three alternative dates for your visit. Then, you have to confirm that you agree with the cancellation policy, which states that, if you cancel your reservation in the 3 day-period prior to the confirmed date, you will pay a cancellation fee, which starts at 60% of the price of the menu if you cancel 3 days before and rises up to 100% if you cancel on the same day. After confirming your agreement, your credit card number is requested, which is to ensure that, if you actually decide to cancel within that 3-day period, the fee is credited from your account.
Finally, you must choose one of the four different menus, prices ranging from 60€ to 150€. It is almost impossible to grasp the differences between the menus, as the dishes names are in Japanese and there are no pictures to illustrate them. Calling the restaurant won’t work either (I tried), as the language barrier is there too. My very simple solution for this complex problem was to google every dish on each menu, go over the available pictures, and create a global understanding of what to expect.
This extenuating process sends a strong message to the customer: The restaurant is opening for eight people only, and you are one of them. From the moment we accept your reservation, we are deeply committed to provide you with the best experience we can create. Make sure to honor your commitment too. It might sound harsh, but it is easy to understand if you refer back to Tomoaki’s vision: when you visit his restaurant you should feel as if you were eating at his home. So think about it, if you were invited to an 8-guest dinner party at a friend’s place and he was counting on you to bring the wine, would you lightly cancel on the same day?
2. You can invest time on your customers
Kanazawa’s second management lesson is that time spent preparing and delivering a personalized experience to your customers is never — ever — wasted.
When I arrived at Kanazawa, Kayo took my coat and showed me where I was supposed to sit. While I was seating I was stunned to notice that there was a small, handwritten name tag with my name on it, right next to a line-up of the courses, also handwritten, with that day’s date on it. It is a small gesture that immediately makes you feel special and welcome. Someone took the time to write this for me, I thought.
The eight seats are placed around the sushi bar. Tomoaki served the first course, calmly explaining what it was, where the ingredients came from (more on that in a second), and how to taste it. The ritual is repeated every time a new course is served. Even though he alternates between groups of customers, he is able to make each group feel unique, as if he was there just for them.
At Kanazawa desserts are cooked by Kayo, so she takes over when the time comes to serve and explain them. She goes individually to each group and speaks in a really soft, delicate manner, that somehow makes you feel all the careful dedication that was put into each of the tiny portions of cake, mousse and ice-cream, all made from local ingredients. She then brings in a small portion of handmade candy, served in a mirrored-plate and accompanied by the tiniest origami I’ve ever seen (someone did this for me, I thought). Before leaving, you still get a package of homemade cookies to take home.
The whole service is perfectly adapted to the rhythm of each group, as if someone was keeping an attentive eye to make sure that you would neither be rushed nor have to wait too long. This probably has something to do with the fact that Tomoaki designed the whole experience based on the Japanese tea ceremony inspired by Sen no Rikyu. I arrived at Kanazawa at 8.30pm and left at 11.30pm, feeling that it was still 9.30pm, just like would have happened if I was having dinner at some old friend’s place. Tomoaki and his family spent 3 hours of their evening with me. And I can’t wait to go back.
3. You can work with your family
Kanazawa’s third management lesson is that working with your family doesn’t have to be a tense experience for all of those involved — it can actually be quite peaceful.
If you’ve ever watched or read about Netflix’s Chef’s Table, you know that family plays a big part in Chefs’ careers. Families can either be the solid foundation or the constant source of pressure, questioning, and regret for great Chefs around the world.
Kanazawa employs three people, and they are all related. You might expect that this simple fact could in itself result in a not so simple work dynamics, but that is not the case — at all. In fact, all the processes and rituals are so well coordinated among Tomoaki, Kayo and Sakura that you barely hear them speak to each other. Or get into each other’s space. Sakura mostly helps her father in the kitchen, but she doesn’t need to be told what to do. She just knows the rhythm and plays according to it. She moves graciously at precise moments. Kayo works her way around customers, picking up finished courses, delivering new tableware, serving tea, so discretely that you can barely hear her steps. It’s almost as if they are dancing a secret family dance. You don’t know the moves but it is just beautiful to watch.
Their working choreography not only looks peaceful from the outside, it actually makes you feel calm and relaxed, as when you visit a couple of friends at their place and they naturally take turns going to the kitchen to prepare the meal, just to make sure that you are not left alone in the living room. One of them is always keeping you company. That’s how you feel at Kanazawa too.
4. You can buy from local vendors
Kanazawa’s fourth management lesson is that it is possible to run a successful business making it a principle to buy from small local vendors.
Tomoaki not only selects Portuguese fish for his restaurant, he makes sure that each species’ origin is well-known to the customers. One of the highest moments of the dining experience comes when he opens up a wood box containing different fish species, perfectly cut and prepared, and talks in great detail about the provenience and seasonality of each of them, so that the customer can make a well informed choice about the nigiris he should prepare. Most of the vegetables and fruits used have Portuguese roots too. What his suppliers have in common, beyond the nationality, is the compromise towards sustainable production.
This is one direct consequence of Kanazawa’s very unique operating model. Working in a 100-seat restaurant means preparing food three or four days in advance. You don’t actually know how many people will come (even those who made a reservation can cancel or simply don’t show up) and what they will eat, so you need to have a huge stock in place and proceed with as much setting up as possible. Tomoaki, on the other hand, not only has eight customers per night, but he also knows beforehand what they will be eating and he can be quite sure that they will come. So he can focus on preparing the best — not the cheapest nor the fastest — meal his customers can have, and he can buy fresh ingredients and source them locally.
Isn’t that what anyone who has guests over does? Buying ingredients from a market or supermarket that is trustworthy and close to home and preparing the meal just before the guests arrive? If you’ve ever been in the host position, you know how good it feels to look for and cook the best ingredients you can find. But as a guest, you also know how good it feels to have a simple but thoughtful meal put together just for you. And this is where Tomoaki’s brilliance reveals itself once again: you feel that, by putting all this focus in looking for the best ingredients, he is concerned with putting a thoughtful meal together for you.
All in all, Kanazawa’s main take-away lesson for business is this: if you have a strong vision for your product, invest your time on crafting and delivering a personalized experience for your customers, create a safe and calm working environment, and stay true to your principles, you can focus on what really matters, which is to turn your work into a permanent state of passion.

Lisbon… I have arrived to this wonderful city two years ago and fell in love with it at the first glance. Lisbon was like my beloved man, like my lover and my soulmate who was waiting for me for all his life, waiting patiently for me to come. I remember that wonderful day in April 2013, I remember that moment when the plane was about to land and my knees started to shiver….. I had a strange feeling that I am coming home but not going for a vacation to an amazing country with a very old and rich history. And I guess I was right…… because 2 years later (as I was coming back over and over again to see my beloved Lisbon) I have relocated here.
I love this city and this amazing country for its marvellous landscapes, incredible beaches, breath-taking nature, magnificent sunsets and wonderful sky. Yes, sky. If you have travelled a lot I bet you noticed that sky and clouds in every country are different. But if you have been to Portugal at least once you will never forget its sky, because you will not be able to find something like that in any other place. I would like to share with you my impressions and experience from the places I have visited in Portugal, about the beauty of this country, its history, its architecture and its magnificent charisma, yes charisma because Portugal for me is not just a country, it is like a lifetime partner who is always happy with you, for you and feels saudade (beautiful juicy Portuguese word which actually has no direct translation but describes a deep emotional state of nostalgia for something or someone you really love, e.g. your motherland or beloved person, something important and significant) when you leave it.
For many years it was a forgotten city. It endured a very long dictatorship; and later it accumulated errors of urban planning. :) Nowadays Lisbon is a city with an odd geography comprising different villages, connected by a incomprehensible system of streets, alleys, lanes, travessas (small, narrow but very cosy streets) abandoned tram lines. Perhaps it is the city where it is impossible to make plans at all; because the city grabs you, hugs you and whispers to your ears lots of crazy ideas even if you have strict plans and you need to stick to them. You might have a walk downtown because you have an appointment there with a friend or a lesson of Portuguese language close to Rua Augusta but then… suddenly you just make a turn to the street you haven’t been before to grab a coffee and suddenly beauty of new unknown street devours you completely, you call your friend and ask to join you immediately or you give a call to language school to reschedule the lesson because now you have to explore the beauty you haven’t seen before. And this is a way much more important than studying. :)
Lisbon loves you a lot, you feel this love, you swim at it, and you feel it with your heart, your skin, your fingertips and your soul. Lisbon hugs you and whispers wonderful words to your ears, he sings fado (incredibly beautiful traditional music and songs in Lisbon, which refers to saudade as originally fado are songs about loss and missing something important) for you, he offers you amazing food, and you feel overwhelmed with this city. That is how I felt from the very first minute I have spent in Lisbon. If you come here once and stay for living you realise that in this city you live like the days were never-ending and Lisbon is a boyfriend who does not forgive your absence. Because today you need to be in Gulbenkian museum because the new exhebition is just starting, and at the same day there is a wonderful indie rock band performing in Bairro Alto, and tomorrow you need to wake up early because you have classes but you have no time to study at all because this city offers so many things every day. You need to go to that new restaurant of seafood which has just opened downtown, then your friend has a launch of a book, then you were thinking of going to Alfama and making some great photos, and finally your friend from Germany is calling and saying that she has a day off and you need to go to Carcavelos for surfing. And you have so many things to do, which you REALLY need to do and you have an early morning yoga class. BUT, You cannot resist this city and you are never tired of all the activities he offers you and you cannot refuse all this as you might offend him. But your love for it is so huge and you need to be there for this city all the time so you just flow with it and its rythm.

Lisboa
Is a trip to Lisbon complete without a taste of Natas? or a trip to the Pena Palace? or a visit to the Tower of Belem popularly referred to by the locals as the Torre de Belem? I could go on and on because there is just so much to do in Lisbon in two days, which was all the time we had to spend there.
The visit to Lisbon, Portugal was a short and sweet one, with my oldest friend of 22 years. We spent the first night having a fancy dinner at the Tivoli restaurant (I recommend this restaurant, the service and food were amazing) on Liberdade avenue. Also on Liberdade avenue, you will find many name brand stores, as well as other 5-star hotels.
On the first day, we did a Lisbon city tour through a one hour Tuk Tuk ride. Frankly, I sometimes think this is a better option compared to the hop on hop off buses because of the intimacy and flexibility it offers. We rode through the Alfama district, stopped by the highest viewpoints in Lisbon for a phenomenal aerial view of the city. We went past the Cathedral church of Lisbon where several wedding ceremonies are conducted at once during the San Antonio Festival in June. We also went past the famous Cristiano Ronaldo Bistro and Bar, a stop for a drink at the bar would have been nice, but that did not happen.

I arrived in Lisbon a little over one month ago to start my Erasmus semester abroad. I had previously not visited Lisbon but had heard incredible things, so when I arrived, I wanted to see it all for myself. I couldn’t wait to get out and get active making use of the last summer days in September/October. I found myself immersed by a city full of beautiful old buildings, cobbled streets (old streets of Alfama), viewpoints (Miradouro Santa Catarina, Nossa Senhora de Monte are two favourites) and rooftop bars at sunset (Park, Topo, LX), great contemporary art (Museu Coleção Berardo) not to mention the surfing (Costa de Caparica) and most importantly the incredible nightlife here (cheap drinks in Bairro, great electronic music at Lux and a festival called Brunch). But hands down the best aspect of Erasmus is the exposure to new people, new cultures, new languages and most importantly new food!
But, me being me…I just can’t seem to ignore my keen interest in startup’s and Lisbon’s thriving ecosystems makes it even harder to ignore. Once I got confirmation of my place here at NOVA , I quickly added Web Summit to the list of ‘must-dos’ whilst here. Building on my past work at Leade.rs and VivaTech earlier this year (check out my medium profile). I am very much looking forward to being part of their Live team covering social media for this momentous event — boy do we have a task. Previously based in Dublin — 2016 was the first year Lisbon hosted the event and what an event it was…attracting 53,000 people, 15,000 companies, 7,000 CEOs and 700 investors it became Europe’s largest tech conference, and it’s poised to grow in 2017. This all demonstrates that Lisbon is not only capable but eager and yearning to establish itself on the world stage as a leader in creativity, technology, and innovation.
Paddy Cosgrove Web Summit founder put it well…‘Lisbon is like Berlin five years ago, but with a southern European climate.’
Currently Lisbon is a rising star and an underdog — ranked by Allianz as the fifth-best-performing startup community in Europe, ahead of front-runners like Stockholm and Dublin. In fact, according to Preqin, the number of VC deals closed in Lisbon 2016 jumped sixfold from 2015, delivering it’s best year yet $18.5 million spread across 9 deals. But that is just the tip of the iceberg — the Portuguese have had to make do without swaths of international investment which countries like the UK and Germany have received and that has translated into making Lisbon one of the best locations to bootstrap a startup.
One of Portugal’s main attractions is the combination of low-cost of living and high quality of life, two things that are very rarely found in one of Europe’s capital cities. On top of that, the OECD considered it the 3rd easiest country to start a company. This makes it makes it cheaper and easier to build great products utilising their highly skilled and ubiquitous talent. Fun fact: Lisbon has the highest percentage of founders with Masters or Ph.D. a whopping 82%.
Their rich history also plays its part, their Age of Discovery inspires a sense of exploration and due to Portugal’s small size; it fosters an outwardly focused mindset. It’s this very mindset which makes startups here think ‘international from day one’ giving them access to a larger addressable market, vital to startup scalability. According to the 2017 Startup Genome Report, Portuguese startups have high proportion of customers from outside Europe. A great example being F*ck Marry Kill, the gamified dating app, was founded in Lisbon but also enjoys popularity in German markets too. Furthermore, another advantage is how widespread and well spoken English is here, EF reports English proficiency at 59.68%.
Picture yourself – considering all of the above whilst relaxing in the hot summer sun after a surf on a stunning beach; sipping a caipirinha and eating some freshly caught and perfectly cooked seafood —then you know how it feels to live in Portugal.
It’s international accessibility, low cost of living and enriching lifestyle is catching ever more attention of global talent and press. All of these factors coalesce to accelerate the momentum it has recently accumulated — but to become sustainable, the ecosystem needs founders to nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs by spreading their knowledge and expertise through mentorship and re-investment.
A vital channel for mentorship, funding and networking is incubators such as, Beta-i producing 40 startups and raising more than $166million. They have worked with over 500 startups and run various acceleration programs, including Beta-start and Lisbon Challenge which attract applicants from 60 countries.
Canopy City a social impact-focused coworking space and incubator.
Impact Hub part innovation lab, part business incubator, and part community center.
BET Ventures an events company aimed at empowering entrepreneur’s.
StartUP Lisboa a government body focused on scale-up innovation. Check out their #ThisisPortugal campaign below.
Talkdesk, joined 500 startups — received 21 million dollars of investment from Salesforce.Uniplaces, a disruptive force in the student accommodation industry that started in Lisbon and has spread to 30+ European cities — raised $24 million Series A last NovemberCLICK HERE for more.
In many ways Lisbon feels like Europe’s version of San Francisco — not to mention the look-a-like Golden Gate Bridge, tanned surfers, streetcars and hills (lucky no sharks though).
Sheffield’s Universities Portuguese partner and my host university, Nova School of Business and Economics is in the unique position of having a great interface with the Lisbon startup community due to their newly opened NOVA Venture Lab, running its flagship Zero Gravity incubator/accelerator programme designed to invest in and develop innovative startups both nationally and internationally.
This innovative mindset filters into their teaching here too. In particular one of the main driving forces behind this renewed perspective and practice is Miguel Munñoz Duarte my Entrepreneurship professor and CEO of iMatch an innovation, marketing and sales focused collaborative consultancy. He has great connections to the vibrant ecosystem here and often arranges guest speakers to shine some light on the practical workings of the methodologies and techniques that we learn. A great example of this was our first guest Christian Vismara — a product manager at Build-Up Labs who came to talk to our class about his role there and specifically his work on F*ck Marry Kill.
First off, Build Up Labs is a Lisbon based Startup Studio also known as a Venture Builder — they create startups from start to finish (wherever that may be). A Venture builder is an all in one ideation, building/development, and growth house. They leverage a lean process and a cross-disciplinary team using shared resources to grow successful businesses. Think of it as the diametric opposite of ‘all your eggs in one basket’ — instead their approach is ‘put lots of eggs in different basket and nurture them until they either fly or die.’
Recently parent Startup birdie (Build Up Labs) celebrated it’s first successful hatch and fly- in other words, their first exit with NVY.LIFE to L’Oreal, it’s a beauty and lifestyle club via blog/news/app — they help readers to realise the best versions of themselves. Check it out HERE.
Christian however, talked a little more about F*ck Marry Kill (FMK) — dubbed “Tinder of the university students” by Jornal de Notícias and as the name suggests, it’s not your standard dating service it’s a game that is designed not to be taking seriously and is best at making it more fun to meet new people. They are now attracting a growing and addicted user base in Portugal and Germany too. In total, they have 72,600 users and has already registered 1.2 million hits and more than 550,000 messages sent.
tapmyback — a peer-to-peer motivation and feedback tool for teams. ToyToy a kids toy product discovery app.CLICK HERE to check out their Portfolio.
“The only thing worse than starting something and failing…is not starting.” — Seth Godin
Startup is a game of failure and if you fail, you learn and if you learn, you succeed. At Build Up Labs they strongly head the words above. Un-afraid to talk about their past mistakes they view their failures as a portfolio of experience and after all, their motto is…
“Grow fast or kill fast”
The venture building model was new and interesting to me, so after the great talk Christian gave; I approached him to find out more…I was invited to visit their office in the up-and-coming industrial end of town, Marvilla which is located in a co-working space called The Hood — I was introduced to all the members of the team; Rui Gouveia CEO, João Duarte data scientist, João Pereira and Salvador Barros, I am really excited to help develop their social profile and produce an effective strategy.
CLICK HERE to find out more about the venture building model.
Finally, I have to say that I have never felt such a strong affinity to a city, let alone the one I luckily chose to study in. There is so much to do and see and it’s impossible to tire of it. A trip to Oporto is next on the agenda.

A. interested in startup/tech/innovation
B. going to web summit C. need a social media helping hand.

Welcome to a new edition of the Tales of Ink and Light. In this one, i flip through the pages of a classic photobook and find echoes of the poetry that attracted me to Lisbon.
A decisive factor in my decision to move to Lisboa was the poetic atmosphere that i had felt while walking up and down its streets during a few short-ish stays. Often when i leave the house, i am unexpectedly reminded of that impalpable yet intensely real thing that exudes from the city.
I find it hard to define (and there is also the fact that i’d be reluctant to name it with precision, even if it were possible). It may be the colours of the walls, it may be the light, it may be a smell, it may be certain clothes people wear, it may be the sounds, it may be attitudes or certain sentences, and the river is certainly a part of it. It is these small things that suddenly appear to incarnate the soul of the place and make you think — oh, yes, indeed, i’m here, this is it. It is the sort of inescapable feeling that seems impossible to describe and that you can only understand if you’ve experienced it personally time and time again.
‘Lisbon, you know…’ is a sentence i read in a poem that appears in Lisboa, cidade triste e alegre (‘Lisbon, sad and joyful city’), a photobook that started as a series of booklets sent to subscribers by post (at the time, it was a way to circumvent the censorship of the dictatorial regime) and later rose to fame after being prominently featured in Martin Parr and Gerry Badger’s History of the Photobook. A modern facsimile edition…

I’m just back from the WebSummit in Lisbon. I had never been to Lisbon before but I’ve heard that they have great trails. As much as I’m a technerd and the WebSummit is an massive tech party with endless happenings, there was no way they were going to keep me off the trails all the week! I’ve heard the call of the trails! I contacted WERIDE and booked a full day guided ride including rental bike, at the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, approximately 25km north-west of Lisbon. I knew that I was pushing it doing a full day Enduro ride after three days of late nights and many drinks..But,
to bike or not to bike — was not even the question..
I was picked up by Hugo, the owner of WERIDE who took me to Miguel, my guide for the day. My trail monster for the day was a YT Capra with an amazing Öhlins rear shock. A Swedish rear shock for a rare Swedish guy, now that’s how you roll!
After an espresso and a Pastel de nata at the little town of Arneiro, we started the fifty minute non-stop climb up to the trailhead. It was raining and humid but the air was fresh and the surrounding forrest was green and lush. I had asked for Enduro, and enduro is what I got. No Enduro without the obligatory climbs before the fun..
The trailhead, and actually all trails in Sintra all starts next to “Tholos do Monge”, a mass grave built in the Chalcolithic period (2300 BC / 2000 BC) at the top of one of the highest elevations of the Sierra de Sintra. From the top you have a network of 25 different Enduro/HD style trails all decending down the mountains in different directions.
It is very hard to describe the Sintra forrest. It is something like a cross-over between a jungle and a Mediterranean forrest. This coupled with a misty carpet hovering a few meters above your heads turns the whole ride into a mystical-magical journey.
After a fantastic descent on the trails filled with fun obstacles, drops and flow trails, we climbed back up again to connect to another fun DH trail. I stopped counting the climbs up and down the mountain but the fantastic descents was the reward for the long climbs.
After a well deserved freshly grilled mackerel lunch at “the Bikers Refugee” in the small city of Penedo, we started the devilish climb back up to the top for our final long descent.
The Donkey trail starts at the top on Peninha, a very remote and isolated chapel overlooking the Atlantic with stunning views.
Words cannot justify the stunning views around Peninha. But best of all is the amazing descent.
After all the climbs I was ready for the long, breath taking descent to the towards the sea.
What goes up must come down. And that is a good thing!
We finished off the ride with a cold beer where we had parked. It could not have been better.
I’m glad that I took a day off the WebSummit craziness for a ride in Sintra despite being very tired from the outset. It was an amazing experience. Magical forrest, endless cool trails and a fantastic guide. I can definitely recommend to anybody who wants to ride in Portugal to contact WERIDE. These guys are pure Pros, attentive, fun and can adapt to any rider style from beginners to Pro-riders. XC, DH or Enduro, whatever makes you tick. They also know how to spice up the ride with espresso, lunch and a beer just at the right time when you really need it. They have top level, state-of-the art well serviced bikes and are very affordable, so it makes absolutely no sense to bring your own bike.
They do: half-day, full-day rides and also organize multiple days or week long rides all over Portugal. They even have their on RVs for maximum comfort for the longer rides. Enduro Magazine just came back from a couple of days with them and published this great piece.
I will definitely come back and I recommend mountain bikers who are searching for their next adventure to go and discover Portugal. You will not regret it.

We just returned from a short business trip to Lisbon with my husband. It was our first time visiting the city, and I can’t help but share this story.
We visited Lisbon right after our relocation to The Azores, San Miguel Island. It’s also Portugal but far from the mainland and is located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean but it’s another story… Since we had not visited this country before it was interesting to compare both locations, and got to know the capital of Portugal and the mentality of the locals.
The airport is right in the city, 30 minutes from the center, which is very handy and saves you time.
The old part of the city is pretty compact and no need to use transportation. It’s very nice to walk around. By the way, did you know Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world? And it’s worth the stroll, but most of the main sights in Lisbon could be seen in 2 days.
Lisbon is a relatively compact city, but it’s still a good idea to stay as centrally as possible!
Chiado and once again Chiado, and the area surrounding it!!!
It has a really wonderful, relaxed vibe. Everything is extremely close here. We were staying at 9 Hotel Mercy and were completely satisfied with the location and hotel.
If you want to save some money you can choose areas a little farther from the center such as Avenidas Novas and Alcantara — they are also good for long-term living. But in this case, you will need to use transportation.
The first thing I recommend after you leave the hotel is to have a glass of Vinho Verde — “Green wine” — which is a traditional Portuguese wine produced exclusively in the northwest of the country. It is lightly sparkling and low in alcohol. It’s really good!
Ginjinha. Trying ginjinha in Lisbon is a travel must. Actually, it’s a cherry liqueur that originated in Lisbon. A lot of bars serve ginjinha in small cups made of dark chocolate. Drinking can be fun.
Below I’ll share a list of dishes I’ve tried, of course, it could be longer, but I was only there for a few days. Plus, we had excellent breakfasts at the hotel.
Perhaps I would have started listing famous tourist attractions in the past, but it’s not so important to me now. I don’t like the fuss about it. Besides, such places are always so crowded!
Instead of visiting the famous Elevador de Santa Justa, standing in an endless line, and then in the small and stuffy elevator car (I googled and saw pictures of tourists), I’ll choose to sit in a nearby rooftop bar with a panoramic view of the same elevator and enjoy the wonderful view!!!
It’s good to read a few articles or watch a video before the trip to manage your expectations. Make a few marks on the map of places you want to visit.
I really couldn’t imagine traveling without a long list of must-see sights. But now I open up a google map with my marks on it and choose on the spot what place I want to visit depending on the mood. And that’s fine.
If I want to learn more about the city and its history, the best way to do it is to book a city tour for a few hours with a private guide who lives in this city and can share some personal stories from life.
From the beginning, it became clear that there was no point in comparing mainland Portugal and San Miguel Island. Yes, it is one country, but so different in so many ways!Generally, I like that Lisbon is lively enough and full of locals even in the city center. But a few things that were a little embarrassing to me are the tourists’ and emigrants' way of behaving, and it wasn’t just downtown. I would describe it as unbridled and disrespectful which makes the atmosphere around a little bit cold and not friendly. These are my personal remarks you might not even notice it, but my empathy didn’t allow me to ignore such things.
This city is a really nice place for tourists, but I would think twice about long-term living.

Hello World! — Excited to share with you how my first week in Lisbon with Remote Year went.
The City: Two words: Hills and Festivals. There are hills everywhere. Lisbon is the stairmaster city incarnate — I swear, we are all going to have nice butts at the end of this month. June is also a great month to visit because of all the festivals! All the charming little districts (Alfama, Bica, Bairro Alto, Castelo & Mouraria) bring the party to the streets to celebrate St. Anthony. Grilled sardines, bread with sausage, red wine, music and entertainment fill the streets for the entiremonth.
The Workspace: It’s a 10 minute walk from my apartment and folks shuffle in and out depending on their schedules.
The Gym: Fitness Hut: a 3 minute walk from the workspace and 55 Euros for 5 weeks. The biggest adjustment for me (other than not having my trainer Cheyne to keep an eye on me) is having to ration your water because there are no water fountains! You’d think they’d want to make sure you stay hydrated…
The Routine: Currently non-existent. When I wake up, go to sleep, eat, work out, code, and study vary at different hours of the day every single day. I guess my routine is: Do what you want when you want — I can’t lie, it’s fucking great.
The Work Situation: The UpWork profile is up but I’m having trouble even finding work to submit bids/proposals for. Most of the jobs require the freelancer to be physically located in the U.S and anything remotely related to Finance requires a lot of Strategy and Business Development experience, none of which I really have. I wallowed a bit for a few days: I realized that my resume was top-notch for a Corporate Finance job but unfortunately only that. Smaller and more nimble firms want someone that can not only manage Budget, Pacings, Close from an Operational side but also someone that can do Strategy, Business Dev and even some sales; coding experience would be a huge plus. It’s been a humbling experience for sure…
The Coding: The plan is to go through the free version of CodeAcademy (current progress at 35%) before I commit to the paid version. PluralSight was recommended as well so we’ll see. Luckily, I’ve got a team of software engineers on this program who are all so willing to help throughout this process.
Last but not least, the People: Remote Year Denali is a group of 40 amazing individuals, lead by our fearless leader and positivity unicorn, Erica. (She’s the one wearing the grey jacket on the bottom right of me in the photo below). Everyone is so incredibly talented, driven and passionate about making the most of both their careers and life — it’s impossible to not feel inspired to do the same every single day. Back home, I’ve always felt like the odd one out at work, always questioning things and always pushing the envelope because I wanted more: I wanted more to my career than what people decided for me and I wanted more to life than what I knew. I can’t tell you how incredible it feels to meet 39 other individuals who feel EXACTLY the same way.

Lisbon is an incredible energetic place. And since I moved here, in 2016, the city has developed a lot and, fortunately, it continues to innovate.
One of the best parts of living in the capital is being able to closely follow the growth of the gastronomic scene, which is varied and full of good representative chefs.
It wasn’t an easy task, but I selected my all-time favorite restaurants, from the finest to the tradicional ones — for all tastes and budgets.
Belcanto is one of the main references in the Portuguese gastronomy — with 2 Michelin stars and in 42nd place on “The World’s 50 Best Restaurants” list. If you are looking for an unforgettable experience, this is the place.
Ofício is one of those restaurants that we want to take everyone to visit. They have a menu of sharable dishes and finger food that are absolutely delicious. My favorites: Spider Crab, Sea Vegetable Taco, Old-fashioned Oven Rice and, of course, the best dessert ever, the Cheese Tart by chef Hugo Candeias.
This Viennese coffee house makes me feel at home. They serve traditional Austrian dishes, like Wiener Schnitzel, and my favorite pastries, Apfelstrudel and the Sachertorte. On weekends, they also serve brunch.
Bairro do Avillez is divided into two main areas: Taberna (a more relaxed space, with small dishes, charcuterie and finger food) and Páteo (a sea-food restaurant organized in two floors). My favorite dish is the Flaked Cod with Cornbread and Fried Egg. For dessert, my recommendations are Bairro’s Pavlova and the Olive Oil and Honey Pudding with Lemon Zest.
Tapisco is a mix of Spanish tapas and Portuguese cuisine, with a food menu that is meant to be shared. My recommendations: Tomato Bread with Jamón Ibérico de Bellota, Salted Cod “À Brás” and the Dark Chocolate Mousse with Olive Oil and Fleur de Sel.
The first time I went to Osteria was on my first date with my boyfriend. The place is very cozy, and they serve authentic Italian food, prepared according to old family recipes. I highly recommend the Focaccia and the Pasta al Pesto di Rapa Rossa (picture above).
This is one of those restaurants that is always full of cool people. The highlight, which captures the attention of all who pass by, is the giant Instagram-famous Octopus sculpture dangling above the dining room like a nautical chandelier. The food is Peruvian inspired and the signature dish is ceviche (as the name says).
JncQUOI is located in a historic theater that was converted into a fashionable place, with a high-end men’s store, a DeliBar with gourmet store, and a restaurant. There you will find classic Portuguese and International dishes signed by Chef António Bóia and a wine selection with over 500 references that promise to offer the best wine experience in the country.
Definitely the best sushi in Lisbon. It has the coolest bar area, an elegant dining room, and a beautiful garden for the warmer nights. If you can choose, I would recommend the sushi bar area, where you can see the magic happening. I’ve tried the Tasting Menu, that includes the best selection of creative sushi, sashimi and miso ever. Not to mention the dessert selection, where sugar balance was the rule and things as lime, chocolate, pineapple and flowers were combined in perfect harmony.
Located on the riverside of Lisbon’s Belém district, overlooking the Tejo River, the SUD Terrazza restaurant is influenced by Italian and Mediterranic cuisine. I highly recommend it for a romantic dinner or a family lunch. The view is amazing!
The Oriental Market is located in front of Martim Moniz Square and have lots of different food stalls. If you like Oriental food, this is the place. I recommend the first restaurant, right at the entrance on the left, and also the Mint House, on the second floor, with the best Pad Thai in Lisbon.
It was the smell of fresh pasta (and truffle) that led me to discover this restaurant, which is close to my house and has become one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Lisbon.
The environment is extremely cozy and the pasta is delicious. I’ve returned several times and keep ordering the same dish over and over again: Tagliatelle al ragù di carne. You need to try it!

Before we get into this post, I’ll admit I didn’t travel to Lisbon solo — but it felt like I did. I took this trip with my best friend (at the time), but it may as well have been on my own due to us wanting to do different things on the trip.
I’ll get into all that later, but for now, I’m writing this from the perspective of what I would do (and most things I did) when I travel solo, even if I technically traveled with someone.
In this post, I’ll share my honest review and opinions of Lisbon, Portugal, and what it’s like for a solo female traveler. I’ll also discuss some of the best things I saw, did, and ate while there.
I’ll also be diving deep into the more personal aspects of this trip, including some of the biggest things I’ve learned from my time there and some of the best people I met who have greatly inspired me.
Before I get into the best things I did in Lisbon, I NEED to talk about where I stayed! This hostel was probably the best I’ve ever stayed at — it had everything I could have needed, wanted, and more.
I stayed at Yes! Hostel and could not have chosen a better one. The staff were super friendly, very welcoming, and organized games, nights out, and pub crawls.

If you had ever been to Lisbon, probably you know the Tagus river (Rio Tejo), and Commerce Plaza (Praça do Comércio), but what many people do not know is what we can find in the other margin of the river.
On the south shore of the Tagus river, in Almada city, but precisely in Cacilhas neighborhood, in addition to the traditional restaurants, very interesting tourist activities and the unmistakable architecture, an abandoned pier and ruinous, little-visited nowadays and commonly known as Cais do Ginjal.
I discovered this pier, by pure coincidence, one day after visiting King Christ, I noticed that a few people were exploring on foot an unpaved street that goes down towards the river, I was curious and decided to follow the path to see what was down there.
The descent is a bit steep, slippery and full of holes, the view is very interesting because above we have the King Christ and below the Tagus river and the April’s 25 bridge, there were other foreigners exploring the same path, usually equipped with fancy cameras, comfortable shoes, and lots of sunscreen on the face.
The end of the path is surprising when we come across the Tagus River bank and to the right the…

“Once you start travelling solo, you wouldn’t want to go back!”
It all began in the year 2019. My Easter Break was thoroughly planned out. I was visiting my friend in Finland, and we were going to backpack Estonia. The only problem: This trip started on Monday, and it did not feel right to waste the weekend. And that is how my first solo trip happened.
I chose to go to Lisbon for I heard a lot about it, as well as its proximity to Madrid. I took an overnight bus, spent 16 hours in the city and came back by another overnight bus, thus saving me time and money. I had pre-marked a few things I wanted to experience, like a ride on Tram 29 and visit Belem for sunset. As soon as I reached Lisbon at dusk, I was welcomed by a grey sky and drenched streets. However, it was my first solo trip, and I was too pumped up to let this deter me. So, I proceeded towards my first destination, the Santa-Justa funicular(lift). Most cities in Europe offer a one-day public transport pass and, I could use the same pass for the Funicular. The Santa-Justa funicular, standing at the height of 15 floors, was at the centre of the city. It offered splendid panoramic views of this beautiful city.
Right next to the Funicular was the ruins of the Igreja De Carmo, an ancient church that could not survive the Portuguese war. These ruins reminded me of the fact that chaos can be beautiful. After spending some time there, I proceeded towards the centre of Lisbon- The Sao Nicolau. It was an ancient marketplace, now a wide-open space with the view of the church of Sao Nicolau. Walking through the streets around looking at the Portuguese architecture was an out-of-the-world experience. I stopped for a “Uma Bica”- the Portuguese coffee at one of the numerous cafes in the centre; this was not a typical espresso. The Portuguese roasting process is a bit different, giving the coffee a smoother texture.
Lisbon was one of the reasons I developed an interest in viewpoints. This city had so many of those that made it possible to get amazing views from different angles. Alfama was the second viewpoint, Santa Justa being the first one. Alfama was a little trek towards the top of the park, giving visibility of amazing landscape like the hanging houses. After sinking in the exhilarating beauty, I decided to board the Tram 29. Out of sheer luck on timing, this otherwise bustling tram station was empty. I hopped on the tram, and it took me around the city of Lisbon, and it was magnificent. Dense Portuguese architecture and the grey weather gave me the eighteenth century feels that I only felt from History textbooks. Tram 29 took me around the city, covering all landmarks, while I stood at the rear, looking through the glass with awe for an hour.
It was late afternoon when Tram 29 brought me back to the centre. I walked around the neighbourhood of Sacramento, exploring neighbourhoods, admiring the street art and local markets. By the time I covered quite aground, I had grown hungry. I was in the vicinity of Santa Catarina with no cafes nearby, except this small restaurant that had no customers. Finding vegetarian food initially in Europe was a problem. I went in hoping to find some food, and the kind chef inside asked me what I wanted. I told him that I was hungry and wanted vegetarian food. The guy’s exact words were “We are closed right now, but its difficult to find vegetarian food around. We don’t have it in our menu either but Ill whip up something for you”. And he did. He made me a special vegetarian platter. My experience with Portuguese was outstanding since the beginning of the day, but this incident took my heart away.
After a hearty lunch, I walked towards Belem. Belem had a great beach, yacht-dock with impressive views and a cultural centre. I walked into the cultural centre, saw some exhibits, and learnt some cool titbits on Portuguese culture and history. After an hour in the museum, I walked outside, along the coast towards the monument of discoveries. That was an immense marble wonder, standing on the banks of Tagus river, dedicated to the wanderer and discoverer, Enrique. By this time, the weather was quite good, and the atmosphere was upbeat. I took a seat and napped of for an hour. Fifteen kilometres of city-walking was a tiresome feat.
As soon as I got up, it was sunset time. And Portugal, the Westernmost country of Europe, offered fantastic sunset views. So, I went to the best sunset point of the city, and the third viewpoint, the Jardim Sao Pedro de Alcantara, a cheery cliffside. For a moment, I paused and reflected what a beautiful sight this was. Orange sky, scents of spring, calm guitar music and cocktails to melt for, it was a perfect conclusion to my first solo trip.
It was a bit scary and took a lot of planning. It was also a test for my confidence and a dip in my savings. But it was totally worth it. For otherwise, I would not have discovered the joy of being called a solo traveller. — I left a piece of my heart in Portugal.

The first day that I mostly recovered from jet-lag was the Sunday after I got in. I woke up around 11 and then just went for a walk.
I knew before I came here that my apartment would be decently small, but I hope that I won’t be spending too much time in it. A large motivation for coming to Lisbon was that I have a walk-able city with lots of spaces that I can work in. The only real part of my trip planning was scouting out some coworking spaces that might be good to integrate into my routine.
A little before Covid I heard about WeWork, their wacky CEO, and the company’s seemingly impending collapse. Before Covid I didn’t understand why anyone would pay someone money just to rent a desk or a conference room for an afternoon. If you don’t have to be in a specific office why wouldn’t you just work from your own place or a cafe or something?
BUT… now I’m a fully remote worker and never have any real interest in going into the office (hardly anyone on my team even lives in Atlanta even if I did go in). I find it hard to focus in an office setting. I’ve realized that I’m part of a weirdly new cohort of workers that have only had full-time work during/after Covid, and by extension during/after the normalization of remote work. I feel awkward going into the office for my work now. In part just because software engineering falls into the category of “deep work”. Most of the time a super productive software engineering day is when you have no meetings and can just keep your nose to the grindstone for as long as possible and hardly come up for air until you’re exhausted. This is how I usually worked on all my computer science classes in school.
Now when I rarely have gone into the office (probably less than 10 times total) I feel like an added layer of subconscious pressure to not only be productive, but also to LOOK productive and conform to arbitrary office culture quirks.
Do I look like I’m on my phone too much? How many times can I get up for the bathroom before people think I’m slacking off? If I were at home I’d take a shower and a nap and come back more productive right now. When can I leave for lunch without it being weird? How long can I actually take for lunch? Is it weird to have a YouTube podcast up while I work? Why can’t I wear shorts? The women in the office can wear skirts? Is it weird to be the only person in this quiet room on a call? Should I move into another room for this even if it’s just a few minutes?
Sure, most of these concerns are in my head and would likely evaporate after more than a handful of days in an office setting, but they NEVER come up when I’m working remote. I can just worry about the work. And I like that. The work is stimulating and enjoyable, and I don’t think I need much more than that out of my work.
The only thing I get out of an office setting is seeing people that I kind of know (not even on my team) walking through the room and the occasional two seconds of “water cooler talk” before trying to lock back in for 4–6 hours of straight programming.
Anyways … I say that all to say that I don’t really enjoy going into an office. But really a lot of my objection is going into MY office.
Coworking spaces seem to weirdly solve a lot of my general office anxieties. If these people in the room have no impact on my career why should I care at all what they think of the way that I work? The only exception is maybe for being on a call in a shared space, but usually there’s a clear separation of:
Before coming to Lisbon I researched a few coworking space options, in anticipation of my apartment being small enough to make me feel cooped up. Also, having a monthly membership that I’m paying for creates an incentive to actually leave my apartment everyday and walk around, which is half the reason that I came to Lisbon. It’s like having one of those alarm clocks that shreds money after enough snooze time.
On Sunday I woke up late and just walked around down into Lisbon.
I’ve spent the last few months looking at neighborhoods on maps, but wanted to actually see them in person and then decide where I’d like to spend more time. I also wanted to verify all the generalizations that I’d heard about several neighborhoods through loose internet content.
There’s a main metro line that runs from my apartment, through the city, and down to the water. I spent my walk going along the path of the metro line, which also let me go by the two coworking space candidates that I’ve narrowed down to (Second Home Lisbon and Heden Rossio).
Before I came to Lisbon and I was looking at the city on the map I think I subconsciously assumed that only some parts of the city were actually lively. Lisbon has almost exactly the same population as Atlanta, but I feel like I only ever saw large groups of people in Atlanta on campus, the interstate, and in a few popular dense areas. Parts of midtown, EAV, the mall, the battery, & the Beltline, these are always busy, but they’re pockets of the city that are dramatically spread out. I think subconsciously I assumed there would be a similar effect in Lisbon, but I was a little surprised while I was walking around that most places have lots of people all the time. At most there will be a pockets of a few blocks that are quiet, but the busier streets and squares are connected in a way that you’re never in a “dead spot”. I feel like Atlanta (as well as most American cities) are mostly “dead spots” with businesses sprinkled in between.
After my weekend walk I spent the first few weekdays sleeping in late and then working from my apartment. My girlfriend Lauren arrived for a week starting that Wednesday. We went to Paris to visit two of my friends for the weekend, but I’ll write about that in my next post. That threw off settling into my schedule a little, but it was nice to have someone I know here with me for the first few days.
Now that I’ve had a few days to sort-of adjust my sleep schedule and have a few normal work days, here is what I hope my daily routine will look like:
That’s what I HOPE my daily schedule will look like. Get some nice outside time while it’s still sunny. Maybe get to enjoy the city for a little before the sun sets before I’m out of work. What more could you ask for!?
But I’m afraid that most likely what will happen is I’ll have slow mornings and just start working from my apartment, feeling like I’ll waste time commuting to another location. And then I’ll barely leave my apartment except to occasionally eat.
Am I scared of this because It’s exactly what happened the first week and the last few days?
… maybe …
There is still plenty of time for correction. This will be my first full uninterrupted week, so I’m hoping that will let me get into a good rhythm.
In general I think my time here can only go one of two ways.
It should be easy for the whole three months to be great. Get outside and walk around a lot more, eat good food, enjoy nice warm-but-not-hot weather, and pick up some Portuguese. There’s not really much more to say here.
Before I came to PT I knew there was a non-negligible chance that it could get unpleasant by the end. My sleep schedule might not ever be great, I might get bogged down in work, might not make any friends or have much interaction with native English speakers for a LONG time (arguably this could be more socially “isolated” than I ever was during Covid where at least I was living with family or roommates).
I’m being a little dramatic. The most likely outcome is probably somewhere smack in the middle. But it’s still frightening to be right at the gate of three potentially very unpleasant months. I decided before I booked any plans that, at the end of the day, it’s ONLY three potentially unpleasant months.
I feel like I can probably tolerate almost anything for three months.
My walk on Sunday ended when I reached the ocean. Really they call it a river, but it’s more of a river-fed bay + peninsula situation similar to San Francisco. Hilariously there is also a bridge nearly identical to the Golden Gate.
AND they even have cable cars up the steeper hills like in San Francisco too!
I landed at a little square on the water with some tables and a little drink/snack “quiosque” (kiosk), there’s lots of those here.
There was a live band setup in a circle playing Samba music. I knew they were serious when I heard one of them playing a flute, hardly any casual bands have flutes.
Here’s a short video I took of them when I sat down for a second.
I LOVE Samba and Bossa Nova. Here is one of my favorite songs.
A large reason why I came to Portugal is because I listen to so much Brazilian music and want to be more proficient with the language. I realized while I was listening to the band that this is the first time that I’ve ever had the chance to hear music like this performed live. In my mind this kind of music is only still actively performed in Brazil, so I was a little shocked to just stumble upon a live performance on my first outing in Lisbon. I came to Portugal instead of Brazil because they speak a lot more English here and I figured Europe would be less of a culture shock, but also less of the music that I love.
We all have far more music now than ever before. Not just more access to music, but A LOT MORE being made (thanks internet). The tradeoff is that a lot less music is performed live, and what is still live is usually only small bands. I don’t that’s all bad, but it is unfortunate.
A lot of my favorite tracks are from large bands (here’s another favorite of mine and another with big bands). A lot of the complexity of Samba + Bossa Nova really comes through when you have the organized chaos of lots of really different instruments playing unusual rhythms all at once.
I love this music so much that I traveled to another country in large part to attempt to learn the language it’s performed in. And I just happened to stumble onto some of it on what I thought was the wrong side of the ocean.
Later I walked by again and a big crowd had gathered and people were starting to dance.
The band was amazingly proficient. They play in that square every weekend with a rotating cast of performers.
I sat, and listened, and teared up for a second.
I’m really lucky.
I think this trip will go well.

While planning our summer vacation, I had the idea of driving from Lisbon to Amsterdam to visit friends and camp along the way. Mina, my wife, was traveling for work at the time, and when I shared the plan with her, she was excited about the adventure. We envisioned exploring more cities, enjoying the freedom to travel on our own schedule, and potentially saving some money.
I used Google Sheets to estimate costs, plan routes, and find camping spots. A month later, we set off on our three-week road trip!
In this article, I’ll share our experience — detailing our road trip and camping adventures, along with the costs involved. I’ll also provide insights into the data we collected during the trip. If you’re considering a road trip and camping in Europe, this guide will help you make informed decisions with less stress.
I started by examining the direct route from Lisbon to Amsterdam and zoomed in to identify potential cities where we could stop and camp. Our journey would take us through Spain, France, and Belgium before reaching the Netherlands. I wanted us to visit several cities but also to experience them at a relaxed pace, so I aimed to limit our driving to no more than five hours a day. Although the shortest route would have taken us through Paris — a city we’ve already…

Living Like A Local In Lisbon, Portugal — a city of cobbled roads and colourful tram rides.
A place of allure with its unique charm, symmetrically laid Portuguese pavements, brightly painted buildings and viewpoints that reveal layers of terracotta rooftops intermixed with tall church steeples, you can lose your heart to this European city that effortlessly blends traditional heritage with modern design and progressive thinking.
Portugal’s hilly, coastal capital city sits on the Tagus River with the Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge linking its banks. Its beauty takes on all shades of wonder, intrigue, architecture and history and it is famed for its many viewpoints, the most impressive being from São Jorge Castle.
Long-drawn to see the city, I recently bought an air ticket, booked an apartment and spent a month living like a local in the historic Alfama district, and once familiar, in more residential Santos. Arriving with no plans other than to immerse myself into the local living, that is exactly what I did.
Among the attractions discovered were the National Azulejo Museum displaying five centuries of decorative ceramic tiles. In trendy Belem, the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology (MAAT) is where these three areas intertwine within a space of debate and dialogue. I took time to listen to Fado music and learn more about its origins, visited the Museu do Aljube that showcases Portugal under dictatorship and the country’s subsequent struggle for freedom and democracy, spent time in the impressive Maritime Museum and lingered in art galleries.
From the imposing São Jorge Castle — which is worth walking up to — the view encompasses the old city’s pastel-coloured buildings and Tagus Estuary. Be sure to take a trip across the river to see the Cristo Rei statue — you’d be forgiven for thinking you were in Rio — as well as a closer look at residential Almada.
Just outside Lisbon you’ll find a string of Atlantic beaches, from Cascais to Estoril and further inland the charming royal sanctuary resort town on the foothills of Portugal’s Sintra Mountains, Sintra.
I spent much time at the LX Factory, a regenerated creative island that is home to fashion, food, fine arts, music, and one of the best bookshops I’ve ever seen. I walked for hours to familiarise myself with the lay of the land seeking out the best examples of Calçada Portuguesa pavements and photographing street art. I lingered in restaurants and cafes, shopped at local markets and ate more pasteis de nata than I care to admit to.
Views across the city from the top of Elevador de Santa Justa in the heart of the city are unbeatable. On the popular Praça do Comércio you’ll find the iconic Rua Augusta Arch, a historical building and visitor attraction built to commemorate the city’s reconstruction after the 1755 earthquake. Built to resemble the shape of a caravel, the massive, the angular Monument to the Discoveries is a prominent feature of the Belem waterfront well worth seeing.
I’m already planning my return trip for more, and could quite easily join the half a million lucky ones who get to call Lisboa home. This is a city to live in, no matter the length of your stay, make it your home for those days and pretend you’re a local soaking up the old-fashioned laidback of this inviting European city.
Getting there: There may not be direct flights to Lisbon from South Africa, but that shouldn’t deter as many European airlines service the Lisbon Airport, and you can get there from Cape Town or Johannesburg with just one connection. Alternately, the very affordable TAAG Angola Airlines offers easy access via Luanda.
Visas: South African passport holders require a Schengen Visa to visit Portugal.
Accommodation: A wide variety of accommodation options exist, be it for a luxury hotel, or Airbnb apartment. The best areas to base yourself are historic Alfama, Rossio in the heart of the city, Baixa for shopping and the charming Bairro Alto.
Don’t miss: Arguably the best pastéis de nata in the city can be found at the small bustling Manteigaria, Time Out Market Lisboa.

Who would have known that Portuguese waiters are so smart? They know how to trick tourists into spending more money. Oh Lord, they know how to do it well too!
A few weeks ago, I visited Lisbon. Lovely city.
Everybody speaks a pretty good level of English, so it’s very easy to communicate when you find yourself lost over the shore, or somewhere between the tiny bohemian uphill streets, or in the subway, or even between shelves of a 24hr grocery store. Yes, I have a terrible sense of direction. And yes, I get lost a lot.
Lisbonian people are not extremely nice or talkative like Spaniards, but they will answer calmly every stupid-sounding question you may have about the dish you are just about to order. They will politely, but with no smile on their face, explain what type of ticket you should or should not buy to get to a certain area of the city. At some point I felt as if I were in Spain, but instead of Spaniards, everyone was German.
I figured they are just different. Would saying they are more civilised offend my Spanish friends? If so, then forget it. Let’s say they are just more quiet and ‘minding their own business’ all the time.
But when it comes to ripping off tourists, they are masters. They have mastered the art so well; even I got tricked.
Because you know, I don’t travel like a run-of-the mill tourist. You knew it right?? RIGHT?? A real fan of The Tripventurist should be aware of that! Anywho, I hope I’ve made myself clear.
I can’t even remember the last time I was ripped-off. I generally keep my eyes wide open, my money deep down in my pocket, and pay only fair prices while traveling. But somehow I let my guard down just for a second and bam-smash, 10 extra euros added to a 12 euros bill. Almost double what I was going to pay in the first place.
You wanna know why, how and where?
My lovely workmate Nazaret and I were wandering through the teeny-tiny streets of Lisbon on a Monday night after a long day mastering our networking skills at a business conference.
We were trying to find a decent restaurant. Please note, we were starving to death and every place we found was touristy looking and run by Turkish men (who we wouldn’t trust preparing our food). Or pizza places.
Nazaret kept refusing the first ones, and I would keep saying NO to pizza places.
We got ourselves into a tie.
At one point I briefly thought about checking trashcans for leftovers but I zipped my lip, didn’t share the idea with Nazaret, and kept walking.
It was a daunting task I must say, but we were still trying hard to keep our spirits up while faking smiles.
And then, out of the blue, a tiny restaurant appeared on the corner of the street. It was a sign from heaven.
You can’t even imagine how excited we got. Even though we kept our cool while entering the place, I knew Nazaret wanted to hug me. And I wanted to hug her too. That’s how happy we were about finding a quiet, tasty-looking place and finally being fed.
A nice chatty elderly waitress approached our little table and brought us a plate full of tiny round cheeses. By the labels, we learned that these were local goat, sheep and cow cheeses. A kind of delicatessen you might say. We were positively surprised by their hospitality and the fact that they were promoting local products by offering them as a free appetizer, before we’d even started looking at the menu.
I am not a cheese person but my not fed for 12 hours body gobbled half of the dish immediately. And Nazaret stuffed her face with the remaining half.
A bit happier, we both ordered soup as a first course and decided to split a second course: fried fish with a huge salad and boiled potatoes. No dessert. We were happily full once we’d finished the second course and the Portuguese white wine.
Since the place was so small, we got into a conversation with the guys dining next to us. Entrepreneurs from Italy, based in Berlin, surf addicted — funny and cute.
Nice evening.
Until we were handed the bill.
According to the prices we saw on the menu, our bill was supposed to be around 12 euros. But magically it had been almost duplicated.
We were being charged almost 10 euros for the free treat of cheeses.
Well, it was not a treat anymore. Now it was a rip-off.
Our jaws dropped at the same time. We had been tricked into paying 10 euros for something we hadn’t ordered in the first place. What’s more, I am sure it would probably have cost us less than 4 euros in the closest grocery store.
It was a well-paid lesson on local customs, I must say.
At first, we thought it was a “dick move” toward tourists. And we furiously shared the story with every single person we met the next day — all of them foreigners attending a business conference like us. Until one of the local entrepreneur explained that this is how things work in Portugal.
Apparently, every single appetizer served the moment you’re sitting your ass on a chair in a restaurant, will always be charged (a large amount of money).
My Poland-born, Spain-raised mind can’t understand that. I mean why? Why on Earth?
We were instructed by the local entrepreneur that you won’t be charged for appetizers unless you touch them.
So guys, if you are in Portugal and a big bottle of Moet champagne lands on your table, do not touch it unless you want an additional 200 euros on your 20 euros dinner bill.
And during the next 3 days, we mastered the skill of screaming “NO NO NO NO NO!!” to every single waitress approaching us with a plate of cheese or olives, or bread sticks.
Thanks for the lesson in assertiveness, Lisbon!

“When friends come to visit our family in Lisbon, they always say that they don’t want us to make a big fuss. “We don’t need to do anything special. We just want to see you.” On the surface this is an endearing and considerate sentiment. It’s also code for, “let’s not go out for every meal.” At first, this is a relief. Dragging (in this case 10 total) people around the city for every meal is a daunting endeavor.”
Why Restaurants Cringe at ""Party of 10"" During Rush Hour:
Imagine the scene: it’s 7 p.m. on a Friday night, the dining room is buzzing with chatter, servers are weaving through tables with plates stacked high, and the kitchen is a symphony of sizzling pans and shouted orders.
•	Then, the phone rings—or worse, a group strolls in unannounced—and the host hears those dreaded words: ""Party of 10.""
•	During rush hour, a large party can send a ripple of unease through even the most seasoned restaurant staff.
•	While customers might see it as just a fun night out, for the restaurant, it’s a logistical puzzle that threatens to disrupt the delicate balance of service, space, and sanity. So why exactly do restaurants cringe when they hear ""party of 10"" during their busiest hours?
1.	There’s the issue of space. Most restaurants are designed to maximize seating efficiency, with tables arranged to accommodate couples, families of four, or small groups.
a.	A party of 10 often requires pushing tables together or commandeering a section of the dining room, which can throw off the floor plan.
b.	During rush hour, when every seat is precious, this reconfiguration might mean turning away smaller, quicker-turnover parties.
c.	A group of two can be seated, served, and out the door in an hour, while a party of 10 might linger for two or more, tying up valuable real estate. In a business where profit margins are notoriously thin—often hovering around 3-5%—losing that turnover can sting.
2.	Then there’s the strain on the staff. A party of 10 isn’t just one table; it’s a mini-event. Servers must coordinate multiple orders, ensuring drinks, appetizers, and entrees arrive in sync, all while juggling their other tables.
a.	In the kitchen, a sudden influx of 10 orders hitting the line at once can bottleneck the flow, especially if the group’s requests include substitutions, split checks, or special dietary needs.
b.	Rush hour is already a high-wire act for cooks and servers; a large party can feel like someone tossing an extra ball into the juggling routine.
c.	Mistakes pile up, tempers flare, and the domino effect can leave other diners waiting longer, their Yelp reviews growing sharper by the minute.
3.	Timing is another culprit. Large groups often move at a different pace than the restaurant’s rhythm.
a.	While smaller tables align with the quick, steady cadence of rush hour—order, eat, pay, leave—a party of 10 might dawdle over drinks, debate entrees, or wait for stragglers to arrive. This unpredictability clashes with the precision restaurants rely on during peak times.
b.	A table that’s out of sync can disrupt reservations, extend wait times, and leave the host scrambling to explain why the next party’s table isn’t ready.
c.	It’s not just about serving food; it’s about keeping the machine running smoothly, and a big group can throw a wrench into the gears.
d.	There’s the unspoken pressure of expectations. Large parties often arrive with a festive mindset—birthdays, reunions, celebrations—expecting the restaurant to match their energy with flawless service and Instagram-worthy presentation.
e.	But during rush hour, staff are stretched thin, and that extra attention can feel like a tall order. A single misstep—a forgotten side dish, a delayed refill—can sour the mood of 10 people at once, amplifying the fallout.
f.	One unhappy diner might grumble quietly; 10 unhappy diners can turn a table into a chorus of complaints, complete with a generous tip deduction.
4.	Restaurants don’t hate large parties outright. Many welcome them during slower hours, when staff can lavish attention and kitchens can flex their creativity.
a.	But during rush hour, ""party of 10"" isn’t just a reservation—it’s a test of endurance. It’s a high-stakes gamble that the team can pull off without sacrificing the experience of every other guest in the room.
b.	So the next time you call for a big table at peak time, spare a thought for the host’s tight smile or the server’s quick glance at the clock. They’re not ungrateful for your business—they’re just bracing for the storm.
It’s not the size of the party that’s the problem—it’s the timing. With a little consideration, even a party of 10 can be a welcome guest instead of a rush-hour nightmare. (Grok & DeepSeek AI)

December 2023
The children and I have developed an annual holiday excursion tradition. Tampa, San Diego, a nice Air BNB out in sticks in Maryland, then Cabo, and now Portugal.
We arrived in Lisbon in the early morning on Christmas Day. After a short Uber ride to the very nice Intercontinental Hotel, having flown overnight with little to no sleep, we got some rest. My oldest and I explored the area as her younger siblings remained asleep. Despite the lack of help from our concierge, we discovered a humongous holiday festival across the street from our hotel. It was lovely. Probably more than 10,000 people visiting the numerous food and trinket vending stations, skating, children's rides, a big Ferris Wheel and gigantic Christmas Tree.
Lisbon is a vibrant, very diverse city of nearly 600,000 residents and a metro area of 3 million people. Add to that an inexpensive city with fabulous wine and food, whose people seem to all also speak English, a short seven-hour flight from New York, and it all makes for an attractive option for retirement locations.
Our first full day was an hour’s long walk through several neighborhoods to get a feel and view of the city and eventually to Jardim Zoological (Zoo Gardens). The large animal park was far more impressive than what appeared on the outside, which would become a common theme.
Having had just an okay meal for Christmas dinner, we decided to eat at our hotel restaurant, Akra, a fine dining establishment that did not disappoint.
Day three took us to more traditional tourist attractions. The iconic Belem Tower, built 500 years ago in gothic style as a small military fort, it is still gleaming white on the banks of the Tagus River. Then a brisk walk in the cold to the Belem Cultural Center and Museum of Contemporary Art. Like nearly every activity in Portugal this trip, the art museum was far larger and better than expected.
A few blocks away was the Jeronimos Monastery, the imposing structure so beautiful the crowds it drew on this cold day to tour the inside made the queue (line) so long we decided just to take a few pics outside.
Taking advantage of how much my children were into the learning and culture, we kept it going with a visit to the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology (MAAT) — a massive two-in-one museum that combined more art, a huge exhibit on the coal burning factory the building used to be, and a well-done display on the evolution of climate change. Then to the second building featured an incredible art installation of the work of Joana Vasconcelos.
We capped the day with a visit to the Lisboa Time Out Market, the lively, packed-to-the-brim food and wine mart with scrumptious options for everyone.
The original plan for the next day was a train ride to Sintra, but a late start changed things up. We’d keep the museum vibe going with an interesting ride to the National Tile Museum.
Despite being a first-class city, Lisbon is still the capital of a second-world country and just beyond the splendor of the many tourist attractions of hundreds of years old limestone construction, there are working-class communities, grit, and a ton of graffiti. It all actually brings more appeal to Lisbon.
The National Tile Museum epitomized our more than we expected Portugal experience. The museum is deceptively large, with several floors of exhibits. Extremely impressive craftsmanship dating back more than 500 years. Art including many hundreds of individual tiles that depict Biblical scenes or provincial gardens. There were also more modern tiles with colorful artistic designs. One of the most impressive pieces was a nearly three hundred-year-old tile installation that takes up two large walls displaying the Lisbon shoreline and surrounding neighborhoods with such detail it could be used as a map.
The tile museum is connected to an old Catholic church built in the 1500’s, fully intact and open to visitors. The ostentatious sanctuary is similar to those built throughout Europe during that age.
After several hours of viewing beautiful tiles, we traveled to the chic LX Factory for shopping and dinner. Then another Uber back to the hotel. Uber has figured something out in Lisbon. No matter where we were, tourist district or further out, of the ten Ubers we took on this trip, not one of them had more than a 3-minute wait and most were 1–2 minutes.
Our delayed day trip to the nearby town of Sintra did not disappoint. Worried the crowds would swell on the weekend, we were still able to avoid most of the long queues to see the amazing castles and palaces from what was the first center of European Romantic architecture in the 19th century.
There is the Moorish castle that can be seen from anywhere in Sintra, the vibrant colored Pena Palace, several ornate chalets, plus gorgeous beaches on the other side of the city.
We took it all in while riding in sleek, self-guided, two-person vehicles we rented.
We returned the cars a few minutes past our five-hour allocated time, especially after a few wrong turns that I made trying to make sense of the GPS directions on the foreign, winding, thin streets.
The train ride into Sintra gave us a glimpse, but the nighttime train ride back to Lisbon was even more revealing. The suburbs between Lisbon and Sintra are full with Cape Verdeans. Like other European cities, and the converse to what America did with White flight in the 50s and 60s, poor immigrants of color are housed on the outskirts of the major cities, tucked away in very large apartment complexes that we’d call projects in the States.
Cape Verde is a small island nation off the west coast of Africa that was colonized by Portugal. Cape Verde’s government says that 300,000 of its countrymen now call Portugal home. While the vast majority of Black people in the Lisbon region are Cape Verdean, there are also people from a few other African countries Portugal colonized, like Mozambique and Angola. And there is a growing population of American expats of all races.
Our last day was relaxed and mostly unstructured. After our daily hotel breakfast buffet that was included with our rooms, we all went back to sleep briefly. Then a short Uber ride to the Praça do Comércio Square, the largest and most popular square in Lisbon and a major tourist attraction.
Then we basically shopped till we dropped. A few hours of perusing and occasionally buying at the continuous string of shops along the route to Santa Justa Lift then more shopping at an adjacent district up the hill to the Bairro Alto neighborhood, known for its saturation of bars, clubs, and restaurants. A delicious Mediterranean dinner that was yet another high quality, high quantity, very inexpensive meal. We walked it off with an evening stroll back to the hotel. The girls would later head back to Bairro Alto to hang out at a few of the pubs we had walked past. Their very late night almost caused them to miss our morning flight. But we all made it.
An amazing week in Portugal. Even better than expected!

…en a choice, I would any day pick either Braga or Porto over Lisbon and skip the latter altogether. The capital of Portugal is a beautiful city, no doubt, but it is also predictably touristy and, as such, immensely avoidable after a mandatory trip, or two. Having said that, it doesn’t alwa…

2021 was an unbelievably surprising year! At least for me. One of the biggest surprises of this year was discovering the Digital Nomad lifestyle and learning more about it.
I had an opportunity to work remotely from June this year. I was like, alright, it’s time to get creative now and explore something new! Awesome, right?!
After thinking for like 5 minutes, I decided to spend a couple of months in Lisbon and work from there. Because, why not? I mean, the food is good, they have a great culture, and the people are awesome. Deal!
To give you more clarity, I’m Content Creator. I love exploring new places that inspire me to generate new ideas. I never miss a chance to meet new people or learn about new things.
So I just bought a one-way ticket from Tallinn(that’s where I’m based generally) to Lisbon and decided to see how my life would go.
What a fantastic decision! I loved every second of my experience there. I met soo many incredible people and learned more about…

Portugal is a small but mighty country, offering varied landscapes and idyllic scenery at every turn, as you can hop from a medieval castle to a golden beach to a bustling city in less than a day. Whether your priority is food, relaxation, nightlife, or history, you can satiate all of these interests (and more) in Portugal. While I would have loved to spend weeks here, our eight day trip to Porto and Lisbon (with a day trip to Sintra) was wildly fulfilling. We’re already dreaming about our next visit, this time to the southern tip of the country, along the beaches of Faro and Albufeira…
Porto is windy and whimsical, filled to the brim with delicious (and gloriously cheap) wine, sumptuous food, sweeping views, and loads of charm. Porto certainly has “attractions,” but the best way to experience the city is by simply wandering at a leisurely pace, drinking wine on the riverfront, snacking on petiscos, riding the tram and hopping off whenever you feel inspired, and endlessly pursuing a new vantage point over the city. We spent three nights in this hilly city and could have easily spent a handful more. We’ll certainly be back.
We flew into Lisbon’s airport and immediately went to the Santa Apolonia train station to catch a train to Porto (to the Porto Campanha station). Trains run pretty frequently throughout the day and don’t need to be purchased in advance (we bought ours literally seven minutes before the train departed). Though it made for a long travel day, we decided to head to Porto first thing so that we didn’t have to worry about taking an aggressively early train back to Lisbon for our morning flight on our last day.
We stayed at this delightful Airbnb on a charming car-free street in the heart of the city, filled at all times of day with revelers, street musicians, and wandering pedestrians (it can certainly get noisy, but as New Yorkers, we were completely unfazed). As we worked remotely for half of our time in Porto, we loved the sun exposure and fantastic light — it was also lovely to be able to open the French doors and get fresh air. If there’s a better Porto apartment out there, I’d like to see it.
Dom Luis Bridge: This bridge is in the foreground of all the most iconic images of Porto, and for good reason. The bridge should be explored and admired both down by the water (the Ribeira) and by walking across (ideally the top level, which you can reach by hiking up to the Cathedral — the entrance to the bridge is right next to it). The top level of the bridge can get extremely windy and a bit vertigo-inducing (it’s really high!) but man, the views are epic. It’s a short walk across the bridge but will probably take at least 20 minutes, since you’ll be stopping to take pictures every two seconds. After you cross, you’ll end up in the town of Vila Nova de Gaia, where you can stroll along the waterfront looking back over to Porto (this is also where all of the port houses are located).
Port Tour: Whatever your feelings about port might be (mine are admittedly rather lukewarm), you can’t visit Porto without booking a port tour. While there are several satisfaction-guaranteed options, we decided to book a tour at Graham’s based on a friend’s recommendation. The grounds are immaculate, the view of the city is beautiful, and the tour is engaging and informative. We each sampled four different ports, and while I still can’t say it’s something I will actively seek out, I now certainly appreciate the nuances in the different categories of port, and the precise way in which they’re all made.
Porto Cathedral: The best part of the cathedral is the view of Porto, as it’s perched high above the city (and requires a fairly steep climb). I found the interior of the cathedral to be a bit unimpressive, and instead appreciated the imposing exterior and the views over Porto’s terra cotta rooftops.
Clérigos Tower: This baroque, slightly odd-looking clock tower is the tallest in Portugal, and affords stunning 360 views of the entire city. Definitely worth the price of admission.
Foz do Douro: Take the old-school tram (eléctrico) from Infante (water-front Ribeira area) to Passeio Alegre. You’ll feel like you’re in another world all together; in just 20 minutes you’re transported from the city to the beautiful beachy waterfront. Walk out to the Felgueiras lighthouse, situated at the edge of the Douro River and the Atlantic coastline of Foz do Douro, for some epic waves crashing against the pier (but seriously, be careful — the waves can take you with them). If you have time, continue your seashore walk up to Matosinhos, where you can grab an ice cream at Bar Titã. Matosinhos is also home to some great fish and seafood restaurants (as one would expect), especially at Rua Heróis de França, where you can find the cooks grilling the fish outside.
Armazem: If you have only a day or two in Porto, you can skip this, but if you’re in Porto for 3+ days, an antiques fiend, and/or missing Brooklyn, I’d add this to your list. It’s basically a massive antiques shop in a warehouse, complete with a hip(ster) bar (both indoors and outdoors). You can definitely do some fun (read: tipsy) shopping here.
Taberna dos Mercadores: Stop what you’re doing and make a reservation at this place. No, you can’t make a reservation online, but get over it and call this number immediately: +351 22 201 0510. It will be the best meal of your trip. Order the clams a bulhao pato and (this is absolutely essential) the arroz com polvo. You will never have experienced anything like it and might never again.
Casa Guedes: Check out this small little shop for a pulled pork sandwich that will blow your mind. Don’t be alarmed if there’s a long line (it’s worth the wait, and it doesn’t take too long.) Ask for the Sande de Pernil com Queijo. If you really want to live like a local, order a glass of Tinto Bruto (a sparkling red wine) to accompany your sandwich.
Brasao Cervejaria: You can’t leave Porto without trying the Francesinha, an insane croque madame-like concoction that’s made with thick bread, Portuguese sausage and steak, then covered in cheese and drowned in a special tomato and beer sauce. Nearly every eating establishment in Porto will proclaim they have the best (and you can wait in line for an hour at Cafe Santiago with other tourists for “the best”), but our friend who lives in Porto recommended this joint (which takes reservations and involves no wait), and I can’t really imagine it being better. Protip: order the half size. You absolutely do not need a full serving.
Maioral: If you are itching for a true local experience devoid of tourists, head up to Maioral, a nondescript little place right by the water, a 20 minute drive north of downtown. Our friend (who lives in Porto) took us here for an authentic Portuguese experience, full of the freshest fish and the cheapest (but most delicious) wine.
O Paparico: If you’re looking for a fine dining experience or a special occasion meal, O Paparico has you covered. It’s a bit out of the way (about a 15-minute cab ride north of town) and quite pricey, but it’s a worthy splurge. It’s romantically rustic and feels upscale (read: white linen) yet totally unpretentious. The service is impeccable, and each dish of the tasting menu is carefully arranged to give you a taste of traditional Portuguese cuisine, but with an inventive twist. After the meal, I echoed the surprise of many other reviewers who are baffled by the fact that it lacks a Michelin star (only four Porto restaurants hold this honor). It seems poised to earn this distinction in the near future.
Bacalhau: Nothing life-changing, but immediately after arriving in Porto we sat on the riverfront and enjoyed a fantastic meat & cheese plate and glasses of crisp white Porto wines. We also sampled their namesake (the bacalhau), which was tasty but nothing to write home about. Overall though, we were more than happy with the outcome.
Base: This is an awesome outdoor bar (and café) right at the base of Clérigos Tower. We grabbed a couple of espressos and enjoyed their bangin’ playlist (I Shazam-ed nearly every song).
Wine Quay Bar: Cozy, intimate little wine bar situated overlooking the Douro River. The wine selection is extensive and on point, rivaled only by the views.
For a bit more of a scene, check out Bonaparte Downtown. It’s not necessarily anything special, but our local friend from Porto brought us here and we enjoyed the low-key Irish pub vibes.
If we’d had more time in Porto, there’s no doubt we would have booked a cruise down the Douro Valley and visited some wineries. It’s stunningly beautiful, and I’d highly recommend looking into a day trip. This cruise was recommended to us by our friend who lives in Porto.
Lisbon is Europe’s capital of cool, and it’s certainly trying pretty hard. Where Porto is quaint and understated, Lisbon is sprawling and occasionally flashy. The tourist crowds are mostly unobtrusive in Porto, whereas in Lisbon they are swarming and unavoidable. And, the food in Porto simply is better (many a Lisbon native will attest to this). However, Lisbon saddles up right next to its rival by boasting stunning panoramas (reached but punishing yet ultimately rewarding hills), a unique blend of charm and grittiness (cobblestone alleyways juxtaposed against graffiti-saturated walls), an impressive foodie scene (led fearlessly by national treasure Jose Avillez), and breathtaking sights just short train rides away (the monument-filled Belem and the absolutely surreal Sintra). Yet the most magical part of Lisbon is the most simple: one of my favorite experiences in the city was staring out onto the water from Miradouro da Graça — drinking a beer, wrapped in a blanket, listening to the music of the church bells, and watching the sun set dramatically over the rooftops.
We arrived in Lisbon via train from Porto, arriving at the Santa Apolonia station from Porto Campanha. If you’re arriving from the airport, it’s an easy metro ride into the city, or a 20-minute cab ride. Uber is common and relatively cheap as a means of transport throughout the city, averaging 5 Euros per trip for really anywhere you’d want to go. For Tram rides, you’ll need to purchase a metro card in advance, either in a metro station or at any number of kiosks (we found one in Praça da Figueira).
For five nights, we stayed at this Airbnb in the Baixa neighborhood, pretty much in the center of the city, right on the Praça da Figueira. The Tram 15 (to get to Belem) was right outside our apartment, the Rossio train station (to get to Sintra) was barely a five minute walk, the main plaza was a three-minute walk… you get the picture. The apartment was bright, clean, spacious, and stylishly furnished. It’s certainly in the more touristy area, so the nightlife is sub-ideal, and you will find more tourist shops in the immediate vicinity than local, authentic cafés. The location is amazing, but if you’re looking for a more low-key, residential vibe with some cool shops and restaurants, I’d look into the Principe Real neighborhood.
Miradouros: The best way to experience Lisbon is on foot, and uphill. Miradouros are viewpoints located at the highest points of each hill, always with a space to rest and chill, and sometimes with cafés. Don’t waste your time paying for something like the Elevador Santa Justa — the best views in Lisbon are totally free. Miradouro da Graça was our favorite, with a spectacular view of the castle, the water, and the 25 de Abril Bridge (plus beers).
Sao Jorge Castle: This is one of the most popular attractions in Lisbon, but for some reason (maybe I’ve just seen too many castles) I came in with low expectations. However, this proved to be a wild misjudgment; we had a grand time exploring the grounds and enjoying 360 views of the city. The best move after visiting the Castle is to walk through the ancient, maze-like Alfama district on your way down, discarding Google Maps and just getting lost in the cobblestone alleyways full of color and character. Protip: there are two public elevators that make the climb up to the Castle way faster and easier. The first lift departs from a nondescript building in Rua dos Franqueros (170/178) and drops you off on Rua da Madalena. From there, walk a few hundred feet to the Pingo Doce supermarket, in which you’ll find an elevator that takes you another seven stories up, dropping you off right at the base of the castle!
Belém: Taking Tram 15 from Praça da Figueira out to Belém is a great way to spend half a day (or easily more) and experience its iconic landmarks (and equally iconic pastries). Our first stop was the world famous Pasteis de Belém, serving the world-renowned pastel de natas. Believe the hype. I typically won’t even look at a non-chocolate-based pastry or dessert, but these Portuguese custard tarts (whose 187-year-old recipe is guarded like the Hope Diamond, and only known by 6 people in the world) are truly divine. The protip here is to skip the intimidating queue for takeaway and head straight inside to table service, where the wait will be significantly shorter. Order as many tarts as you wish, but be sure to order the 6-pack for takeaway.
The Jéronimos Monastery was our next stop (just down the street from Pasteis de Belém), though we opted not to go inside, as the line was absurd, and we didn’t want to spend an hour or two waiting around (we happened to go on Sunday, 100% the worst possible day if you’re trying to avoid crowds). But the facade of the building is a sight in and of itself, and worth seeing for the spectacular Gothic architecture. A delightful surprise was the Padrão dos Descobrimentos monument right on edge of the Tagus River estuary, which was absolutely stunning and imposing. We capped off our tour of Belém with the aptly named Belém Tower, a 16th-century tower that memorializes Portugal’s Age of Discovery. It’s a beautiful building, which we enjoyed from the outside (again, the queue to enter the monument did not seem worth it), sitting on the steps on its periphery, and soaking in the architecture and the history.
Praça do Commercio: One of Europe’s biggest squares, this iconic Praça is bordered by bright, mustard yellow buildings. You’ll probably want to skip any and all restaurants and cafés inside the square (tourist traps), but you can’t miss checking out its grandeur, and walking right up to the river’s edge where you can sit on the ledge and look out toward the similarly iconic 25 de Abril Bridge.
LX Factory: For some real hipster vibes, check out LX Factory, an old industrial plant that was recently converted into a complex of 200 businesses (cafés, restaurants, shops, offices, and more). It basically feels like a mix of DUMBO and Williamsburg. One of the two highlights was Ler Devagar bookstore, any booklover’s dream. The second must-see is Rio Maravilha, a cool rooftop bar with great views of the river and the 25 de Abril Bridge. Grab a drink, head outside, and feel impossibly cool.
Parque Eduardo VII: This wasn’t a must-do on my list, but I wandered up the Avenida da Liberdade one day and strolled through this beautifully landscaped park with stunning geometric patterns. Starting at the entrance, you’ll actually walk uphill through the park, which results in a sweeping view over the city down to the river. There’s all sorts of events happening in the park at any given time — I happened to stumble across the Lisbon Book Fair.
A Vida Portuguesa: If you’re looking for an item to commemorate your trip but are allergic to cheap shot glasses and spoons, check out this beautiful store filled with authentic Portuguese goods — everything from soaps to notebooks to tinned fish to olive oils & jams.
Peixaria da Esquina: After Taberna dos Mercadores, this was our second favorite meal in Portugal. This restaurant is totally out of the way (we took an Uber) but we absolutely loved it. The cheese was dreamy, the rosé was delicious, the mineraly white was even better, the tuna ceviche was bright and refreshing, the clams a bulhao pato were not as good as Taberna dos Mercadores in Porto but were still legit, and the rice dish with shellfish was the absolute bomb. We ended up getting a third glass of wine “for dessert” and it was one of our best dining choices in recent history. It’s a small and intimate space where you can watch the chefs in action, which is something I always love.
Bairro do Avillez: This is chef Jose Avillez’s huge, impressive venue containing four separate restaurants. It’s worth a visit just to see this place, but the food is pretty great, too. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals at both the Taberna on the bottom floor (get the suckling pig sandwich and the meat & cheese plate) and the Peruvian Cantina on the top floor — get the creamy seafood ceviche, the potatoes stuffed with oxtail, the choclo with cheese and basil, and the fried rice (plus a pisco sour, of course). I found it remarkable how all the restaurants inside cultivated their own distinct atmosphere, even when they were practically overlapping. It’s a gorgeous space and super reliable if you’re looking for a solid meal with great ambience.
Time Out Market: I was skeptical about this enormous indoor market lined with endless food stalls, but it’s hard to deny the appeal, and we ended up having a fantastic evening here. There are nearly endless choices (seriously — 24 restaurants and 8 bars) and every stall represents the best that Lisbon has to offer (at least according to Time Out magazine). Luckily I had done some research beforehand, or I would have been paralyzed with indecision. I hopped in line at Alexandre Silva’s place while my boyfriend, Vishal, grabbed us a meat and cheese plate from Manteigaria Silva (and some drinks), which kept our hunger at bay during the 30-minute wait in line plus an additional 30 minute wait for the infamous pork belly confit. Given the experience was entirely pleasant, I’d say the wait was totally worth it. After our meal, we popped over to Santini for gelato — my combination of hazelnut, nata, and chocolate was to die for.
Forno d’Oro: On my last day, I was craving something less traditionally Portuguese, and decided to check out this pizza place that made Eater’s list of 38 Essential Lisbon Restaurants. The chef was trained in Italy and makes exquisite Neapolitan-style pizzas, with burrata and mozzarella flown in daily from Italy. I savored every bite.
Bettina & Niccolo Corallo: If you are even remotely a fan of chocolate, or have ever looked at chocolate, you must stop here. This place is incredible. There’s not really a menu, so luckily I’d read beforehand (thanks again, Eater) that their 100% cacao sorbet is the hot ticket item, and it is truly otherworldly. Be sure to pick up some of their chocolate bars too, which are studded with any number of treats, from hazelnuts to toffee to cocoa nibs to ginger.
Plans on our last day got a bit foiled due to Vishal being violently ill, so we didn’t get a chance to check out Ponto Final (a restaurant with a brilliant view of Lisbon from the other side of the river), which was highly recommended by one of our friends (to get there, you take a ferry that’s right outside of Time Out Market). We also were planning to check out the traditional fado music scene in the Bairro Alto neighborhood, as I had booked a reservation at “Fado Inside the Box” at Adega Machado, which is a daily event from 5 to 6 PM in which two singers present a repertoire focusing on the main genres of fado. I’d read that it’s a great way to experience fado, without having to commit to a 3-hour show + dinner at a fado house where the food is pretty average. I also wished we’d had a chance to check out Cervejaria Ramiro, made infamous by Anthony Bourdain, where you can allegedly find the very best shellfish in all of Portugal (expect a long wait). We also missed out on visiting Park Bar, a rooftop bar which was highly recommended by two of my friends.
If you have more than one day in Lisbon — even just two days — one of those days absolutely must be spent in Sintra. With just a 45 minute train ride, you’ll be transported to a magical land of castles and palaces and beaches seemingly straight out of fairytales.
We left our apartment at 9:30 am to catch the 10:01 am train at Rossio Station (just five minutes away from our apartment). Huge mistake. We nearly missed the train because the line to refill metro cards was INSANE. A true horror show. Luckily, we caught the train with 4 minutes to spare, but please learn from our mistake and refill your metro card in advance. After a pleasant ride, we arrived in Sintra without a real plan. You’ll be instantly bombarded with folks offering all sorts of tours and tuk tuk rides. I hadn’t done much planning about the logistics of Sintra once we actually got there (completely out of character for me), so Vishal decided to take a chance on this one guy named Miguel who offered to take us around in his private car all day and show us absolutely everything. I was aggressively skeptical (we New Yorkers always think we’re being scammed), but this turned out to be possibly the best decision we made our entire trip. The price tag of 100 Euros was more than worth it, as his insider knowledge helped us skip lines, see some off-the-beaten-path sights, and generally just not have to worry about anything. It was a blast.
We started the journey at Chalet e Jardim da Condessa, a house straight out of Hansel and Gretel, where we bought tickets for the Castle of the Moors and Pena Palace. On our way up to the Castle, Miguel pulled over at a few viewpoints along the way, to orient us to the city. Our first real site was the Castle of the Moors, which was absolutely incredible. We walked all around the walls, braving the strong wind and absurd heights (my stomach was flip flopping). I was in total awe.
Next we went to Pena Palace, the stunning mustard yellow palace that seems ubiquitous on Instagram. We mistakenly decided to buy a ticket to go inside the palace, which required not only additional Euros, but waiting in line for 30 minutes, and then being herded like cattle throughout the palace (and it wasn’t even that interesting). Definitely skip this and just buy the ticket to walk around the terraces, which are a photographer’s dream.
We quickly checked out the Palacio de Monserrate (famously frequented by Madonna) which had an awesome view of Pena Palace, and the garden was beautiful. Then we headed out to Cabo da Roca, the westernmost point in Continental Europe, which was insane. Incredible views, and beautiful blue water as far as the eye can see. Definitely a bucket list item.
After Cabo da Roca, Miguel took us up to Sanctuario da Peninha which was arguably the show stopper of the whole trip, and there were no tourists to be seen. We basically climbed into the clouds and had a nearly 360 degree view of what felt like all of Portugal. It was windy, misty, and felt like what I imagine Scotland to feel like (Vishal supported the comparison, as someone who’s actually been there). It was unbelievably serene.

As a tourist guide who travels by the palate, and lived here for the last 5 years, you should check these these out.
I worked in Lisbon for the last 5 years as a tour guide.
From walking tours, Tuktuk Tours, Executive Black vans, and even boat tours after I got my Skipper License. I’ve done.
Honestly, I spent more time of my life wandering on the streets of that city than anywhere else in the world. But that’s for another talk.
It doesn’t matter the reason why you’re in Lisbon or where you came from, one thing is for sure.
You have to Eat.
And Lisbon will for sure satisfy your desire if you know where to look for.
I realize I could talk about all the traditional old-school restaurants with famous and amazing Portuguese cuisine. And I will, probably in another article.
But since there are thousands of articles on that already.
Today, I wanna talk about the restaurants that helped me stay on track when I decided to adopt a vegetarian Diet.
Not only that, also made me start loving stuff from vegetarian cuisine.

Lisbon is Portugal’s hilly, coastal capital city. It’s Europe’s westernmost city and the only one on the Atlantic coast. From imposing São Jorge Castle, the view encompasses the old city’s pastel-colored buildings, Tagus Estuary and Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge. Lisbon’s geography, weather, and history make it a great city for running. There’s a terrific 5-mile path along the Tagus (Tejo) River, going by important museums and landmarks. A lovely downtown (Baixa) run along Av. de Liberdade takes you by important squares and buildings, to Eduardo VII Park. For hills, run the narrow streets and lanes of the Bairro Alto or Alfama neighborhoods, up to the Castle or one of the Miradouros (view points). The largest park is Monsanto, which is now well connected to downtown via a recently completed ‘green corridor’– a path through a linear park. And if you like hill running, this is your city!
Our complete guide to running in Lisbon can be found on the Great Runs site.
Riverside Run. 4.7 miles one-way to Belem Tower. Wonderful run along the water, passing under bridge. Numerous landmarks.Alacantra Dock. 2.8 miles west to Belem Tower. 2 miles east to Caise de Sodre.Monsanto Park. The largest park in Lisbon, with many km of trails.

Highlight is the central walk with box hedges and a hilltop view. Green Route to Monsanto Park. About 2.5 km. northwest between Eduardo VII Park and Monsanto.Parque das Nações. Originally the site of Expo 98, now the ultra modern side of traditional Lisbon. Path along the bay-like Tejo River. Lisboa Marina to Vasco da Gama Bridge. A run along the river in the more modern part of Lisbon. Terrific 4 km waterside path. Baixa & Av. De Liberdade. Classic Lisbon run, from the River Tagus to Eduardo VII Park, through the Baixa and along grand Av. de Liberdade.Alfama Area. The oldest district in Lisbon. Enjoy the narrow maze of streets and hills. Bairro Alto. “Upper District” neighborhood just west of the Baixa. Narrow streets, lanes, and stair paths.

MeetnGreetMe together with our amazing travel blogger would like to share memories and some tips with you in case you have been thinking about visiting Portugal for a long time, or just decided to go there an hour ago! Today we will explore the best of Lisbon, Porto and Sintra. Together with Anastasia.
“At the beginning I will give you some general information about Portugal. Portugal shares borders with Spain and it’s the most western country in Europe — sounds interesting, am I right? If you want to have a condensed view of European landscapes, culture and the way of life, Portugal might be one of the best options for you. I have been there twice and I am sure I will go there again. My both visits were in February (Yes, it sounds cold but believe me, even in February it’s +18 and sunny…and nothing can spoil your time there).
I have visited only Lisbon and Porto and some small villages nearby (for me it is better to visit fewer cities but to feel them, rather than explore the whole “Europe on two feet a day”. That is why today I will tell you about these 2 cities.
How to get there?
As it was a planned trip, I booked flight tickets in advance (Warsaw-Lisbon-Warsaw) and it was only 80 euros (which is very cheap I think). From Lisbon to Porto I travelled by bus — 4 hours and 20 euros- may be you will find a cheaper way to get there, but I didn’t have enough time for it and used a simple intercity bus.
Lisbon is the capital and the largest city of Portugal. Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world, and the oldest in Western Europe. There are a lot of tourists all year long and you have to be prepared for much attention (especially if you are a woman), tasty food, good wine and hospitality….let’s go!
I will tell you about places I have visited and advice YOU to visit!
Rossio Square (Pedro IV Square)
Lisbon’s most famous square. There’s no better place in Lisbon to soak up the local atmosphere than at Pedro IV Square. It has been the city’s main gathering place since the Middle Ages. Today, it’s the place where friends meet up and as a result it’s always crowded — you will not miss it.
Monument to the Discoveries
It is the mammoth white-stone Monument to the Discoveries. Do you all remember Vasco da Gama- the first European to reach India by sea….Yes-yes, he was from Portugal. Now you understand why they have this monument and so proud of it. You can ride an elevator to enjoy the view from the top of this Lisbon landmark.
Alfama
The oldest quarter in historic Lisbon, the Alfama district is dotted with architectural landmarks and it’s the charm of the neighborhood’s meandering streets, tasty food and wine, clubs with Fado (amazing music) that make the Alfama a can’t-miss destination.
And one more life-hack — Tram line #28
The historic “tram” takes you through the city’s oldest sectors past some of Lisbon’s most popular sights and attractions. You don’t have to pay extra money (the ticket costs like a normal one — 3 euro).
Belem Tower
Belem Tower, also known as the Tower of St. Vincent, this statue was designed to protect sailors on their voyages, faces the river and makes an incredible impression on you.

I fell in love with Lisbon probably on the day I was born, even though I never got it until I started to travel through the world.
When I started traveling, I began to look at my city with the eyes of a tourist, and that's the best way to find some hidden secrets or to look at places where you normally just pass through without even looking.
I’ll just share with you some 5 places not to miss in Lisbon and help you get as enamored with my city as I am.
Lisbon is such an old city that one of my favorite neighborhoods is older than Portugal, being over 100 years old.
It’s one of those more typical neighborhoods in Lisbon where you can Fado houses and still see a bit of an old times type of life, with a thigh community in the middle of a big city.
It had become a very touristy place in the last couple of years, but it’s still possible to get lost and find some old stores, where you can find fun trinkets.
Fado is part of the tradition not only in Lisbon but specifically in this neighborhood, where you can find a “Casa de Fado” almost in every corner.

This year I had the opportunity on both attending and speak at Droidcon Lisbon, in Portugal. It was an amazing first edition filled with amazing speakers and friends from throughout the country.
Recently I was searching for the slides of one of the talks and noticed that there was no global repository with them all, so well — now there is 🙌🙂.
If by any chance you’ve got slides that I ‘m missing — feel free to comment here or just ping me on twitter so I can add them 🙂.
None of this would be possible without the Droidcon team who organized the event, the speakers, sponsors, and of course all the attendees — thank you!
See you all next year 🚀

The final day on any trip is always a bit odd as there is a more clock watching brief to bear in mind as at some point there is that need to head off to the airport, you can’t just say sod it and get the next plane instead. And there is the packing, much of which on this trip meant refolding unused clothes we had brought. Mainly because there was the idea that we would come back in the evening, get changed, and then go out for food. Which didn’t happen at all, plus there was a bit of doubling up with hot and mild weather clothing. The unused side of the main case was a lot fuller than the dirty washing side.
Breakfast was the usual lunacy. We had been noticing little oddities, but I’ve rolled them all up into a leaving day edition. There has been a man in the hotel all week. Easily recognisable as he’s about 6’ 5”, bald and shiny at the front of his head, and then a foot long mullet down the back. He’s been getting a glass (for the fruit juice) and using it for coffee, pressing the americano button on one of the machines, and then whipping the glass out before the milk is poured (there is another machine which does just black coffee). He will then disappear, leaving the rest of the family in the restaurant, and then he would be back ten minutes later to do the same coffee routine all over again. It wasn’t until this morning that we saw where he was going. He went outside and sat in his car with the door open to drink his coffee, occasionally playing with the windscreen wipers (it wasn’t raining). I’m not who was happier with this arrangement, him, or his family.
Coffee in a fruit juice glass may sound weird, but there are always lunatics trying to go one better. In addition to mullet man, I have seen someone take a bowl (which is there for the cereals) and do their coffee into that. And conversely someone using a coffee cup to put their cereals in. Additionally, the breakfast room had a little Danone fridge in the corner, on investigation, it was full of Nestle yoghurts. I thought I wasn’t a morning person, but shit, I’m a fully functioning person compared to some of these.
Anyway, after the breakfast fun and games and packing, we checked out, left the cases, and went out for our last little wander of the trip. The fact we had dressed for going home and I had jeans and a jacket on meant it was bright sunshine and no rain.
We headed to the Edward VII park. It had been set out when most of the city was rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake, but they renamed it in honour of the visit of our king to the city in 1903. And for some reason they never renamed it back after he went home. Weirdos.
The park slopes gently uphill. Of course it does, this is Lisbon. You are going to be hard pushed to find anywhere flat to build a park.
About halfway up is the Pavilion Carlos Lopez which has some beautiful blue and white tiled scenes from history upon its walls.
In front of one a woman, and her photographer friend are set up. She has six juggling clubs with bright orange ends which she is juggling in front of the tiles while her friend takes phots from differing lengths away. When I say juggling, perhaps trying to juggle would be a more accurate description. When she drops most of the clubs, Helen and I say in unison, ‘sack the juggler.’
At the top of the park’s slope is a modern sculpture to the 1974 revolution.
And in front of it is the wonderful view down the hill, back over the laid out gardens, to the statue to the Marques de Pombal (who laid out the new city after the earthquake) in the middle of the double roundabout, along the main drag of the Avenue de Liberdade beyond and then there in the distance is the river.
Having come up one side of the park we go to amble down the other side and as we do we find ourselves outside the Lisbon Greenhouse.
It is a botanical garden, and we had seen the roof from above and the side and not twigged it was the greenhouse we had seen marked on the map. It is huge.
And full of greenery you may be surprised to know.
And flowers.
None of which I know the name of. Helen does, she knows most of them, and tells me what they are. Contrary to popular belief, I do listen when she tells me stuff, but where plant life is concerned, my mind does not want to keep that stuff. Which is a bit strange considering how much utter crap it is more than willing to keep.
I did retain the names of two, but only because I was been deliberately silly about them. Apparently, Nathan wants a cheese plant. Of which there were loads here, so many in fact it was more like a cheese forest, and I would certainly be happy if there was such a thing as a cheese forest and that cheese would grow on trees.
The other being a wisteria. And that’s only because I was saying I had heard people were going mad about this flower. ‘Really?’ came the puzzled response from Helen. ‘Yeah, it’s wisteria hysteria.’ I will point out I already had my coat and hat on at this point.
It was quite interesting, and I don’t mean in an air quotes fingers kind of way. Plus I was taking the opportunity to try and get some macro photography of the various flowers done.
I don’t know what these white ones are called, but trying to get near enough to them to do a macro shot was difficult as the juggler and her photographer mate had set up in front of them and now had another hanger on with them. In the previous half an hour or so since we’d last seen them hogging things worth taking pictures of, the juggling skills hadn’t improved.
We had heard the peacocks, but it wasn’t until we were outside again that we saw them. Just strutting around and not being tortured by moronic tourists into fanning out their feathers in distress.
There was time for a last café stop, a final cappuccino and pastel de nata in the park before it was time to head back to the hotel and pick up the cases ready for the journey to the airport.
Which didn’t take as long as the journey out seemed to.
I had the camera ready for some of the station art,
and got some blurred shots, some that missed altogether, some with window reflections,
and a feeling that somehow we’d missed a couple of stations as I was sure I’d seen some much more striking examples on the journey into the city.
The journey through the airport was smooth, bag drop was easy and for a change it was Helen getting the grilling about bag contents. Security was fine, there was a bit of duty-free shopping (not that there is duty on boxes of pastel de natas, just idiot tourist premium). I had been hoping to find a Forca Portugal store, but there wasn’t one. Having gotten Sporting Lisbon and Porto pens and magnets the previous day, I thought I would complete the big three, only for the Benfica official store not to have them, and the Football Gate store to have the Sporting and Porto stuff I’d got the day before, but to do no Benfica stuff because they had their own store.
Passport control was quick, and both coming out and going back the border police have been friendly and efficient. Something that perhaps the US ones could do with coming and getting some training on.
The queue at the gate was the usual bunfight / free for all. No sort of order in being called up, just get your elbows out and shuffle slowly forward in the queue. Or do what we did and sit there and wait for the back of the queue to come to us before joining it. And then find that on the plane there was no one else on our set of three seats, and the overhead lockers were empty. Bonus. Then it is roll to the runway and away we go.
Overall the trip was great.
Lisbon is a wonderful city. There is so much to see and do and four nights is nowhere near enough time to do anything more than scratch the surface. It is good exercise too, rest assured that if you walk for more than a couple of minutes in any direction there will be a hill to climb up or shuffle down.
The food has been wonderful, and it is cheap. Everything has been really tasty, and they certainly don’t scrimp on their portion sizes (they must know people need feeding up to be able to deal with walking up all those hills). And the people are so friendly.
The Azulejos are wonderful, and there are many splendid examples of art on the tiles. Although the occasional one did make us smile for the wrong reason. This one was designed to represent justice with the scales. But all I can see is saggy tits. Which again, says more about me than anybody else.
The only downsides have been the very showery weather, which no one can really do anything about, and which hasn’t dampened our spirits anywhere near the amount they have dampened out clothes. And the attempted pickpocket / bag theft thing.
But we would definitely recommend coming back with more time to get around more of the city and beyond (Sintra is only 45 minutes away).

I came to Lisbon for the vibe.
What I got was a full-body workout, a minor existential crisis, and two pairs of shoes that now live in the trash.
Let me be clear: Lisbon is stunning. Lisbon is magic. Lisbon is the seductive European city that will woo you with pastel buildings, flirt with you using tilework, and then betray you with an incline so steep your knees will write a resignation letter.
This is not a walkable city. This is a city designed by and for mountain goats.
You know when a city greets you gently? When it says, “Hey, take it easy. Ease into it. Grab a coffee. Sit by the river.”
Lisbon doesn’t do that.
Lisbon hands you a map, points vaguely uphill, and says, “Figure it out, loser.”
I arrived with optimism. I had good shoes. I had snacks. I had a plan.
Thirty minutes later, I was clinging to a stone wall, sweating through my t-shirt, trying to decide if I should keep walking or roll back down into the harbor and let the Atlantic take me.

March 17 has passed, and the EDP Lisbon Half Marathon 2024 is over. I can share my personal impressions about the race. There was a lot of fun, but also things the Lisbon folks should work on.
The race kit was okay, including a T-shirt, a bib, a cap (an excellent choice, as you’ll see why later), a magazine, some bags of tea, a cereal snack, an electrolyte pill, and a magazine. A very useful kit.
The quality of the T-shirt and the cap was very good.
My running buddy and I chose to stay in the downtown area, near the Marques De Pombal, at the Marques De Pombal Hotel, of course.
Access to the race is limited, and you can only get there by train. All participants must use the Fertagus train to reach the starting line at the Pragal station. To access the Fertagus train stations, athletes can use Lisbon’s public transportation system (subway, buses, and trains) for free by presenting their BIB. You have to take the metro and get off at the Jardim Zoológico station to get there. From there, you don’t have to go outside; just follow the train sign to reach the train station.
While on the train, I kept looking for the “25 April Bridge” to realize that we were on the bridge, just under the road where we were supposed to be running soon. The train trip was short, about 10–15 minutes.
We arrived at the last station at 8:55, and the race was supposed to start at 10:05. We thought we had plenty of time to get to our designated start wave. I was supposed to start from Box2, while my running buddy was supposed to start from Box3.
The first thing we noticed was that the only accessway was pretty packed with many people.
We did not panic and just followed the path until we got stuck in a sea of people. We were blocked in that spot for 30–40 minutes with little information about what was happening. There were no staff or organizing people around, just some policemen blocking the access.
We also thought we had time and space to warm up, but this was almost impossible with so many people trying to get into the designated starting box areas. This was my first half marathon where I did not do any warmup or stretching, nothing. It was impossible.
This was also the first half marathon where I had to stay in line and wait for tens of minutes with little information about what was going on. It was clear we were very far from the starting area.
At some point, the crowd started to move gradually, and we managed to pass the first checkpoint. We reached a zone where someone was yelling instructions about which way you should take to get to your designated starting area. There were no signs whatsoever, just a single volunteer yelling and trying his best.
For me, this was terrible organizing. Although I was at the race one hour and five minutes before the start, I didn’t manage to get to my box in time, and I had no place to warm up!
By the time I got to the starting areas, the lucky ones had already been in the race for 6 minutes.
I started at last! But it was so crowded on the bridge that I was forced to run on a metal grill next to the asphalt car lane. You could see the water down below, and the running feeling was odd. Most runners avoided the grill, but it was the only option to get in front of other runners. And I kept running on that uncomfortable grill for almost 1-2 km, I believe.
I overcame thousands of runners since I started from the back of the herd, and two days after the race, I am still paying for that effort. Around km 8, getting in front of other runners became easy. Till then, you had to do a lot of maneuvering to get in front.
I give a big F for the start experience.
The weather in Lisbon in March is unpredictable; while in the morning it is a bit cold, clouds cover the sun, but as soon as you pass 10:30, the sun comes out and starts to shine and burn.
My Garmin watch said that the average temperature was 28 degrees Celsius (82F) during the race, with a maximum of 33 degrees (91F). The weather prediction was 24C, measured in the shade, but starting with km 9, the entire race was under a nice shining sun.
Starting with km 18, I began to count the number of people who fainted on the side, and I think I counted 10–15 of them. Volunteers and medics were trying to relieve their pain, but seeing so many people dropping out of the race kind of made me more cautious.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed this race and loved my time spent in Lisbon. I recommend visiting this city because it is very nice, has good food, is relaxed, is clean, and has many things to do. It was my second time here, and I will come back the third, fourth, and fifth times whenever possible.
In my previous post, I wrote that my Garmin watch was predicting a finish of 1:46:54, and I thought that it was being conservative. I wanted to achieve more of a 1:44 finish time. It seems that Garmin wasn’t far off from my result. I finished in 1:46:46, which is eerily accurate!
I have mixed feelings about Garmin!
I’ve added some more pictures at the end and recommend doing the Lisbon Half Marathon. It is a race designed for a PB, and you can visit a great city.
The only tip I have is to get to the starting line two hours ahead, and I’m not kidding!

This was my fourth Web Summit, Europe’s if not the world’s biggest gathering of those plying the tech ecosystem. The conference has grown considerably since its humble beginnings in Dublin where its organizers remain domiciled. It’s not just the number of conference attendees, but its growing footprint in other regions that sets it apart from other confabs. Its portfolio currently includes Collision in Toronto, Web Summits in Lisbon, Rio and Qatar, and Rise in Hong Kong (2025).
Here are some data points from the just-concluded Lisbon event:
The record-breaking attendance happened despite the conference founder’s ill-conceived remarks on the Gaza conflict two weeks before Web Summit started. It sparked an exodus of big-named sponsors and speakers, as well as the resignation of the founder himself.
Very quickly, however, Web Summit secured a new CEO, Katherine Maher, the CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, who plugged the leaks and, within two weeks, righted the ship.
One afternoon back at the hotel, we shared an elevator with Katherine, where we had a chance to let her know how much we enjoyed her opening night presentation. She appreciated the feedback.
Since attending the final Dublin-based Web Summit in 2015, I’ve fallen into a regular cadence at subsequent events, including two on-stage moderation sessions, judging the start-up Pitch competition, participating in Mentor Hours, attending a couple of speaker dinners, and carving out time to listen to some of the more noteworthy speakers.
Two themes permeated this year’s conference: AI and climate, with the latter dominating many of the startups presenting.
On the AI front, I took the stage with Mikayel Vardanyan, co-founder of unicorn Picsart, the largest all-in-one creative platform of photo, video editing, and design tools — now fully immersed in Generative AI for creating images and video.
This is quite an impressive company with 1.5 billion downloads. Still, I had to bring up Gen AI bias after my query on the platform for a “successful business person” turned up four images — all of the same 40-year-old white man. I also worried aloud about the likelihood of bad actors using deep fakes to manipulate public opinion. Yes, that means you, Russia.
In my second on-stage session, I sat with some veteran marketing execs to discuss the changing role of the CMO. I reminisced about Y&R Inc’s “whole egg” approach wherein advertising, PR, and direct response comprised the three legs of the marketing stool. (Brand identity/design was siloed away back then.) I suggested that Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall, giving today’s marketers vastly more tools with which to work.
I suppose the greatest satisfaction for me was gleaned from connecting with founders about their early-stage companies’ plans to change the world for the better. This happened on the Pitch Stage where I judged a handful of companies whose solutions to small and big problems didn’t fail to impress. I also had a chance to mentor three young founders in the climate space: Guillaume Mandolini of EVAS, Dragan Gelevski of EarthCare.ai, and Diogo Costa of EcoCradle, who had these kinds words to share following our session:
There were other notable encounters, including over lunch when former Trump chief-of-staff Mick Mulvaney plopped down beside my wife and me. He, alongside esteemed journalist Michael Isikoff, suggested a political scenario in which both Trump and Biden drop out of the race. I wasn’t buying it.
You never know who you’ll run into at Web Summit, but everyone there had an affinity for technology and how it will continue to change our lives and livelihoods. Even Mick Mulvaney was there to speak about the tech regulatory environment.

Lisbon’s Soft Whispers: Esoteric Love Amidst Portugal’s Historic Lore,https://medium.com/@esomelodan/lisbons-soft-whispers-esoteric-love-amidst-portugal-s-historic-lore-ae543c40eb79,"Sign up

Introduction:
In the heart of Lisbon, a city steeped in history and shrouded in mystery, magic pulses truly under the cobblestone streets. *Whispers of Lisbon* tells the story of Amara, a young historian with a gift for paying attention to the voices of the past, and Rafael, an enigmatic mother or father with ties to a historical magical order.
When their fates collide, they must navigate the secrets and techniques hidden within the metropolis’s winding alleys and get to the bottom of a centuries-old curse that threatens to consume them each.
As love blossoms amid the shadows, they discover that their destinies are more entwined than they may have ever imagined.
Chapter 1: Echoes inside the Alfama
Amara Mendes wandered via the slim, winding streets of the Alfama district, the oldest neighborhood in Lisbon.
The scent of grilled sardines and freshly baked pastéis de nata lingered in the air, blending with the faint notes of Fado music drifting from a nearby tavern.
As she traced her fingers along the historic partitions, she felt it once more — a faint, ghostly whisper that simply she needed to hear.

I didn’t mean to get lost in Lisbon.
I had landed with a rough map scribbled on a napkin, a backpack full of enthusiasm, and absolutely no clue how confusing the city’s steep, winding streets could be. I’d seen pictures of the iconic yellow trams, the tiled facades, and the miradors overlooking terracotta rooftops. But none of those Instagram posts prepared me for what it actually felt like to be completely disoriented in a foreign city, hungry, sweaty, and mildly annoyed with Google Maps.
It started innocently enough: a walk through Alfama, the oldest district in Lisbon, with its maze-like alleys and whispers of Fado music echoing from open windows. I turned one wrong corner, then another, and before I knew it, I was somewhere between “definitely not where I should be” and “oh, this looks kind of magical.”
That’s the thing about Lisbon — it forgives your mistakes by rewarding you with charm. One detour led me to a tiny café run by an old couple who didn’t speak English but insisted I try their homemade bacalhau. Another wrong turn led to a bookstore with poetry written on the walls and a cat sleeping on a pile of Portuguese novels.
By the time I figured out where I was (eventually — thank you, tram 28), I had stopped caring about the original destination. Somewhere between losing the route and finding a rhythm, I realized that this…

To avoid the worst of the carnage at breakfast it was breakfast first then get ready to head out this morning to get more touring done. It had been raining when we got up but was bright sunshine by the time we were leaving the hotel, only for the moment we sat on the tour minibus it to want to start to rain. And we were on a minibus whose roof was broken and stuck in the open position. But we stayed in our seats and toughed it out as it went from rain to bright sunshine, back to rain and back to sun again as we went round.
We were on the green route and done the stretch from Liberatores to the Castle the previous afternoon, but this time we did almost the full route, only getting off when we got back to the second Liberatores stop and hour and a half after the first one.
And I don’t give a shit if I am repeating myself, I would not want to be driving on most of the roads the minibus travelled on. In fact I would go so far as to say that driving in Lisbon is not for me full stop, but it does lend some insight to the story of the Portuguese taxi driver we had in Leicester back in the late eighties.
There is plenty to see on the way around and it is a struggle to get anything remotely related to good photos. Between dodging raindrops, the vibrations of the cobbled streets, there are angles to consider, bus frame to avoid, and when you think you’ve got it all lined up ready to go the lights change to green or traffic clears and the bus lurches forward with some sudden acceleration.
What the results look like will be interesting viewing once back home and they have all been loaded onto the laptop.
When we got off the bus, we chose a different road to wander down to get to the river, picking one which isn’t festooned with cafes and restaurants and full of desperate men trying to strong arm you into eating at their particular offering. The number of times you can run that gauntlet without just wanting to scream at them to fuck off is limited. The one we pick has a gentle incline to it, which is somewhat of a concern seeing as we are supposed to be heading down to the river. We reach the crest of the road and find it must have been more than a gentle climb. Either that or we are getting used to the hilly nature of the city, as the road down the other side is seriously steep, and we really didn’t think we’d come up so high.
At the top there was a mall, which we took advantage of to use the facilities (that is one thing about Lisbon which isn’t great, there aren’t very many public toilets at all, and so when there are, there are always queues). I’m queuing for a cubicle only for a little brat to queue jump and run in when the old man in there leaves. I take the next available one, and whilst in there I can hear the impatient brat shout to his dad, ‘I’m finished.’ His dad tells him to wait while he himself finishes. Only for the kid to yell ‘for fucks sake, hurry up, the Lego shop is closing.’ (It wasn’t it was half twelve and they don’t shut for lunch.) Hopefully, the Lego shop became the Lego-without shop for the little shit.
The road down takes us back to the Commerce Square and across to the river. It’s time for the next tour, only this time there is no bus, it is on the river. There’s a big river and tours on the river, so of course we are there, we’re well-known suckers for a water level view of a city.
We get some refreshments, sort out the correct token for the tour (part of the HOHO ticket), and find the correct queue (not as easy as it sounds) and get on the little boat. And when I say little boat, I mean it. We had seen the larger boats for other tour companies on the river, but this is tiny, like a minibus compared to the double deckers the others are using. But even so it isn’t full.
Again the weather thinks it is funny. It was bright sunshine as we sit having a bit of lunch, the rain only appears when we set off on the boat. It does have most of its plastic splash protectors down which helps. But not with taking photos.
But the rain does fuck off to be replaced by the sun before too long.
The original route is for the little boat to go down the south side of the river on the westbound leg of the journey, but with the rain, and the threatening clouds, it stays to the north and concentrates on the Lisbon side of the river.
Being out in the vast expanse of the river gives you an unobstructed view of how the city rises away from the river and the layers of buildings of all types rising into the hills.
The cargo terminal is fascinating (to me anyway). Just how huge the container ships are, and how the containers slot together to stack up and stay in place like a giant Lego set. (perhaps drop some on this on that kid from earlier).
And there is the bridge. You can see it is large from a long way away. But the sheer scale really hits home when you are going under it.
It had looked as if our little tour boar was going to ram the yacht, but we only passed close by to it just as we were both going under the bridge, which made a decent photo.
By the time we had made our way past the MAAT buildings we had been on the day before, and out to Belem, the sun was shining.
And there were plenty of opportunities to take decent photographs of the Monument to the Discoveries.
The Belem Tower is a much better photograph from the water than from the top of the tour bus as attempted yesterday.
This is where we turn around to head back and there is a terminal for people to get on and off as even the boat tour is a HOHO. Every other passenger got off, and were replaced by a new set, and off we went back to central Lisbon.
We crossed over to the southside of the river to do so. And besides the obvious tourist photographs of the Christ the King statue, there was much that interested me.
A bit further out to the west from Belem was this, which I am assuming is some kind of refinery type building.
Just before the suspension bridge is another very colourful refinery building.
There are egg shaped structures set into the slopes of the south bank.
And once past the bridge and all the way along the bank until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
We swing back over to the north side of the river and with the sun shining on the city along the stretch of government / municipal eighteenth century buildings painted in assorted colours, and the domes and spires of churches behind them, it has a very Venice-esque look to it.
When the little boat docks at the third of its little stops we get off. The wind whilst on the water has been bitter and we have walked the short stretch back to where the loop would be complete before, so we head off to look for food and to warm up.
The pier is close to where we ate on the first night we were here, and therefore we know that the Time Out Market is only just behind the buildings we can see.
But it is chaotic in there and we want to be able to just sit and relax, order something from a menu and have it delivered to a table, not try and work out which of the forty odd options to order from and then fight to try and find two seats together somewhere in the heaving mass of humanity in the middle of the hall.
We do take the opportunity to use the facilities though. Whilst I am waiting for Helen (the queue for the ladies is unsurprisingly longer and slower moving), I see a bloke go and drag his (I assume) other half out of the queue and shove her into the unused baby change facilities toilet. Once she is in there he is pacing furiously back and forth but gradually further away, and then outside. People who actually have babies to change are now queuing to use it. I get the feeling she’s had more than enough of his shit and is deliberately taking as long as possible or just hiding. Helen comes back before she reappears, but he’s not in sight, and we go the other way. Hopefully, there was a backway out and he’s still pacing there now. Alone.
We use the guidebook to see if there are any recommended eateries near to where we are, and it does mention a place within a couple of minutes’ walk the Rio Grande. A lovely old traditional restaurant with decorative tiles on the walls and old wooden beams.
What we didn’t realise when we went in from the front door was that the side window where we were seated overlooks Pink Street.
And outside our window as we eat there is a drag act in a skintight purple jumpsuit with a long blonde wig (which keeps trying to escape) on roller skates, and armed with a wheelie bin, who is entertaining / terrorising the passing tourists.
We had found Pink Street as we had wanted, but without even trying.
The food, as all food so far has been, was lush, and after getting past the drag act unmolested, we headed back up another different street towards the hotel. Where it was a case of have a bit of a rest and then change to layer up for yet another tour. This time the night bus tour. And not a single Harry Potter in sight.
Three of the others who had been on the previous evening’s walking tour were on this tour as well, making the fullest use of their tickets as well then. But on the whole, it was a sparsely populated bus when the tour set off. Which did mean it was good for me as I could move around a bit in the hope of trying to get some decent photographs.
It starts out fine as there is still reasonable light at 8pm.
But night is falling, and it is doing so quickly.
And whereas the camera can cope with any difficulties thrown at it in daylight, at night it struggles. (or to be more precise, I struggle to be able to set it up, so it doesn’t struggle as much.)
It can cope OK when it is dead still, but as the night tour doesn’t have and pick up points around it the only stops are at traffic lights, so there is a fair bit of motion to deal with.
And as light fades the camera tries to extend the shutter speed to let more light in, which when moving means blurring.
So there I am hoping for traffic lights to be red, or for magical traffic jams to appear.
To be fair I did get some reasonable shots whilst the bus was stationary.
But the one I wanted was when the route went over the bridge above Pink Street. I knew when it was coming, I had the lens at the right length of focus, I had the timing right, but the bus was moving too quickly as there was no traffic and no traffic lights and so it ended up a bit blurry.
It is dark by the time the hour-long tour is up, and we head back to the hotel. We had seen the café on the roundabout was open as the bus came past. Two minutes later as we pass it walking back it is closed and in darkness, so it is back to the room and chill.
There are no planned tours tomorrow, just us mooching on our last full day.

If there is one thing we understand, it’s the importance of your student accommodation towards your general student experience. What’s more, we know a huge factor is your student home’s location. You want to live in one of the best neighborhoods, one that’s just as perfect for you as your residence. If this is you, let us guide you through Lisbon’s best neighborhoods for students!
Definitely one of the best neighborhoods for students, it’s very, very popular with international students. Marquês de Pombal is known among the locals as the central business district of the city and also as a major transportation hub. With two metro lines crossing here, and something like 20 different bus lines to catch, you’re always just a shot away from any place in the city. During the day, catch the sun up in the Eduardo VII gardens and after nightfall head down to the Kiosk-bars of Av. da Liberdade for drinks with your friends. There are many student residences nearby, including several that are Erasmus exclusive. Check out our student accommodation in Marquês de Pombal.
An Erasmus favorite! If you don’t want to have to go to parties, but prefer the parties to come to you, rent a room in the Bairro Alto. From Thursday to Saturday, the crowds fill up every one of the tiny bars here and spill out onto the streets. Thankfully, it’s quiet enough during the day, so you can party as much as you want throughout the night and then spend your mornings taking it easy inside. Friendly warning, you guys: Bairro is for party-animals only. Check out our student apartments and studios in Bairro Alto.
The large avenue (Alameda d. Afonso Henriques) that gives this area its name has a very wide garden with plenty of places for taking in Lisbon’s great weather and a kiosk-bar where you can have one of the coldest — and cheapest — glasses of beer to cool off. The streets to the sides of Alameda have plenty of student flat shares that are popular with Portuguese students, especially students of Instituto Superior Técnico (- called IST, or Técnico, for short). Click the link if you want to check out some student shared apartments in Alameda.
The neighbourhoods of São Sebatião and Saldanha are between three of the main universities of Lisbon: Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Nova), Universidade Católica de Portugal (Católica) and Técnico. It is not surprising, then, that you will find a student in nearly every building of the area. Some places like Bairro Azul are almost entirely occupied by students. It has great transportation options, the Gulbenkian Foundation with its museum, library and gardens (useful whether you feel like art, a stroll or some study time) and El Corte Inglés, the huge department store that also has over 12 cinema rooms. Click the links if you want to browse for student apartments in Saldanha or to rent student accommodation in São Sebastião.
Alfama is not only the historical quarters of Lisbon, it’s the city’s heart and soul. This is a personal favourite of mine — the neighbourhood where I have always lived. You’ll find there is nothing more charming than Alfama’s crazy, maze-like streets, and there is no better way of taking in the city’s culture than getting lost here. At night, you can hear Lisbon’s traditional music, Fado, being sung from a hundred little restaurants. Houses and apartments are traditionally rather small and hundreds of years old, but some studios and apartments have been recently refurbished and make the perfect student homes to live in. Interested? Click the link to see student accommodation in Alfama.
Thanks for reading this post! We hope to see you soon, coming back for more.
Did you enjoy our article? Just drop us a line in the comment section below to let us know you did. And remember! If you need to find accommodation in Portugal, you’ll find the perfect place to call home on Uniplaces.

This is an excerpt from my book One Family, which is available from Amazon.
At the start of the Second Crusade, troops sailing to the Holy Land, stopped, by chance, at Lisbon and helped defeat the Moors, resulting in Portugal becoming a country and Afonso Henriques (our ancestor) its first king.
Jose Saramago (Nobel winner) wrote a novel with the title The History of the Siege of Lisbon, which questions historical truth in a paradoxical, philosophical, and comical style that resembles that of Borges and Lem. At the same time he tells the love story of two employees at a publishing house in modern-day Lisbon, a proof-reader and his boss.
The proof-reader, succumbing to an inexplicable urge, changes one word in a history book about the 1147 siege of Lisbon. The Crusaders say “no,” instead of “yes.” They sail on rather than stopping to help fight the Moors.
A woman hired to supervise proof-readers and prevent another such egregious error is intrigued by the implications of the mistake and by the proof-reader himself. She surreptitiously suggests that he write a novel that explores the possible consequences if that “no” had been historically true.
The narrative switches back and forth between present-day Lisbon and an alternative medieval past written by the proof-reader. His version of what happened is consistent with the fragmentary historical evidence, and is credibly told, with gritty texture and the addition of a love story that parallels his romance with his new boss. The Crusaders’ decision, rather than creating a tornado of consequences and changing all that came after, only leads to differences in how the battle is won and who deserves credit; the outcome is the same. The rip in time caused by the change from “yes” to “no” closes as if it had never happened. The fictitious version of events, created by the proof-reader, might be closer to what actually happened than the official version.
Saramago turns what might otherwise have become an academic discourse on history, fiction, and truth into an entertaining double love story that plays out in the same city, but separated by 850 years. In this book, facts aren’t as important as they’re usually represented to be. There are a few well-known fixed points on a time line, and there are numerous possible story-paths from one point to another, all of which are equally valid, because they lead to the same conclusion. By looking at more than one possible path, you come to know the characters and their circumstances with the texture, ambiguity, and shading of reality, with its dynamic tensions and ever-changing possibilities, rather than with the static view of linear historical narrative. The author succeeds in showing the heroic and passionate potential of everyday people in everyday circumstances.
I wish I could achieve such a result.

At Christmas I got several photography books in the Abandoned / Oblivion series of books published by Jonglez; Abandoned Churches, Abandoned Spain, Abandoned France, Abandoned USSR, Oblivion, Forgotten Heritage, Forbidden Places. I’ve had a look at the other titles in the series (USA, Belgium, Australia, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Germany) but was surprised to find there isn’t one for Portugal.
Having spent four days wandering around Lisbon I am sure that an intrepid urban explorer and photographer could fill such a book with examples from Lisbon alone.
There are lots of properly abandoned buildings all over the place of all shapes and sizes.
Some on the main streets of the city, boarded or shuttered up.
Peeling paint or plaster disappearing from the surface of the buildings helped along by the constant weathering.
Nature is trying to reclaim some of these for itself. There is a lot going on.
Unlike a lot of examples included in the series of books I have seen and have mentioned above, these aren’t necessarily isolated buildings. They sit in and amongst fully functioning, well kept and maintained, houses, shops, restaurants, and other businesses.
It is oddities, it isn’t like they are whole blocks left to go to rack and ruin. I may have seen one side of a street where all the buildings looked to be abandoned and on their last legs, but that was the exception rather than the rule.
To the south of the city and all the way along the bank of the River Tagus opposite Lisbon, from the April 25th suspension bridge going to the east until the river opens out into its inland bay was a stretch of abandoned riverside buildings.
They look as if they must have been industrial units, but the whole stretch is mainly roofless, and the graffiti artists have been out in force.
It did look as if there was one little bar in amongst it all. But there was no obvious route down to get to the stretch of buildings. How would someone get there?
I am fascinated by this stretch of buildings, but as to how to get in there, I’m better off not knowing as I would just have spent a lost day wandering around the whole stretch clicking away and filling up my SD card.
And the spare one.
There are other buildings in disrepair, but they at least show signs of being worked on, metal and wooden fences surround them. There are piles of materials around, and there are cranes hovering above them.
I suppose if you went and looked hard enough in any town or city you would find examples of abandonment, but it feels different in Lisbon, I haven’t gone searching for examples, it is almost as if they have come to me. Though what I find strange now that I am home and I am searching through all the photographs I took, is ones I am sure I took of abandoned and crumbling buildings aren’t there, which makes me doubt my sanity. Most of the ones I have are of the riverside.
But I don’t speak the language and therefore don’t know what any notices on buildings may be saying. I don’t know what the law is about entering such buildings, and how the police would deal with such things. And most importantly I am on holiday with Helen, so I don’t go looking for that opening, for a chance to get inside one of these buildings and snap away.
Perhaps someone will, or there is someone already doing it, or even someone has already done it, and it is the next Jonglez abandoned series one to come out.

After two days of being toured out, it was time for a bit of freestyling. It did still start on a bus though. A regular Lisbon public transport one, taking us down to one of the main squares in the centre of the city. Whilst waiting for it to turn up I was admiring the doors and doorways as I usually do (yes, I know I’m strange), and I saw this one close to the bus stop.
Noting the number twenty-five above it, I spent the rest of the day looking out for any other doors or doorways with the number twenty-five above them. It was a surprise just how many streets there were where the numbers stopped at twenty-three, or upon which the number twenty-five was missing from above the doorway where number twenty-five should be. Still, I got plenty for the little side project that had popped up in my head.
We were on the bus to the end of the line at Rossio, and from there we started the long slow ascent up through winding narrow cobbled streets and steps up (and some back down again thirty yards further down the same road).
Some of the streets in this area have poignant pictures attached to the walls, some project which took photographs of those who live, or used to live in the houses there and they have been reproduced onto boards in an almost sepia colour, the history from inside the walls being displayed on the outside of them.
There were a couple of stops to do some shopping for tat. The usual, pens, postcards, fridge magnets. But we made it up to the castle entrance.
Which was a lunatic asylum. The queue was stupidly long, and there appeared to be three different sub queues and people changing between them because they didn’t know which one was the correct one to be standing in.
We weren’t desperate to go inside the castle and so we wandered the streets around the castle complex at the top of the hill. We saw (and heard) peacocks. Only for some dicks to come along and deliberately spook the peacock so it expanded its tail feathers as a defence mechanism. There really are some stupid humans around.
There are also Azulejos on walls everywhere in many different patterns and assorted colours (which triggered another thought for another little set of photographs for a project).
Before we stopped for a drink in a café called Tram 28. (Named for the tourist tram which rattles up the narrow streets to the castle and always looks like a sardine tin on rails.) The inside looks as if it has been built from two trams pushed together. A drink turned into lunch and a postcard writing session before we headed on.
And it isn’t everywhere where you are going to find a Tram Burger.
Across the little square was a church, we went in one side and out the other, and briefly thought about going up the tower, but a rude German family pushed in, and we saw the cost, and decided against it.
Instead we continued wandering around the narrow streets, gradually making our way down and out of the castle complex.
We then did a bit of retracing steps, following a bit of the route down from the castle to the cathedral which we had taken on the waking tour a couple of evenings before. I nipped into the cathedral to get a fridge magnet and a brief dodge of raindrops before heading on.
And out the other side we were then walking on street not previously travelled. More narrow streets, little alleys, steep staircases up, and down, between all sorts of buildings.
Unlike the planned grid of the centre of the city, this part of the city, Alfama, the oldest part, a lot of which survived the earthquake of 1755, wouldn’t know a grid if it hit it found the face with one of the cities beloved sardines. It is wonderfully winding, and you might spy where you want to be heading, only to find a couple of minutes later that it is in a totally different direction to the one you thought you were heading in. We pick up a couple of pastel de natas to help us along the way.
It is in this style we wander the streets before eventually finding our way up to the church of St Vincent. Which is absolutely huge. And wants to charge for you to go in.
But they, as the cathedral did, have some doors available for you to go in and sit in the back two rows of the nave of the church and get a long-distance view of the inside of the church (easily overcome with a zoom lens).
The intermittent showering has turned into constant drizzle, and the back two rows of the church were a brief interlude, we stop at a café to, if not dry off, then at least stop getting any damper. A drink and a pit stop later, and it is back out.
It is still raining. We make it down to the former church of Santa Engracia. This baroque church is no longer a place of worship. It now houses the Panteao Nacional (The National Pantheon).
This time we do pay to get in, a prolonged break from the rain will be good. The building houses the cenotaphs and tombs of famous and influential figures from Portuguese history.
It is a serious space, but I can’t help it if my head is the opposite of a serious space, and seeing this name on one of the cenotaphs, I can’t help but ask does it also contain a hot dog, and a jumping frog.
A lot of the tombs now housed here were originally entombed at the Jeronimos Monastery before they were moved here in the 1960s. Reading the biographies of the people here next to each of the monuments, you can’t help but notice just how many of them went to the University of Coimbra, which must be the Portuguese equivalent of going to Oxbridge.
We are able to go up to various levels, where there are displays of reliquaries, and collected artworks.
And then we are up at the dome level. There is an exit out onto the (nearly) flat roof.
On a clear dry day, the views out over the city and the river must be spectacular. But it is neither. The April 25th Bridge and Christ the King statues are barely visible through the low cloud / rainfall. But it does seem to be easing off.
Inside the dome there is a walkway all the way around the dome. It is a long way down. My knees were going (and not just because of all the steps climbed to get up here) and the head was a bit woozy.
By the time we had made it back to ground level and had a walk around the former church and chapels looking at all the luminaries in big marble boxes (including, in a surprise to me, the footballer Eusebio), and headed back outside, it had stopped raining.
And so the wandering around continued. There are museums everywhere it would seem. To everything. In fact I think all that is missing is a museum to museums.
We find ourselves back at the river, only to turn and head away from it again and head back towards where we had gotten off the bus this morning on the search for somewhere for us to have our traditional away on holiday curry. There was a detour to find a post office so we could send the postcards we had written earlier.
Still it is trying to rain intermittently. We had seen a potential place on giggle maps and head into an alley off a side street, go up some steps for a change and find the basic looking Nepalese / Indian restaurant.
It may look basic, but the food is amazing, and it is so cheap. Two meals and two drinks each only come to thirty-one Euros. I can see why it is a 4.9 on Trip Advisor. The place is called ODAAN, it is hidden away, but definitely well worth finding.
When we come out the rain has stopped, and the sun is out. There isn’t a cloud in the sky now. And so we head for the Santa Justa lift. As we pass through the square the queue for the 28 tram is as ridiculous as it has been every time we pass here. It may be the iconic symbol of Lisbon tourism, but seriously, who wants to be Lisbon’s favourite dish — sardines — on a tram, hardly able to see out of the windows on the trip up. You’d be far better off having a slow walk up following the tram tracks and being able to see it all.
Having mocked others queuing, there is a queue for the Santa Justa lift, built near the turn of the twentieth century by a disciple of Gustav Eiffel. Only one of the two lifts in its tower are working, but the queue moves quickly enough. It connects the centre of the city with the Bairro Alto high above it.
Once at the top of the lift, the little spiral staircases up to the upper level of the viewing platform are closed, but the views out from lift level are worth the cost of coming up in it.
With the clouds having finally buggered off for the day there are magnificent views out over the city, across to the castle, and down to the river.
And behind it over the Carmel monastery which the exit from the lift takes you past.
It was one of the main flashpoints of the 1974 revolution, and it is a ruin, with little of the roof left on it. Some is used to house a museum. Unusual for Lisbon, I know.
We have been through this area on the bus but find some streets we haven’t been along to walk down (or more accurately at this point up).
The buildings are being lit up, including this theatre bathed in pink light.
There is another viewing point over the city, it is by the top of the funicular we went down in on our first night here. The castle opposite is lit up in green light, but for some reason the camera doesn’t want to know that and will only take the photo with it in an orange glow.
Once you have got past the mass of self-obsessed, selfie taking Instagrammers which plague viewpoints the world over now. Saying that we did try to take a selfie, but the reason we don’t usually take selfies is because we’re both shit at it, and the more photos I seem to have taken of me recently, the more my eyes are changing into the bastard sons of Marty Feldman’s.
The Bairro area is lined with huts serving food and drink and we grab drinks to go and head up roads we’ve been on a tour bus going in the opposite direction to.
I’m still trying to take nighttime shots of interest as we pass.
Helen mentions it would be nice to get some cheese, but there is nowhere open that sells cheese. We see a pharmacy (always a plus), and joke that it should be possible to get cheese on prescription.
We end up on another very steep downhill path, so much so they have made half the footpath into steps. At the bottom it isn’t far to get to the hotel, and time to collapse and rest.
And to try not to think that we have to go home tomorrow.

It was supposed to be a chill walk.
I had Spotify in my ears.Google Maps in my hand.And absolutely no idea where I was going.
Welcome to day 2 of my solo trip.Sunburnt, sleep-deprived, and 100% lost in Lisbon.
Not a premium member or account? Click here it’s free :)
I didn’t.
Instead, I kept walking.Up a street that was definitely a hill.Through a park that might’ve been private property.Past a guy yelling at pigeons.
Until I sat on the edge of a fountain, next to a trash can, and cried behind my sunglasses like a drama queen on a budget airline.
I was crying because I was tired of pretending I wasn’t.
Not just that day.In general.

No subscription? Read it here.
We went to The Obsidian Room near the river to celebrate closing the Lisbon project.
No pricing anywhere. Dark wooden panels. Thick white tablecloths. Everything was heavy. Even the metal-sleeved menus.
Hugh was there with a few others from the team. My team. A couple of the finance lot joined. The rest were clients who’d flown over from the States.
There was champagne on arrival. Everyone was shaking hands, swapping cards, patting backs. All smiles now that it was over and I’d made them look good.
When we sat, one of the Americans started a speech in my honour. I bowed my head. Humble.
He raised his glass. “To Lisbon.”
Caught Hugh watching me, just for a second. I was on top. He knew it. Everyone knew it. He didn’t like it.
I stood, “They said it couldn’t be done. But I didn’t listen.”
A few cheers.
“You’ve still never beaten me on the courts, though!” Hugh was grinning over his glass.
A few polite chuckles. His way of getting one over me.
“No,” I grinned back, “but you’ve never beaten Lisbon.”
Raucous laughter. That shut him up.

The light lingered, warm against the cold marble arcs of the quiet convent, as I walked in. As my eyes wandered along the neat rows of sun chairs, my nose travelled to the long summer evenings of my childhood, that smelled of sweet popcorn and cotton candy.
I had never been to an outdoor cinema before, so when my friend suggested we go, I jumped at the opportunity. Now, standing here, I was glad I did.
The re-run was the 1999 teen comedy, “10 Things I Hate About You”. A classic “chick-flick” which I have admittedly watched several times before. It’s a light-hearted love story that ends well, and gives you the right amount of 90’s nostalgia.
Before you go off questioning my taste in movies, I didn’t decide to spend 10 euros on this particular occasion for the sake of the film in question. I spent the 10 euros for the experience.
And an experience it was.
From the moment we stepped into the soft afternoon glow of Graça, I was already in my own outdoor movie. Like a dream within a dream.

Discussing Azure, blockchains and… machine learning rap
This past week was quite eventful for me. I attended the school-symposium DATA Science 2018 — in (Astro)Particle Physics and the Bridge to Industry (about which which I’ll have a post soon) during the whole week, but on Wednesday I went to Microsoft’s headquarters in Lisbon for the 5th PyData Lisbon Meetup | Special Edition.
It’s impressive that the PyData Lisbon community has already more than 500 members as there had only been four events beforehand (the first one in last September). The fifth meetup had 200 participants (the maximum that the Microsoft’s auditorium would allow) and for a good reason: the YouTube phenomenon Siraj Raval was in the house!
But before we met Siraj Raval, there was the talk “We ran out of memory” by Silvio Rodrigues and Tim Kock, two of the founders of Jungle AI, a young startup specialized in predictive intelligence. It dealt with machine learning at scale, using the Azure cloud platform by Microsoft to solve problems which cannot be handled by a laptop.
As a beginner in these things, it was fascinating to me to see such large scale machine learning being used in real-world situations. Even though I wasn’t able to follow every single detail, the informality and joviality of Tim Kock kept me engaged in the presentation.
After a small break for some pizza and beer (thanks Microsoft!), it was time to listen to Siraj Raval, with his presentation “AI Networks”, which you can find in his GitHub. He mostly discussed the next phase of the Web, “Web 3.0”, focusing on blockchain technology and decentralized applications.
I’ve only come across Siraj’s YouTube channel a few months ago while I was searching for videos about machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I was very surprised by the enormous number of subscribers. Who knew so many people would watch videos discussing machine learning algorithms and frameworks?
And apparently some of his early videos had him rapping about these concepts! I hadn’t watched any of them, but Siraj was kind enough to showcase his abilities during the Q&A. I confess that that was not what I was expecting to see when I went to this meetup.
Overall, it was an entertaining evening . If you’d like to check, the event was live streamed on Facebook — and, yes, it includes the rap at the end.

In Lisbon, the soul of the city is written in azulejos. These hand-painted ceramic tiles cover the facades of its oldest buildings, shimmering in sunlight and rain alike, whispering the stories of the city’s past. But walk through Lisbon today, and you’ll notice gaps where tiles once clung — empty spaces on walls like missing teeth in a smile. Construction sites pile broken tiles alongside debris, while sleek new developments encroach on neighborhoods that once hummed with history. It’s here, amid the rubble of modernity, that Serra Behar steps in.
Serra, an artist and a neighbor, isn’t just creating art; she’s waging a quiet, poignant battle to preserve Lisbon’s identity. Her exhibition, Autoimmunity and Allergy, now showing at MAD Gallery, speaks to the fragility of the azulejo, but more importantly, to the fragility of the systems and memories they represent. Each azulejo Serra collects — chipped, cracked, or discarded — is a piece of Lisbon’s story that she refuses to let fade away.
The Artist as Caretaker
For Serra, saving azulejos is an act of care. “Each tile I pick up feels like rescuing a fragment of the city’s memory,” she tells me, her tone both determined and wistful. Her work begins on the streets, where she searches construction sites and demolition zones for tiles that have been cast aside. These aren’t perfect tiles — they’re worn, their colors dulled by time, their edges chipped. But that’s precisely why Serra finds them beautiful.
“They’ve lived,” she says simply. And now, they live again through her art.
At MAD Gallery, her rescued tiles are arranged in installations that feel both meticulous and tender. The rawness of the broken tiles contrasts with the clean gallery space, making the viewer hyperaware of their imperfections. “They’re not supposed to be perfect,” Serra explains. “They’re supposed to remind us of what’s been lost — and what’s worth saving.”
Saving Lisbon, One Tile at a Time
Lisbon, like many cities, is caught in a paradox. Its history is its greatest asset, but its future is being built at the expense of that history. Serra’s work grapples with this tension. Through her art, she shows how azulejos — these seemingly small, decorative objects — are, in fact, vital to the city’s identity.
The azulejo is more than an aesthetic flourish; it’s a language. Its patterns and colors speak of Portugal’s Moorish past, its maritime adventures, its religious traditions, and its modernist movements. But when these tiles are removed, the city loses a piece of its voice. The smooth, glassy surfaces of new construction might glimmer, but they are mute.
Serra’s mission is to give those missing tiles a voice again. By presenting them as art, she forces us to see them not as relics but as witnesses. Each crack and chip becomes a story: of the artisan who painted it, the wall it adorned, and the generations who passed by it on their way to somewhere else.
The Skin of the City
Serra’s exhibition title, Autoimmunity and Allergy, is not a metaphor she chose lightly. She compares the removal of azulejos to a skin condition, where the protective outer layer is damaged, leaving what lies beneath exposed and vulnerable. “Tiles are the skin of buildings,” she says. “They protect the structure, but they also define its character. When you strip them away, you expose scars — not just physical scars, but cultural ones.”
Her metaphor extends further. Just as the body can attack itself in autoimmune diseases, cities, too, can turn on themselves. In the rush to modernize, Lisbon has unwittingly destroyed parts of itself, sacrificing its unique character for the sake of progress. Serra’s work asks a pressing question: Can we find a way to modernize without erasing? Can Lisbon save itself from itself?
A Quiet Resistance
There is a quiet, almost subversive quality to Serra’s art. She isn’t staging protests or writing manifestos. Instead, she’s walking the streets of her city, rescuing one azulejo at a time. Each piece she collects is a small act of defiance, a refusal to let history be discarded like construction waste.
At MAD Gallery, this resistance is palpable. The tiles are displayed not as ornaments but as artifacts. Serra has stripped them of their original context, forcing the viewer to consider their fragility and their significance. Some are arranged to emphasize their broken edges, others are mounted to reveal the raw, unglazed sides that were never meant to be seen. It’s as if the tiles themselves are saying, “Look at me. Remember me.”
The Power of One
In a city as vast and complex as Lisbon, the idea of saving it one azulejo at a time might seem quixotic. But Serra believes in the power of small, deliberate acts. “You don’t save a city all at once,” she says. “You save it piece by piece, memory by memory, tile by tile.”
Her work resonates not because it offers grand solutions but because it reminds us of the importance of paying attention. It’s easy to overlook the cracks in a facade or the gap where a tile used to be. But Serra’s art asks us to slow down, to notice, and to care.
An Invitation to See
As I left MAD Gallery, I found myself looking at Lisbon differently. I noticed the patterns on the azulejos of buildings I’d passed a hundred times without a second thought. I noticed where tiles were missing and where new ones had been added in their place. I noticed, too, the scaffolding that seemed to creep further into the city with every passing month.
Serra’s work had done what all great art should: it had changed the way I saw the world. And it had given me a simple but profound reminder — that saving a city isn’t just the work of governments or preservation societies. It’s the work of individuals, of neighbors like Serra, who care enough to save a single azulejo from being forgotten.
For those who haven’t yet visited Autoimmunity and Allergy, I urge you to go. And when you do, take a moment to reflect on the azulejos you see — or don’t see — on your way there. Each one is a fragment of Lisbon’s story, waiting to be noticed, remembered, and, perhaps, saved.

Ah, November in Lisbon, Portugal — what an exciting time!
Now, I’m not just talking about those amazing sunsets, the delicious food, or the stunning buildings and hidden gems scattered around the city.
No, I’m here for something special: the Web Summit.
This massive tech conference is one of the biggest in the world.
It’s a place where you get to learn so much and meet all these amazing people from everywhere, all passionate about technology just like us.
While this year’s attendance wasn’t my first, it was, once again, an amazing experience.
When you attend a conference alongside 70,000+ people, your perspective changes.
Definitely, at one point I felt overwhelmed.
As I took in the surroundings, I considered the newcomers to this impressive conference and the questions likely swirling in their minds:
After pondering these questions, I decided to share a few words about my experience at the Web Summit in Lisbon and offer tips to help others feel more confident at similar events.
No one should leave such events with negative feelings about their participation or a sense of unproductivity. With some preparation, events like the Web Summit can unfold numerous opportunities.
I hope this article will guide you the next time you attend a large event, as it reflects what I wish I had known before going to my first major gathering.
Many Web Summit attendees are first-timers, and it’s crucial to acknowledge this. Beginners might feel overwhelmed in the fast-paced atmosphere and face common challenges of large events, making navigation seem daunting. With 70,000 participants, the event’s sheer size might lead some to dismiss it prematurely as not worthwhile.
However, I challenge that perspective. Events such as the Web Summit offer a phenomenal platform for learning and networking with influential folks from all over the world.
Still, first things first: your journey at Web Summits starts with your phone.
To maximize your benefit from the event, keep a few things in mind. First, make sure to download the event app, but be cautious about its potential drawbacks. While it provides maps, attendee lists, and other details, filtering people or presentations for specific niche topics of interest might be challenging.
Also, carefully consider how much you’ll rely on the app for networking because it is not primarily designed to facilitate engagement beyond the chat feature.
Consider in such an environment: how likely is it that those you message will respond?
Drawing from my personal experience: use the app for navigation, but avoid relying solely on it for engaging with people.
With numerous presentations occurring at the same time, it’s challenging to keep up with all of them. The venue is filled with ongoing presentations requiring constant movement.
In my view, the source matters more than the topic. A captivating title doesn’t guarantee the presenter’s relevance to the subject. I prefer finding relevant people and attending their presentations, regardless of the topic. Feel free to skip some sessions, as content is often repeated.
Consider your participation in the Web Summit as an investment. Approach it with curiosity and passion, asking questions and challenging ideas. Stay open to your peers’ ideas, as there are valuable learning opportunities. Strive to gain something from each presentation session, as this investment will yield dividends over time.
Friendly tip: Web Summit is packed with sessions, events, keynotes, and workshops. Prioritize the ones you can’t miss and plan your schedule accordingly.
And remember: no matter how hard you try, you’ll not be able to attend everything and be everywhere.
My next piece of advice is to schedule meetings in advance if possible.
This is the pre-event preparation phase I mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that first-time attendees may be eager to attend presentations and explore the venue, but meeting with the right people is crucial.
The people you meet at Web Summit could be your future partners, mentors, or investors.
You’ll only have one chance to make a fine first impression.
Friendly tip: At events like Web Summit, excellent opportunities often arise unexpectedly! Don’t hesitate to talk to unfamiliar faces and explore beyond your usual interests. You might uncover something surprising.
A key lesson from my experiences at Web Summit is the value of side events. They’re smaller, and more intimate, and people tend to prioritize building meaningful relationships. Also, make sure to have fun in the evenings. Many see Web Summit as a tech event that doubles as a big party, and there’s some truth to that.
The most valuable connections often happen when people are at ease.
Trust me on this one: feel free to miss a scheduled session for a lively discussion or a significant announcement happening elsewhere. Stay flexible, trust your instincts, and take advantage of chances to talk whenever they come up. Whether it’s a coffee break or waiting for a keynote speech, these unplanned interactions can lead to valuable new contacts.
Web Summit offers unique opportunities to network with individuals you might not have met elsewhere, such as an entrepreneur from Brazil, an investor from Costa Rica, or a remarkable founder from Japan.
Friendly tip: Don’t just focus on sales at Web Summit. Meet people, have engaging questions ready, and show genuine interest in their stories.
Remember Dale Carnegie’s advice: to be interesting, be interested.
If you have a goal for attending the Web Summit, make sure to plan accordingly.
For instance, if your goal is to generate leads or secure funding, take the time to prepare your pitch and craft effective conversation starters.
Also, decide where to focus your time to connect with the right people.
Your goal should determine your tactics.
Copying what everyone else is doing won’t lead to exceptional results.
Friendly tip: Bring plenty of business cards and prepare a concise elevator pitch about yourself and your business/interests. Nobody will dedicate an hour to intros, as time is a precious asset at the Web Summit — use it wisely.
My personal favorite spots:
Stepping into the vibrant world of events such as the Web Summit, it’s crucial to remember that balance is key. If you’ve reached this point, one thing is clear:
There is a lot to think about.
While the conference offers an ocean of opportunities, your success will rely on your ability to prepare and engage purposefully. Simultaneously, stay open to spontaneous connections and seize opportunities on the spot.
You know why you’re attending.
You’re there for a reason.
Keep an open mind and stay curious — a seasoned conference-goer knows it’s the unplanned conversations and unexpected learning opportunities that often create remarkable insights.
Most importantly, enjoy the process. Embrace the grandness of everything, the dynamics, as well as the rollercoaster of ideas and conversations.
After all, the true essence of large-scale events lies in the vast opportunities right in front of you.
Hope to see you next year in Lisbon!

Somewhere new for us to visit. I had been trying to find a location which would hopefully be warm in April and which neither of us had been to before, and being practical, somewhere which was a direct flight away from Gatwick. I was surprised by just how many places that ruled out. And how many places in Spain and Italy are code shared by BA ad require a change of plane along the way.
So I came up with Lisbon. Lots of variables around the dates, leave years, other events we were going to, and so on. So much so the fact that we were going during the week before Easter and all the kids would be off school passed me by completely.
It was a nice, civilised time for the easyJet flight from Gatwick to Lisbon, relatively painless apart from the ten-minute bus journey from the plane in the middle of a field somewhere to the terminal building. The Lisbon metro from the airport was straightforward. And the art in the stations was fascinating, if only I hadn’t got the camera buried away in my bag.
We popped out of the metro station, and it was two minutes to the hotel. For a change it isn’t an IHG one, as they were either in remote locations, or ridiculously expensive and had no points nights available for the four nights we were going to be here. So it is a random Booking.com hotel. Which looks decent enough in the lobby, but they are doing improvements on it. With it being a Booking.com choice we are in a before room. Which very much has an eighties Marbella vibe about it. But it is clean and has a comfy bed and its not like we’ll be spending much time outside of sleeping in it anyway. We’re going to be too busy being out exploring. Which after dumping the bags we were. It was a literal dump and run, no unpacking.
A bit of late lunch and we are off wandering down the city’s main boulevard heading towards the river. There is a market down one side of the boulevard, which we aren’t going to be distracted by, it isn’t a shopping trip. Besides aiming for the river there is no plan.
But as any regular reader will know we are easily distracted and tend to detour off at the slightest whim. There is no master plan for the trip as neither of us had looked at the guidebooks until we were on the plane. Though we have booked the standard hop on hop off bus tickets. As when don’t we?
The detouring didn’t take long to kick in as we saw a funicular off down a side street just a short walk from the main boulevard, and we headed over there for a ride up the side of the hill.
Lisbon is remarkably hilly, and most of them are steep. On the metro journey into the centre there were a couple of times where we popped out from being underground and suddenly found ourselves on a bridge over a valley before popping back into another tunnel.
Anyway, at the top of this funicular run is a short walk to gardens with views out over a lot of the city.
Next to the top of the funicular track is a building with an interesting tower and a spiral staircase up to the top. From which the views would be even better (even if it would be no good for my vertigo), but there is no public entrance to it. So we go back down and rejoin the main drag to get to the river.
A lot of the city was destroyed by a major earthquake in 1755, so most of the lower part of the city leading to the river was rebuilt in the late eighteenth century in a grid pattern, following what they had seen in Paris. They have managed to shoehorn some modern monstrosities in as they do everywhere, but there are some splendid examples of early twentieth century Art Deco buildings plugged into gaps as well.
They quite like a square here. There are some vast open paved spaces which we pass through on the way to the river.
And they certainly like a big old statue. A lot of the time it is a figure high up in the air at the top of a tall column, or as I got to be calling them as the trip went on, ‘another bloke on a stick.’
Anywhere they have a square, or a wide pavement, then they have cafes and restaurants spilling out into them. We are not going to struggle to find somewhere to eat on this trip.
Along one such alfresco dining mecca on a pedestrianised street we can see the grand archway becoming larger with each footstep.
Once through it, would you believe it, we are in another huge square. With a fountain in the middle (they do love a fountain, although not many of them have the water running), and on the other side of the square is the River.
It is the River Tagus (which I’m sure sees lots of people doing a tag us in post on social media), or as they call it in Lisbon the Tejo. At this point it is more like an inland bay. The channel which heads out west from here is wide enough, the massive suspension bridge shows that, but here it is more like being at the coast with it being the sea between you and another country. But it isn’t, that is still Portugal out over the other side of the expanse.
The sun is shining, it is a leisurely late Sunday afternoon and so we stroll along the banks of the river following the sun in going to the west, looking for somewhere to get refreshment. There are stalls along the front. The trend would very much appear to be to pina coladas served in hollowed out pineapples. A bar has a DJ playing next to the water, and in yet another square there is a live band playing traditional Portuguese music.
We find a café on the waterfront near the ferry port (for crossing the inland bay to the cities on the south of the river) in the sun and have drinks. The coffee looks amazing and tasted even better.
It is relaxing watching the people and the variety of boats going by.
We like it so much we stop there to have food. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a menu where one of the dishes have proclaimed themselves as being spiritual, but there on the menu is Spiritual Cod, which Helen ended up ordering.
It didn’t come with enlightenment or a prayer book, just in a dish looking like it was Cod Mornay.
Whilst sat outside the restaurant, another couple on the end table tried to spirit themselves away without paying, but the eagle-eyed staff noticed and ran after them, card machine in hand and got them to cough up what they had tried to avoid paying.
The sun is all but gone by the time we move on. We find we are close to the Time Out Market, so we have a wander through it to have a look. It is full and buzzy with lots of food options and certainly somewhere to think about coming back to on another evening.
We are now heading in the vague direction of the hotel. There are more squares. Buildings are being lit up. There are lots of interesting vehicles trying to entice tourists in for tours. And there are more steep uphill roads to walk up. That is the thing with guidebook maps. They show the roads and the direction they go in, but there is no mention or indication of the elevation of said roads.
After going up for what seems like a long time, we find ourselves at the top of the route of a different funicular. A quick check shows it goes down to the main drag we have walked along from the hotel earlier in the day, so we hop on.
We did know we had been going uphill for quite some time since leaving the banks of the river, but it is a surprise just how far we had climbed as the funicular ride down took a lot longer than we had imagined it would, and than the earlier one had.
When we had been going in the opposite direction earlier, the side of the road we walk along now had been full of market stalls, but they have all packed up and gone, only to leave behind the occasional café or restaurant which had been disguised by the surrounding stalls earlier.
There are lots of billboards up around the city as there had been when we were in Budapest, as there are elections on the way. I know it isn’t the correct interpretation, but I’m not sure I would be voting for someone with a slogan of Zero Future.
What had been intended to be a quick mooch about became six hours. Six very enjoyable hours, but now bed, and rest is calling us as there will be a lot more hours, so much more to see, and difficult food choices to be made for the next four days to come.

Of course, Hybrid Work is not only a campaign to us. Therefore, we want to introduce you to our colleagues that work from everywhere as digital nomads for diconium. Read further to see how Verena experienced her workation in beautiful Lisbon.
“Oh, you worked from Lisbon?” That was a common response to my explanation that I didn’t take a six-month sabbatical in Portugal, but simply moved the home office to the sun.
But back to the beginning: in October 2021, I took my first workation. Two weeks in Portugal — first Lisbon, then Porto — together with my colleague Lena. And that’s when a thought came up: Why not just stay longer? No sooner said than done. At the end of February 2022, it was time: I said goodbye to Stuttgart and boarded a plane heading south. Looking forward to warm spring days, lots of sun and much better weather than in Germany. Nice dream. It may sound surprising, but it also rains in Lisbon. A lot. Until April. But hey, somehow it was still nice to spend this “April weather” somewhere else.

Why Lisbon, you might ask yourselves? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city where you can find everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses, a thriving nightlife, the most beautiful beaches within reach, good restaurants and cafes, relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life. Oh yes, of course we also have an office there. Little has changed in my day-to-day work. The same projects, the same colleagues, even before mostly remote — now I just had to get up an hour earlier. But it still felt easier.
“Why Lisbon, actually? Simple answer: it’s Lisbon. A city that has everything: beautiful streets and alleys, colorful houses…relaxed people and that positive attitude towards life.”
The positive attitude towards life and the joy that this city carries also has a positive effect on my work. I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days. Lisbon simply invites you to leave the house also later in the evening, because there is so much to discover and see. And bang — it’s the weekend again. And in good Portuguese style, you simply enjoy it on the beach. You don’t need a vacation for that, it’s just a normal Saturday. Crazy, isn’t it?
“I felt more balanced and experienced a lot despite long working days.”
But I want to share something else: The biggest learning for me was how much I miss the physical meetings with my colleagues (even though I can’t count on one hand how many of them made a trip to Lisbon during my stay). Especially after things became a bit more open and dynamic again after two years remote work, I felt like I was stuck in the pandemic for even longer in my daily work life in Lisbon. Although I visited the Lisbon office, I did not meet my colleagues I’m directly working with. Therefore, every visit I made to our offices in Germany during this time showed me again how valuable these face to face interactions are — both on a human level and for the project progress. Just locking yourself and your team in a room for half a day helps move the project forward. And honestly? As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues again regularly.
“As much as I miss Lisbon, the sun, the warm weather, the sea and the surfboard — I really enjoy spending days in the office with my colleagues regularly.”
Don’t get me wrong, there’s something about sitting in a café on the beach and working from there — provided the internet connection is stable and the noise level is kept in check. Big shoutout to Teams for providing virtual backgrounds! That’s why I’m already very excited about where I’ll be going next and for how long. Because there is no doubt that I’ll be on another Workation. But in the end it is always nice to come back home.

In my previous article for Live View, I discussed the cameras I decided to bring along on a trip my wife and I planned for six months or more. The trip would start from Lisbon, voyage briefly to Tangiers, and then cruise along the coast of Andalusia to Barcelona. I wanted to travel light but be prepared to do justice to the places I would be seeing for the first, and possibly only, time.
Now we are in the midst of that trip. This article is a report on how things have worked out so far for me and my photography, as illustrated by what I saw in Lisbon.
To recap, I brought two cameras, my OM Systems OM-1 and my new Fuji X100VI. For the OM-1, I took two lenses — the 12–100mm F/4 and the 8–25mm F/4. At the last minute, I decided to take my 18mm conversion lens for the X100VI, and I’m glad I did. I originally thought that the OM-1 would be fine for all focal lengths, but it turns out that the X100VI with the wide conversion lens is great for small city streets.
Which I used more. On various tours over three days, including dark interiors and bright streets, I used whichever camera seemed appropriate — I carried both. Counting the results, it turns out I used both cameras equally. Six hundred thirty images with the Fuji, 680 for the OM.
When it came to focal lengths, it turns out I used the Fuji with the wide converter 56% of the time —…

Going down for breakfast we were able to get what looked to be the last two free seats in the restaurant. I’m looking down the room thinking it is rammed and being surprised as it wouldn’t appear the hotel is that big. But there is a mirror across the back of the room, so it looks twice the size with twice the people in it, and it was only my third wander around the room before I nearly walked into myself coming the other way and realised what was going on. (Have I said I’m not a morning person?)
I suppose it could be said I’m the weather jinx. The previous afternoon had been warm, so this morning I leave the hotel in shorts, t-shirt, and wearing sunglasses. So of course by the time we got on the first of the tour buses it was overcast and threatening to rain. If I said it was a little changeable during the day it might just about cover the number of times we changed seats, got undercover, back into the open, back undercover, in the open, downstairs, upstairs, downstairs, on and off.
When the sun did break through it was lovely and warm, but on the second of the three bus tour routes the spit spots turned into a torrential downpour, which coincided with exactly where we had planned to get off the bus and explore on foot.
As with many larger cities there are more than one route of HOHO buses in Lisbon. There are lots of places of interest to see, but they are spread out over a wide area, putting them all on one route would mean an exceedingly long bus tour.
We had decided on the blue route first which was more to the east and north of the city. Besides the grand municipal buildings and old churches it is interesting as to what catches the eye when on the tours. Such as the sex shop in a building with an Art Deco female fresco on the wall.
Or the Lisbon Business Centre being in a low rent run down block with ideas above its station.
The name of an ice cream store.
Or even the former gas storage frames.
The route goes through the part of the city which had regeneration for when Lisbon hosted Expo 1998. And there are some very interesting structures to see.
There is always too much to try and take in and with the speed of travel, or the angle you are at on the bus means that I spend a lot of time when back at home wondering what the hell I was trying to take a photo of.
What is not in any doubt is just how steeply undulating the city is. There are a lot of roads the buses go up which I’d not want to attempt driving a car, especially the angle of some of the red light induced hill starts which would be needed.
After a lap of the blue route, we change to the red route, getting part of the way around before the rain forced us downstairs for cover, fortunately picking seats which weren’t still getting leaked on down there. The viewpoint behind raindrop splattered windows is totally different and the opportunity to take photographs is limited. To zero.
We got off where we had planned to at the Jeronimos Monastery, supposedly where the first Pastel de Natas were ever made. It is in a traffic free zone (apart from the tour buses), and it is surrounded by museums. (And parts of the monastery buildings have been converted into museums.)
It is properly tipping it down and so we head into a packed Maritime Museum café for lunch. There are map related items to buy in the gift shop, without having to go into the museum, so always good. And whilst we had been lunching the rain had stopped and the sun was trying to escape the cloud cover.
Only for the rain to come back the moment we step outside. But we are used to rain, and we carry on and have a mooch about, through gardens, under the road and railway and to the riverbank and the immense Monument to the Discoveries on it.
In front of it in the square is a map of the world and on it are places highlighted with dates of when the Portuguese empire arrived there during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries following the footsteps of its famed explorers Vasco de Gama and Ferdinand Magellan.
We are heading back under the road and rail when Helen feels someone close up behind her. There is a woman pawing at her backpack and saying, ‘sorry it was open.’ It most definitely wasn’t the woman was blatantly trying to rob Helen. Fortunately, the front pocket was only full of tissues, and her phone and purse were at the bottom of the main compartment buried under lots of other stuff like a jumper and scarf. But whilst checking there was nothing missing the woman and her sidekick had scuttled off as fast as they could and were nowhere to be seen when we were back up at street level. The would-be thief may have got fuck all, but it did shake Helen up and meant she was reluctant to use the backpack as a backpack for the rest of the day and was ultra wary about anyone being close behind her at all.
It began to brighten as we continued to wander around Belem, but we didn’t stop and pick the bus back up at the same point, instead we ended up walking back towards the large suspension bridge.
This meant a detour over a footbridge spanning the road and railway and out onto the roof of one of the MAAT buildings, giving a good view of the other older one.
And of the suspension bridge, built to look like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, it is painted in the same plum colour paint (which is the best colour to be seen in the fog), but is a bit shorter.
Behind it on the hill on the south of the river is the statue Christ the King, like a smaller version of Christ the Redeemer in Rio, more like Christ the Reduced. They do like a copy.
The bridge is called the April 25th Bridge, a nod to the 1974 revolution. It had been shrouded in mist when we had come past it on the bus earlier.
We walked back to under the bridge before reacquainting ourselves with the HOHO bus tours, retracing part of the route we had done before (downstairs in the dry at the time), and past the Belem tower.
Another shower forced us back undercover, and moving back out from the cover just happened to coincide with passing the Basilica, one of the more spectacular churches of the city, and I missed the chance to get a photo of it completely.
Before the loop was complete, we jumped off to change to the green route for a couple of stops to get us up the steep narrow winding streets to the castle. It is easy to see why this route uses a minibus. The route certainly makes me want to reiterate my reluctance to ever want to drive on these streets in a car.
The plan is to get to the castle so that we can catch the 5pm walking tour included with the HOHO tickets. Which we just about manage.
The tour guide in Guilherme, and he is from Brazil, and is doing the tour in English and Spanish, which just blows my mind as I can only just about manage the one language, and even that needs to be carried around in a bucket most of the time.
From the high point next to the castle entrance we have a slow meander down to the river stopping at key points to have things pointed out and for little pieces of the history of the city imparted to us.
One is at the statue of St Vincent (patron saint of the city),
And the viewpoint down from the plaza there, over the terracotta roofs to the river, and across to the church of St Vincent on another hill,
And the dome of the National Pantheon housed in a former church.
We pass a tree which looks like it roots have escaped from the soil and are on an acid trip induced adventure.
There is a quick poke inside the cathedral (which we are likely to return to later in the week).
And then it is down to the river side, stopping at the spiky house.
And finally into the Commerce Square in front of the grand arch, which we had passed through on our little stroll the evening before.
It was a good tour, lasting a lot longer than the advertised hour, and there was even a recommendation of a post tour restaurant for dinner. Which had massive portions of lovely food at reasonable prices. Such sized portions it was probably a good idea there was a walk back up to the hotel involved afterwards.
Those twelve hours had flown by. Time for rest and to get ready to do it all again tomorrow. More buses and a boat tour to come.

There are few things more iconic than leaving rainy London in search of sunnier skies — only to land in Portugal to find… more rain.
Welcome to Lisbon, land of seven hills, centuries of charm, and one of the soggiest weekends I’ve ever had. And somehow, it was still magical.
We arrived bright-eyed, hopeful, and wildly underdressed. The UK, of course, had decided to be 22°C and sunny that weekend, while Lisbon greeted us with a torrential downpour.
After squelching to our hotel, Portobay Liberdade, we regrouped and, now lightly towel-dried, swam our way to a nearby Italian spot (Il Basilico, I think?) for a bite. My travel companion’s trainers were instantly soaked, turning a casual stroll into a mission: Operation Waterproof Shoe Hunt.
Easier said than done. Lisbon’s got many things — views, wine, vintage tiles, but trainers shops? Not in a monsoon.
That first day? Honestly, a washout. But then, we stumbled into dinner. And let me tell you, it was a revelation.
After drying off from our soggy adventures, we chose to dine in our hotel that night at Bistro 6, and it was one of the most fantastic choices we made. The duck was remarkable: Crispy on the outside, tender and rich on the inside, with a wonderful depth of flavour present in every bite. It was so good that even in a city as full of culinary gems as Lisbon, we couldn’t resist going back for round two. I’m pretty sure I’ll be daydreaming about that plate for years to come.
By morning, we gave in to our fate. Lisbon was going to soak us, and we were going to like it. Jackets on, umbrellas up (luckily supplied by the hotel), optimism renewed.
First stop: the Mercado da Ribeira (aka Time Out Market Lisbon). Our first-ever Time Out Market and it set the bar high. It wasn’t your typical chaotic food court, instead, it felt like a well-curated space with an incredible variety of options. From fresh seafood and gourmet croquettes to decadent handmade chocolates, there was something for every craving. The place was organised yet vibrant, buzzing with energy.
If you’re new in town, it’s the perfect place to meet people: everyone sits together, it’s lively, communal, and thriving.
We grabbed a doughnut (incredible!!), a couple of coffees, then wandered through the traditional market tucked behind the main hall. Fishmongers shouting, locals shopping, fruit stacked high, there was a real sense of the city coming to life. We were completely captivated.
Next, we set off to see Lisbon Cathedral (Sé) and try our luck with Tram 28, Lisbon’s charmingly vintage and famously packed transit option. While we waited in the drizzle, we were approached by a charismatic Parisian tour guide, offering a covered tuk-tuk ride through the city.
Usually, we’d run from that kind of pitch, but he had a roof, plastic sides, and an irresistible charm. Reader, we climbed aboard.Best decision of the trip.
He took us through the seven hills of Lisbon, shared history with passion, pointed out hidden spots we’d never have found on our own, and gave us time to really enjoy the views, not just tick them off a list.
Oh, and at our very first miradouro (viewpoint), someone proposed right next to us. Cue tears. Lisbon, suddenly, wasn’t just rainy — it was romantic.
We ended the day at Praça do Comércio, where the weather finally gave us a break. Picture this: three grand golden-yellow façades on three sides…and then, nothing. Just open sky and the wide, rolling Tagus River, looking more like a calm ocean than a river. It was one of the most unexpectedly stunning squares I’ve ever stood in.
With a glass of wine in hand and the wind finally drying our coats, we toasted to Lisbon’s stubborn beauty.
Sunday morning brought us to Belém — land of custard tarts and monumental queues. Our attempt to visit Jerónimos Monastery failed (read: misunderstood the queue and were politely turned away), but fate had better plans: we headed early to Pastéis de Belém instead.And thank everything holy we did.
This place is a Lisbon legend. From the outside, it looks like a pleasant café. But inside? It’s a labyrinth of awning-covered rooms, waiters by the dozen, and pastries by the thousands. Somehow, we snagged a table.
Between the two of us, we ordered at least six pastries — custards, almond cakes, an orange thing I can’t explain — and two coffees. The bill? €10 total. I don’t know how. I don’t care. I would’ve paid triple.
We even brought some back to the UK with us. That’s how good they were.
We wandered through Alfama and Old Town Lisbon on our last day, taking in the steep streets, the tiled walls, the laundry flapping above us. If I can give you one travel tip for Lisbon, it’s this:
Do not come with a new hip. Or bad knees. Or any aversion to steep climbs.Lisbon is beautifully vertical. Like, mountain goat vertical. My poor mum (fresh from hip surgery) was a trooper, but fair warning: this city is cardio with a capital C.
So, was it the sun-soaked European weekend I imagined? No.Was it a glorious, rain-drenched, pastry-fueled, unexpectedly beguiling adventure? Absolutely.
Lisbon is a city that sneaks up on you. It’s tiled facades and rooftop views, ghost stories in ancient cathedrals, and secret tarts tucked in glass counters. It’s fascinating markets and quiet moments, and unexpected friendships with French tuk-tuk drivers.
It’s a city I’ll absolutely come back to, preferably with better footwear, a lighter raincoat, and the same appetite for surprises.

I love reading fiction, writing when the mood strikes, and pottering outside when the sun comes out. Love art, travel, and catching a West End show when I can.

Having been woken up by an unpleasant noise I hear every morning Monday through Friday, I peeked at the darkness still reluctant to get up and saw nothing but furniture shapes. This time, I was quite thrilled to kick off the day because in just a few hours I would walk the streets of a city I never thought I’d visit.
Fast forward a couple of hours, a few airport checks and check-ins and one transit flight and I was finally there. Oh yes, and my arm was sore from carrying a few suitcases (thanks to my girlfriend), with that feeling of exhaustion as if coming home after a whole day’s work and a mediocre meal and no leg space for a 190-cm guy which caused me to twist and turn in my seat. But that’s the economy class ticket benefit you don’t get anywhere else. It is the airport company’s fault but I do often get — “Well, why are you that tall?”
Other than these minor inconveniences, the flight was good. I was here. Stepping out of the plane and walking for a change was a true remedy. I heard a whispering “Thank you” from my back and knees as I was willowing towards an airport exit.
Outside, palm trees dwarfed every building around it as they stood proudly, defying gravity. Above, the clear sky was chasing away the dark clouds that gathered in the night to water the city. They knew Lisbon was awaiting guests. The air was quite refreshing and it filled my lungs with energy after every breath. Comparing it to the cold Belgrade air, which is best felt with the scarf wrapped around your mouth, was pointless. It was a true marathon to get to the destination, yet I was more than eager to get the tour started. I couldn’t wait to see what the city had to offer.
The spring sun was shining bright. It is one of those days where you take your jacket with you, but it is warm enough during the day and you don’t need it. If you sit down, you can feel the wind creeping up your shirt sleeves, giving you goosebumps. So with my jacket on and off and on and off again, I was strolling the old parts of Lisbon.
Each building, house and structure of any kind, whether historical or not was a story for itself thanks to the bright blue, yellowish and white tiles covering it. The tiles, called azulejos, were used as decoration, but also to protect the buildings from the salty river and ocean air. It is the first thing that catches the eye, together with different kinds of tiles laid under your feet. Those painted pictures of ships, seas, winds and other things on the squares, streets, and sidewalks.
Walking through the city street I was faced with the dilemma to look down and up, as vibrant colors were everywhere with tiles reflecting the sun, giving you the warm and cozy feeling of familiarity and admiration.
It took me a while to fight against the hilly terrain to get to what I consider to be the main square — Praca do Comercio. It offers a marvelous view of the Tagus river which shows its full power exactly at this place, pushing the coast to the sides, stretching out as much as possible. One might be tricked to consider this to be the sea, partly due to the pleasant breeze coming at you. However, it is just the spot where you can see the full power and potential of nature, as the river narrows down a bit further “down the road” before it collides with the vastness of the cold and blue Atlantic. Seagulls are flying around, their song mixing with the people murmur and tram’s racket.
A few tiny white sails were seen on the river, while across, the remaining parts of the city are calling you to explore them, with much more greenery and sparse buildings.
The welcoming atmosphere invites you to sit on the curb, even in one of the surrounding cafes and just soak in everything around you. And that’s what I did. The sounds, the smells the view. It is all one needs to know about a city to recognize its soul, and it didn’t take me long to see Lisbon as my own.
As the sun retreats, the tiredness due to miles of walking and exploring caught up with me again, but just like upon the arrival, it was mixed with pleasure and peace.
And the sunsets…true Lisbon colors show up, the ones you cannot see during the day. With the remains of the day, the rush is over and satisfaction is painted on every face you encounter, tourist or local.
Sleep catches with you quickly when you lie down. I cannot remember what happened, but it was morning again. And that awful alarm sound, although it felt better this time. Getting down to the hotel lobby by elevator felt a bit painful due to aching in my legs, yet there was no choice. The city was calling me out to turn every corner, see every tile and smell the air from hills and valleys.
Alfama is a city within a city. I decided to walk across it and it was a mistake from the start. Uphill and downhill terrain made this area specific, with no flat parts. To me, it all seemed uphill, especially after a few hours. Luckily, you can get on the vintage yellow tram which is one of the symbols of the city and ride up, before you get off and walk uphill. Again. Endless elevation. And just like the other areas, Alfama is colorful and vibrant but there’s something special about it, something mysterious that I couldn’t define.
My stomach started complaining, which meant that the entire itinerary changed and the first place I wanted to get to was the restaurant. Suddenly, all those historical places became “meh” as human biology stepped in.
Lisbon is a perfect city for fish lovers. Fish is all over the menus and all I desired at that point was salmon — and boy, oh boy, it was terrific. Add a squeeze of lemon on top of it, with a fresh salad as the side dish and it is a perfect combination. No bones to pick just a light yet fulfilling meal.
While all of that was happening, a fado trio was playing the background, a local band, performing here and there, and it was all that was missing. They hit the right note as the sun was setting over Alfama.
The moment I landed at the Belgrade airport, I was happy to be home, yet sadness filled my inner being. The city was grey and colorless, with people rushing all over the place, going in the wrong direction. It was cold outside and the cold reached all the way to my bones. I already missed the sunny hillsides and building tops, the uneven grounds and the atmosphere which seemed to be more welcoming.
I was back in my everyday routine. Yet, on every cloudy and misty day, I remember the Lisbon sun, shining bright!
Until we meet again!

With the sun beating down on me and a temperature of over 28°C, I see a fellow runner lying on the curb being attended to by first responders. I check my watch and decide to stop once again at the next water station. This is going to be much tougher than I expected…
My journey to the 2017 Lisbon Marathon started in the winter of 2015. I was busy assembling IKEA furniture when I was struck by a burning pain in my knee that refused to go away. For the next few days it continued to get worse and every small stair suddenly became a major challenge. Finally, I decided to see an orthopedist. I never really liked (or had much reason) to see a doctor, but I had just turned 45, my girlfriend Anna was pregnant with our daughter and I figured getting it checked out would be the responsible thing to do.
The visit ended with a referral for an MRI that led to a nasty surprise. The cartilage in my knees was considerably damaged. These injuries had been looming for some time as I continued to ignore the warning signs. The diagnosis was clear. I would now be required to get a sodium hyaluronate injection directly into my knee joints every 6 months just to ease the pain. An injection with a price tag of $750 that isn’t covered by any health insurance. To add insult to injury, the doctor casually said, “Look, you may be able to go for a 5-kilometer jog, and you should do that regularly, but nothing longer. Take it easy, you will never be able to run a marathon, so don’t bother trying.” These comments resonated in me for a long time. I never even considered running a marathon — until this very moment.
I have always seen myself as a member of the running community, but frankly, my laps through the park had become less frequent over the years. There was the occasional spring onset of daily runs that lasted for about a month, but they were never farther than 5 to 10k. The longest distance I had ever run was a 25k race but that was only once and it was over 20 years ago. So, I could have been content with injections twice a year and back to a rather normal life. Only that I wasn’t.
The most urgent issue I wanted to focus on was the pain. I started reading a lot about treatment options and I decided to try something other than getting needles jammed into my knees. After a bit of experimentation, I found that taking a high dose daily (2000 mg) of glucosamine sulphate was starting to help me. Later, I added omega 3 and collagen to the mix. After a couple of weeks the burning sensation went away. I had indeed found an alternative for my battered knees.
Please bear with me, in one of my former lives I was also a lawyer: This is what worked for me, but no medical advice whatsoever is intended.
The following year I wasn’t really prioritizing my running career. Throughout all of 2016, I covered a total distance of less than 60 km in twelve runs. Yes, I had a lot of other things on my plate, with a newborn baby, being CEO of Berlin’s Innovation Agency and everything else. At least I was sticking to the doctor’s advice when it came to the part of “taking things easy” with my knees. But I had a growing sense that I was missing something. I was somehow able to manage getting everything done — but I was also realizing that I was losing my edge.
New Year’s Eve is always a great time for resolutions. In the years past, I must admit (and you can probably relate), these intentions were rather short-lived. But this time I was hell-bent to make a change for real. So I came up with something that seemed utterly beyond reach: For 2017 I resolved to run a marathon. And to make things more interesting, I didn’t even consider the Berlin Marathon in my hometown. I was looking for a venue with added value. I soon found Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, located at the River Tagus and the Atlantic Ocean, one of the most fascinating cities in Europe. With the race scheduled for October 15th, this would leave me enough time to find out if my knees would keep up with my ambitions.
The first thing I did was to read about marathon training. There are many manuals and programs out there. The takeaway lesson was: Run frequently, consistently including workouts for speed, stamina, and mobility and run a reasonable number of longer runs that should include a 30+ km run in the weeks before the event. This means you must spend a lot of time and you must spend it regularly. Marathon training is an exercise in discipline and commitment, that much I realized. Wait, I only had time for two handfuls of recreational runs in 2016 and (what I thought to be) insufficient sleep due to our baby’s somewhat erratic sleep patterns, a demanding job and, last but not least, a relationship to cherish. Sounds like something straight from the playbook of Mission Impossible, doesn’t it?
Nevertheless, I came up with a plan. I set 2 milestones that would serve as my intermediate goals: The 10k City Night race in Berlin on July 29th along the famous Kurfürstendamm Boulevard and the Stadtlauf Berlin half marathon on August 20th. If I could complete both within a reasonable time and my knees would be functional afterwards I would book the flights to Lisbon. After registering for both races, I started running 5 kilometers on January 3rd along the icy shores of Schlachtensee Lake, which would become my favorite route for the next couple of months.
With the marathon still in the “distant” future, the winter runs that followed were a bit sporadic. Eventually I had to figure out how to fit my training into my daily routine and the only solution I came up with was to get up early. And I mean really early, at 4:30 am.
There has been a lot written about the benefits of starting your day off early and I must say, it’s totally true! Starting your work day after you have spent some time working out is great. Having a daily sense of achievement after logging 10 or 20 km before you start breakfast is truly awesome. Having the chance to focus on your thoughts while enjoying the sunrise is priceless. So, over the next few months, I was running regularly and enjoying the slow and steady progress I was making.
Both tests I recklessly scheduled quite close to the big day went well, so I booked the flights and a very nice apartment in Lisbon’s historic Alfama district. Finally, it was going to happen. I would run at the Lisbon Marathon!
In the final week before the race one issue became increasingly pressing — the weather forecast. When I had the idea of flying to Portugal for my first ever marathon, I of course checked the weather information. On average you can expect 20°C in the middle of October. But not this year, the forecast was 31°C with clear skies. The 2006 Chicago Marathon had to be shut down with the mercury at 28°C but I expected that in sunny Portugal this wouldn’t even be considered. So, I frantically worked on adapting my gear. It is a good thing that you reduce your training miles leading up to the race (a.k.a. tapering), so you can take care of these kinds of things.
However, speaking of reduced miles, another question started nagging me. Did I train enough? Even though I ran nearly every day in the weeks prior to Lisbon, I never ran a distance longer than 25 km. But on the other hand, 15 km was one of my regular morning runs, so the additional stretch should be manageable, right? Since there was no chance I could redo my training plan in the next few days, I decided to relax. The race day would prove if my reasoning was right.
I arrived Thursday evening in Lisbon to acclimate myself and focus on the challenge ahead. It was a luxury to have time to think and I enjoyed doing so at the marathon’s designated finish at Praça do Comércio. Here, you have a wonderful view over River Tagus’ final passage before joining the Atlantic Ocean. It became my “vision quest” as my girlfriend Anna would call it. She has always been supportive of my aspirations. Although we originally planned to make the trip to Lisbon together, Anna decided to stay at home with our young daughter and this gave me the gift of time alone. I used it well and came up with a list of goals and dreams for my future.
Finally, the day of the race dawned and I was sitting on the train from Lisbon to Cascais jammed with marathoners in various degrees of contemplation. Some were sitting on the floor with an empty look on their face, others were chatting happily away with their running buddies or texting home. I was silently rehearsing my game plan: Stick to the well-trained pace of 5:30, don’t get carried away by competing with other runners in the first 20 or so km, pick up the pace at 30 km aiming at a negative split, finish sub 4:00 hours.
And I stuck to the plan, at least for the first 20 km. After crossing the starting line in a wave of euphoria I was soon running steadily. I found the waving flag of the 4 hour pacemaker I was going to follow until the half marathon mark and the first misting station was in sight.
Then something unexpected happened. The heart rate display on my watch jumped to an unreal 202 bpm and I forced myself to slow down. Around 175 bpm would have been the “normal” maximum for a person of my age. Today, looking back at the data, I’m sure that this reading was erroneous because I have never again gone over a 170 bpm. At the time, I only had the information on my display and it had a tremendous impact. I suddenly realized that I still had another half marathon to go and the sun was beating down mercilessly even though it wasn’t even 10 a.m. yet. I checked my knees for any signs of pain or weakness. Had I overestimated myself? How could I have believed that with only months of training I would be able to pull this off? I already envisioned myself collapsing at the roundabout near the beach of Carcavelos.
This was the point where I was (to be honest for the first time really) awestruck by the magnitude of the marathon as a test of body and mind. I considered my options. I could stop now and justify it with the parching heat and my staggering heart rate. But in the end, I decided to follow through, no matter what. My goal had changed. Certainly, I still wanted to finish with a time that would be to the best of my abilities, but I mainly focused on not being defeated. I would slow down, I would drink whenever possible, I would even walk any uphill stretches of the course. The reason I started this endeavor in the first place was to prove to myself that it was still possible to accomplish something really demanding and to push my limits. This would become my mantra for the next kilometers to come.
And those kilometers weren’t easy. In fact, I never experience the famous “runner’s high”, at least not while I was running. The last 10 km became an uncomfortable rhythm of moving along an agonizing 2.5 km stretch only to reach the next water station, drinking and cooling myself, and starting all over again, but it worked. After I had passed the 40 km mark the number of cheering spectators increased significantly. That gave me the final boost to give the backup goal I cooked up with while poking along the torrid Avenida Marginal a try: Finishing at 4:30.
With a final sprint I reached the finish line at 4:30:54!
After hitting the stop button on my sports watch I felt exhausted but otherwise amazingly good. No cramps, no sore muscles even in the days following the race. Interestingly enough, the knees that brought me there also carried me throughout the whole distance without any problems. So, on a physiological level, it is safe to say that the stress I put on my body was easily absorbed.
The marathon had both a short and long term impact on my psychology as well. It all started with the continuous effort I put into my training despite all the seemingly “good” reasons why there wasn’t enough time. Once I made up my mind and committed myself to the marathon, I magically found ways to make it happen. I was able to build up my knees by training and through supplements with no side effects based on the research I did. I was able to regain my confidence and mental strength on a very fundamental level. And I was able to apply all of this to master the challenge the Lisbon Marathon turned out to be.
After I had taken a cold shower in my apartment and devoured a carb-laden lunch, I immediately went back onto the streets of Lisbon for a walk. I noticed a shift in my perspective that is still present today. A lot of things suddenly felt shallow and dispensable, others became much more significant, like sharpening the focus of my mental map. And I started working towards reaching some of the most important goals that I had identified just days before.
So, it once again proves to be true: Every cloud has a silver lining. When I got the news of my supposedly ruined knees, it seemed to be the end of my running days. But instead, this was just the beginning! It has forced me to make decisions about how I want to live my life. I opted for the challenges and that has allowed me to grow beyond my athletic ambitions. You gain nothing by accepting your fate, you must keep on fighting if you want to win.

Lisbon is a city of seven hills. And I am the queen of one of them, for three days. But if I go down a hill, I must climb up again.
The charm of Lisbon is its narrow lanes and endless steps lined by colorful azulejos (tile) covered buildings. The beauty of Lisbon is its hills and plentiful viewpoints with panoramic views. To climb these hills, you’d need good food to fuel your stamina. The good news is, delicious food is everywhere for every budget.
Since we had been to Lisbon once many years ago, this time we decided not to cram a tourist checklist into our three-day stay.
We were first captivated by the sweeping view from Miradouro de Santa Catarina (Viewpoint of Saint Catarina), within a short walk from where we are staying. The grand Tagus River and the red tile roofs beneath glow in the warm sun, and Christ the King statue stands tall in the distance across the river. Both locals and tourists enjoy having a drink at Noobai rooftop bar and restaurant. We didn’t have a chance to catch the sunset there but it is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view. There is also…

When I was first thinking about moving to Germany, the appeal was pretty clear: Germany is an economic powerhouse, one of the strongest economies in the world. I thought to myself, “Okay, if I move there, I’m making a smart decision for my career.” And even though Berlin wasn’t exactly my first choice, I figured it would work as a starting point.
Fast forward six years, and I’m feeling stuck both personally and professionally and I’m starting to question the environment I’m in.
Feeling stuck? I wrote about why settling in one place can actually be dangerous for your growth. If you’re curious, check it out here: Why Settling in One Place Can Be Dangerous for Your Growth.
But, let’s get to the real reason I’m writing this post: Lisbon.
I recently visited Lisbon for the first time, and let me tell you, I was shocked in the best way possible, I was still taken aback by how much I loved it.
The streets were clean, the infrastructure was solid, and public transportation actually worked well enough to make getting around a breeze. But what really stood out to me was the overall vibe of the city. It just felt… ordered.
There was this balance of modernity and tradition, Lisbon had this richness that Berlin doesn’t always capture, at least not in the same way. It’s not just in the food and the gorgeous architecture, but in the way the city feels. The people were welcoming, the atmosphere felt peaceful and grounded — everything just felt a little… livable.
The streets didn’t feel unsafe or disorderly, and I didn’t have to dodge random bottles or step over anything unpleasant. It felt clean — and not just physically, but in terms of its overall atmosphere. Lisbon felt way more laid-back and balanced — a place where I could actually imagine calling home.
On my way back to Berlin I find myself wondering… could Lisbon be the place for me? Maybe it’s time to seriously think about it. But … As much as I’ve dreamt about moving to Lisbon, my hopes have taken a bit of a hit.
Lisbon used to have a reputation for being more affordable than other European capitals, but the reality is, rent prices have been climbing steadily — especially in the trendy neighborhoods — bringing them in line with cities like Berlin!
On top of that, salaries in Lisbon are still pretty low compared to other European cities, so the cost of living isn’t as balanced as I once thought. It’s a bummer, but looks like my dream of settling in Lisbon it didn’t last too long!
So here I am again, chasing the original plan moving to Munich. Although is one of the most expensive places to live in Germany, at least the salaries are around 30% higher than what I’ve been offered in Berlin!
But even with the potential for a bigger paycheck, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just stuck in this loop of chasing after cities that are becoming increasingly expensive while the job market still feels a bit of a mirage!
The whole “Germany has tons of job opportunities” narrative is, well, not exactly the truth. Anyone who’s actually lives here knows how tough it can be to land a job, even if you speak German at a C2 level. The competition is fierce, and sometimes it feels like it doesn’t matter how qualified you are.
Sure, the western and the southern part of Germany is still financially doing well, but if the job hunt keeps feeling this grim, it might just be time to explore other options. It’s a tough decision, but I’m honestly getting a little tired of hitting dead ends. I’m even starting to entertain the idea of leaving the country altogether.
Sadly, Lisbon will remain in my heart as a city that surprised me and gave me some amazing daydreams of a life where I could see smiles around and feel a sense of calm in the everyday. It’s the kind of place that makes you think, “This could be home,” but sometimes, reality just doesn’t align with those dreams.
I’m thinking about where to go next. I’ve got some exciting options on my mind, if you’re curious, check it out here: I’m Leaving Berlin. Let me know your thoughts!

Shannon is behind one of Lisbon’s coolest coding school: Le Wagon. We met at Beta-i and got curious to know more about her story and how you start such a project from scratch without being from the city yourself. Time for some questions!
I moved here four years ago to be with my boyfriend who is from Lisbon. I never imagined at that time that I would still be here four years on, but the city has been changing (for the good) at such an alarming rate in the last few years that I feel like I moved somewhere new.
Rather than why I came to live here, the better question is why I stayed. And to answer that, you can read a blog post I published a few weeks ago on Le Wagon — Why would you relocate to Lisbon?
www.lewagon.com
Le Wagon is a code school for non-technical entrepreneurs and creatives. We give people the programming and product development mindset through teaching ruby on rails web development.
My motivation to launch Le Wagon started two years ago while I was working in a local accelerator/ incubator here in Lisbon. I saw a lack of technical talent amongst the founders and also felt that I could benefit myself from understanding on a basic level what is going on behind the scenes of software.
Now, after having gone through the program myself and already running three 9 week batches in Lisbon, I can say I know that and a whole lot more, plus have 60+ Lisbon alumni as a support when it comes to launching my own products and finding cool jobs in the tech market.
Growing very quickly with a very diverse mix of internationals and locals.
We really wanted to be immersed in Lisbon’s startup ecosystem and Beta-i was a great way to access this community.
We could do a better job of this to be honest. At the moment, we are cross promoting events and of course enjoying some impromptu beers on the roof :)
Learning how to learn (again) — their EGOS! As humans, we are conditioned to shy away from challenge. We want all the glory with all the ease. We tend to work in areas and take on tasks that make us feel good. The first three weeks of Le Wagon are an ice cold shower for those that are not accustomed to just not getting something in the beginning. You really have to have faith in yourself and our curriculum when you start the program. The concepts are abstract for most people and they need to time sink in. Le Wagon is like learning to ride a bike. You have to be willing to keep getting on the bike and falling off and trust that eventually if you do that enough times, it will click and you’ll start riding.
To keep the students believing in themselves and their ability. To keep “falling off the bike”.
In our first batch, we had a student that really struggled. And when I say struggled, there were days he didn’t finish a challenge. But the guy had a great attitude. He didn’t give up. He didn’t compare himself to his classmates. He just kept going. After the bootcamp, he was one of the first to get a job and not even in ruby — in Javascript on the backend! He is our mascot here in Lisbon on what it means to give it your all.
Our community is growing locally. We expect in the next year to have our own space with our own cowering for our alumni and ruby on rails developers.
Thanks Shannon for your time and insights!

By Casey Paxton
Here at Salsify, we can’t stop talking about our brand spankin’ new office and team in Lisbon, Portugal! We do love Boston, but nothing can top the beautiful sunny weather and gorgeous beaches of Lisbon. I recently got the chance to sit down with our People Operations Specialist in Portugal, Marta Carvalho, to get her take on Lisbon, Boston, and all things Salsify!
Q: So, what exactly does a People Operations Specialist do?
A: As a part of the People Ops team, it’s my responsibility to promote employee engagement and brand awareness, onboard new hires, support HR processes, team building, and a lot of other fun stuff! Since we are just getting started in Lisbon, my current work is very focused on building and growing the Lisbon team, and ramping up the Salsify employment brand in Lisbon.
Q: How long have you been working for Salsify?
A: A little over one month.
Q: How did you find out about Salsify?
A: I heard about Salsify coming to Lisbon through networking in the Lisbon tech community.
Q: What made you want to work for Salsify?
A: The opportunity to do what I really love in a company with great culture and values. It’s great to be part of this project since the beginning. Plus, I have the opportunity to be a pioneering person in HR and to think, implement, and see through the best policies and procedures!
Q: What is it like working for Salsify versus working for a Portuguese company?
A: For me, the possibility of traveling and working in collaboration with Boston colleagues on a daily basis is something that I really love. Plus, Portuguese companies tend to have long and inconclusive personal meetings! I’ve been struggling a lot with this in my last years :) I’m delighted that things at Salsify are done promptly, on time, and focus on specific goals. I feel that people here are very productive and efficient.
Q: What is the biggest cultural difference that you’ve encountered between Portugal and the United States?
A: Well . . . you all seem to have lunch and dinner pretty early :) I’m used to having dinner by 9 pm for instance while in Boston, it was super common to have dinner by 6 pm. It feels like days and nights in Portugal take longer.
Q: What has been your favorite and least favorite thing about working for Salsify so far?
A: Favorite thing is probably the possibility to work with such a great and friendly team. Least favorite thing is the current temporary office, which is about to change when we move to a new office full of windows and sunshine!
(We actually just moved to our new office! Check it out here.)
Q: Are you someone who can listen to music while you work?
A: Only during some tasks. If I’m doing some sourcing or replying to some emails, then yes. If I need to think about something more strategic or write down policies and procedures, I can’t.
Q: Where in the world would you most like to travel?
A: There are so many places I would like to go that it’s hard to pick out only one. I love sun and beaches, so anything that seems like a paradise are good destinations (Hawaii, Bahamas, Bali…).
Q: Do you have a hidden talent/fact that most people don’t know about you?
A: Well, I dance a lot of Salsa and Bachata. I’m not sure if it is a talent, but it’s something I love to do and I know how to do it.
Q: Tea or coffee?
A: Coffee for sure. Not a fan of tea, only drink it when I’m sick. Tea does not bring me good memories :)
Q: Reading or watching TV?
A: Both. Love to see a good movie or also to do some binge watching on Netflix. However, also love to take a book to Starbucks (yes, Starbucks is very appreciated in Lisbon!) or a nice coffee shop and read it on a rainy day.
Q: What is your favorite thing about Lisbon?
A: What keeps me in Lisbon is definitely being close to my family. Also, our sunny days, good food, and great sights to see make me love Lisbon. What I like the most is the possibility to go to the beach in fifteen minutes from my home! Even in winter, the sun stills shines here and you can have a good time on a nice terrace on the beach.
Q: Best lunch spot in Lisbon?
A: There are so many. Food in Lisbon is the best. I like to go to Portugalia, in Belem (but more because of the space rather than the food).Q: You recently visited the Boston office! Was this your first time in Boston? How did you like it?
A: Just loved it! It was my first time in the US and I was delighted. The first few days were pretty tough. Never felt so much cold in my entire life! But I loved to see the city with and without the snow. You have a beautiful city and compared to Lisbon, everything is so big. I felt very welcome by the whole team and got really impressed about how big we are in Boston. Looking forward to create something similar in Lisbon.
Q: What are you most excited about moving forward?
A: I love the creation processes of everything. So, very excited about creating the Lisbon Team and to set all things for the creation of our offices as well.
Obrigado, Marta, for letting us get to know you and Portugal a bit better! Check out our careers page for more info about all of our amazing job openings, and be sure to follow us on Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter for all the Salsify updates you could ever want.

Haven’t joined Medium yet but still want to read my story? Fine. Click Here
This was a museum that caught my eye when we did our ‘buzz through’ visit to Lisbon in February. Portugal has a centuries long maritime tradition for exploration, military and commercial enterprise and since world history is a subject I’m a little interested in, I put it on the list.
We came back to Lisbon near the end of March and after quite a little bit of ‘what do we want to see?’ conversation, we purchased the 72 hour Lisboa Pass which offers free or discounted admission to dozens of attractions.
Located in the Belém district, home to an amazing number of interesting attractions, Museu de Marinha, also known as the Maritime Museum or the Navy museum, is on the list with a 20% discount. So, instead of 7€ (US$7.65 at the time) we were admitted for only US$6.13 each.
The museum is located in one end of the Jerónimos Monastery building, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which is an attraction on its own. One we didn’t visit, BTW.

Let me tell you a story. This one takes us to Lisbon, Portugal, where I went to visit someone who has been my fairy godmother and her amazing husband. To protect her privacy, let’s call her “Ballerina.”
Now, Lisbon was everything you’d imagine, great people, great food, and endless opportunities to learn. Between physics, entropy, mountains, ballet, and Portuguese culture, my mind was buzzing. But, as always, the universe had a peculiar surprise in store for me. You see, Ballerina has this friend, Karma, who happens to be a Tibetan Buddhist Kempo monk. Yes, his name is as amazing as his wisdom. One day, we decided to head to the beach for some sun and sea after I met with folks from the World Bank to brainstorm ways to tackle water scarcity. Pretty typical day, right?
Well, here’s the twist: monks don’t usually carry swim trunks. So, what do you do when your monk friend wants to dip his toes in the ocean? You go and buy him a pink swimsuit, of course. Armed with this purchase, we made our way to the water, chatting about life, music, and whatever else crossed our minds. Turns out, Karma had spent some time in Mexico and spoke Spanish. This led us down a hilarious rabbit hole of Latin music, culminating in a spontaneous rendition of *Despacito*. There we were, a cosmologist, a Buddhist monk, and a theoretical physics PhD student, on a Portuguese beach, singing and dancing to a reggaeton hit. Life’s surreal moments, I tell you.
But wait, there’s more. I’m not exactly an ocean person. I grew up in the Andes, far from any sea, and I didn’t realize how quickly the water could chill me. As the sun set, my body temperature dropped fast, too fast. Ballerina, who, by the way, is not just an award-winning cosmologist and a ballerina but also a seasoned mountaineer, immediately noticed something was off. Her mountaineering instincts kicked in, and she got me out of the water before I turned into a human popsicle. After almost giving her a heart attack with my near-hypothermic state, we bundled me up and made it back home safe.
That trip wasn’t just about beaches, physics, or even *Despacito*. It was about being in the company of some of the most brilliant and fascinating minds I’ve ever met. Karma, in particular, taught me so much about the art of controlling the mind, meditating, and navigating emotions with clarity. It was like a crash course in mastering the internal chaos we all carry.
But more than anything, this trip reminded me of the simple joy in life’s beautiful chaos. The cliff, the mountains, the black cat, the dreams, the tree, the hedgehogs, the sunset, each a little piece of the puzzle. Between deep conversations, fresh ideas, and hours spent playing with their incredible kids, I felt myself rediscovering the wild, curious, and playful side of me. It’s the part that often gets buried under all the equations and theories, but it’s always there, waiting to come alive again.
Life’s better when it surprises you, isn’t it?

It was a nightmare to leave the “Estação Oriente” in Lisbon.
After spending a delightful few days in Porto, I boarded the AP train, eager to return to Lisbon.
The trip took me 3 good hours that I spent writing and communicating with my laptop. The train wifi was working properly.
However, as I arrived at the Lisbon train station (Aug 5), I found myself in an unexpected predicament.
The bustling station was packed with an ocean of people from all corners of the globe, and a wave of claustrophobia washed over me.
I felt in some ways lost and unsure of how to reach my hotel via the subway train.
Navigating through the sea of travelers proved to be a daunting task.
Each person seemed to be in a hurry, and it felt like the entire world had gathered in Lisbon to witness a momentous event — the Pope.
Feeling overwhelmed, I took a moment to compose myself and tried to spot any sign or direction for the subway.
However, it was not easy amidst the crowd. And every escalator was not working.

Two black socks hang from plastic clips above the Travessa da Cruz do Torel, an alleyway in Lisbon. I cut through the Jardim do Torel on the way to my favorite park. Yet I’ve never been this way, turning right instead of left when exiting the garden.
I lean upon the golden wall, taking in the details of the surroundings. Slanting shadows carry shade and slice the buildings into softer, darker tones.
High above the buildings, above the wire and the socks, sits the pale, subdued moon. I can’t fathom what it is — what it physically is — dust, rock, an assortment of matter. What I see, perhaps, isn’t dust drifting into darkness; I see something like a stone, patiently waiting to shine.
I can conceptualize a stone. When I look into the sky, it’s like a rock beneath a moving river; is that not what it is?
Later it’ll change, morph into a sphere of light, glistening from afar.
Its emergence means that night is falling, and that feels good. I feel the change of weather, the chilling of the breeze.

Three days in June
I went straight toward the Tagus River walking across the shopping. This is the ""Parque das Nações"", Lisbon.
Recently I made a trip by train from Porto to Lisbon.
The Alfa pendular comfort 1st class is easy and tranquil.
It takes almost 3 horas from Campanhã station in Porto to Oriente station in Lisbon.
The train has wifi you can work during the trip. I felt a little dizzy and had to stop my work.
When arriving in the city… the Orient station is connected to the Vasco da Gama shopping mall and the metro station.
If you take the subway the first thing anyone will notice is the art poetry and murals of the metro stations. They inspire people all day long.
On the wall written in Portuguese on blue azulejos (tile art)…
""A verdade que eu conto, nua e pura vence toda grandiloca escritura."" Luis de Camões, Os Luziadas.

Nestled along the banks of the Tagus River in Lisbon’s vibrant Parque das Nações district is the Vasco da Gama Tower, an architectural gem that marries Portugal’s rich maritime heritage with contemporary design.
Rising to 145 meters (476 feet), it is the tallest structure in Portugal and a symbol of the city’s forward-looking spirit.
Named after the famed Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the first European to reach India by sea, the tower embodies the adventurous spirit that propelled Portugal to the forefront of the Age of Discoveries.
Its design is inspired by the billowing sails of a caravel, the iconic ship that carried explorers like da Gama to uncharted territories. This homage is not just in name but in the tower's silhouette against Lisbon’s skyline.
Designed by architects Leonor Janeiro and Nick Jacobs in collaboration with the engineering firm SOM (Skidmore, Owings & Merrill), the Vasco da Gama Tower was originally constructed for Expo ’98, the World’s Fair hosted by Lisbon in 1998.
The event commemorated the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama’s voyage to India and spurred significant urban development…

A new chapter. A new adventure.
Lisbon has slowly but surely won me over. It’s a city where I’ve decided to pause and settle for a while, despite the numerous considerations that influenced this decision. Now, I’m excited to share my journey in Lisbon, including my discoveries of its food, cafes, and various other delights.
This isn’t my first experience living abroad. Before Lisbon, I spent six years in Izmir, Türkiye, which was no small stint, especially since I moved there when I was just 18. Now, I’ve chosen to continue my journey in Lisbon, though the future might see me moving elsewhere or perhaps returning to my home country, Indonesia. For now, Lisbon is my home, and I can’t wait to explore and share its wonders.
Visiting Lisbon as a tourist, I found the city to be incredibly charming and lovely. However, by moving here made me realise how hill-y this city is! I arrived in September, at that time it was still pretty warm — maybe around 30+C, I was sweating all the time!
Surprisingly, I’ve adapted! I’ve learned to control my breathing, maintain a steady walking pace, and navigate the public transportation system, which has helped me avoid excessive walking and sweating — obviously 🤣. Now, I can truly appreciate all that Lisbon has to offer, both its beauty and its challenges.
Coming to Lisbon without knowing Portuguese has been surprisingly manageable, as most people here speak English. However, this convenience has made me a bit “lazy” about learning the language — I think I took it for granted somehow. Despite this, I’m starting to learn Portuguese, albeit slowly, and I’m doing my best to speak it as much as possible. Even though people in restaurants, cafes, and other places often ask me to speak in English instead, I appreciate their understanding of my struggle to even form a single sentence 🥹
Like many European countries, I don’t have particularly problems on finding Asian foods in Lisbon. There are some restaurants which are pretty good, however I am still in the mission finding the best ones here. Beside Asian cuisines, there are other lots of foods choices. I have my favourite bagel place, coffee (even the overpriced one 🤣☕️), and local food like Francesinha (I like this a lot!). I will make different writings about it — Lisbon food review!
Surprisingly, there is a big Asian supermarket here, quite close with the airport and decent pricing. Mostly products from China, but they have quite variable options from Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese. As I am Asian myself, having this HUGE supermarket is a blessing! 😇
There are foods that I am quite familiar here in Portugal which is pretty similar like in Indonesia, they have different fillings — like Risoles, Croquete, and some biscuits (like cat-tongue, etc).
So, food culture in Portugal is quite rich. I don’t think I ever have food shock here in extreme ways! Don’t worry if want to move or live here, your stomach will be fine and full too 🍽️
Diversity is a thing here in Lisbon, I think it is nice to have such a diverse community. People are surprisingly warm and friendly tho. According to the European Commission’s survey about Quality of life in European cities in 2023, 94% population agreed that the city is a good place to live in general. For me in general, Lisbon is a safe city. Obviously like another cities in the world, there are sketchy neighbourhoods and crimes, but I found in general is pretty safe. So far, I don’t have negative experiences here.
I think I’ve written quite a bit here, so I’ll wrap it up for now. There’s much more to share about Lisbon, so stay in touch! More stories to come. See you soon!

In February of 2016, I started a new experience in my life. I was cast as the leader of a team (a team of two, at the time, including myself, though having grown a lot more since then…) that would work with a US company.
Almost two years have passed since and now it’s time for a new challenge. It’s also time to reevaluate the time and experiences taken from it.
First things first. For the first few months, I will try to minimize any disruption as best as I can. In the beginning, I’m all about understanding everything that’s in and around the company. How they work, who the people are, and how they get along together. Understanding how they think helps me to adjust my discourse to something that would be more familiar to them, more inline with what they’ve come to expect so far.
I’m always careful with my first interactions. I have seen many times in my life people coming along and, in attempting to be helpful, start right away trying to fix any issues that may come their way. In my view, this approach, while sometimes needed, is rarely successful. People will usually see it as a source of disruption. You won’t have a full understanding of the problems or how they came about, and how they have tried to solve them in the past.
So I start by listening. I listen to interactions, I try to understand inside jokes, understand what worries they might have ( big or small ) on a personal and professional level. I usually try to avoid making any major decisions without understand all of the problematic.
Before this, I only had the experience of working with people that mostly were beside me or at least within the same city. When presented with this challenge I immediately identified two important issues — Not sharing the same space and different timezones. I started to read a lot about remote working, and even though most of it referred to individuals rather than a team setting, the underlying principles still apply, so I could already see some issues that we were bound to face.
So how do you connect and work with people taking into account these possible issues? You communicate! You over communicate! You spend a lot of time talking to be on the same page.
Communication will also help when different cultures are in play. I spend some time understanding not only how they are as individuals, but also the cultural traces in their personalities. And whatever I didn’t understand I would ask. An expression, a feeling, some sarcastic remark, or jokes that I didn’t get… I much prefer to ask than sit there guessing.
I found a great team with awesome individuals on the client side. When we came onboard, with us being an offshore team, it is easy to start setting up a divide between people. Us and them. Them and us. Fortunately, the client is amazing and they had the same way of thinking as I did!
They gave us company emails. We had access to the same communications channels as them. We got access to staging and production servers. We got t-shirts! They treated us, and expected from us, the same as any person in their company.
No one gains from one side being treated differently. For me, the only way for this to work as best as possible is through letting the offshore team be completely integrated with the process/spirit of the client. Of course, there’s a large component of trust involved, but with this kind of attitude, they’ll gain people eager to help since they share the client goals and view them as their own.
It is important to note that this is something that needs to be addressed on both sides and is a never ending story, a continuous and ongoing effort. It can happen naturally, but you also have to create and nurture an environment where people can continue to grow and feel valued.
Sometimes you will make mistakes… I believe it’s not a matter of if but when. You will have an unexpected behaviour, or you will introduce a bug in the system. At some point in time, you will do something that’s not in the greater plan of things.
What are the next steps? Tell the truth! Admit your mistake.
Maybe they will understand, maybe they won’t. One thing is for sure though, you will grow and strengthen the bonds that everyone shares. I see no harm in making mistakes, the problem is when people don’t admit to them.
From the first day, I try to remove any dependency on us that the client might have. If I see something that might create a dependency I try to plan how to remove it. Are we the only ones with knowledge on some part of the platform? Let’s pass that knowledge on to someone on the client’s side. For some clients we’re the only source of technology on their team. When that happens we have to be extra careful and try to complement that with a better knowledge base on the tech side of things.
I do the same on a team level ( I’ve written about that subject in a different blog post ), so I apply the same principle. “Isn’t it great for business if I create dependency?” — I hear you ask. Of course it is, but that isn’t the way we work. We want people to work with us because we are great at what we do; not because they are shackled to us due to an over-reliance on what we know.
This was a great experience! The things I’ve learned from working with a different country and timezone; for a different culture, with different views, is something that has helped me to grow immensely! Sharing knowledge and views and understanding the culture was an awesome experience.
If you have any comments or feedback on this subject, I’d love to hear from you!
Nowadays I’m working in my own company trying to bring some products ( like https://isdown.app ) to life. Besides product development, I love to build and scale engineering teams. If you have any questions, feel free to ping me on Twitter or LinkedIn or just leave a comment.
Also, check out Runtime Revolution. It’s an awesome product development agency with a proven track record helping clients scaling their engineering teams with an offshore team.

By sheer luck, we arrived in Lisbon during Festa de Santiago Antonio (The Feast of Saint Anthony). This month-long celebration of Anthony of Padua (who is actually not the patron saint of Lisbon but is preferred by the locals) sees the city transform into a spectacular carnival. The streets are decorated with colorful ribbons, street food stalls are packed into every open corner, cold beer flows from the taps, and the air smells of grilled anchovies.
Saint Anthony is also referred to as the holy matchmaker. During each festival, 16 lucky couples get to wed in a lavish ceremony!
We spent most of our days in Lisbon walking and eating, eating and walking. Since Lisbon is known as “the city of seven hills,” it was easy to work up an appetite. Even coming from San Francisco (which is quite hilly) we were impressed by the steepness of several streets. To address the challenges of getting from point A to B in the city, many of the steeper streets have funicular trains ready to ferry people up and down the hills.
We treated ourselves to the street food stalls on many many occasions…
Our host also shared his cooking with us!
On our third day, we took the ferry across Tagus Bay to the city of Cacilhas and followed an abandoned road along the water. This road eventually led to a statue of Christ the Redeemer, a monument inspired by the one in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. This statue (inaugurated in 1959) was created to express gratitude that the Portuguese were spared the worst effects of World War II. It also looks over the April 25 bridge…which looks awfully familiar to the one we just left behind.
In 1775, one of Europe’s most powerful earthquakes hit Lisbon (estimated to be between 8.0 and 9.0). The earthquake struck during a holiday morning and did catastrophic damage, killing an estimated 60,000 people and destroying 85% of the city. Subsequent fires then burned in Lisbon for over 6 days and a tsunami with waves over 20 feet hit the shore.
The pic below is from the Alfama neighborhood. This neighborhood is one of the oldest in the city having been spared the worst of the earthquake damage.
Sadly, 5 days weren’t near enough for Lisbon (or Portugal obviously)! Hoping we will return!
Olá- hello
Obrigad(a/o) — thanks (the o or a depends on the gender of the SPEAKER… confusing for my Spanish-oriented brain)
Saúde-cheers!

Kristina, I am glad to meet you and am simply enchanted by your artworks — I cannot find a better name to describe what you do. Let’s start from the very beginning. Your passion for photography and your first creative steps took place… Where and when?
I was born and raised in the southern part of Ukraine. Since I was a very artistic child, my parents used the opportunity — they introduced me to all kinds of creative expression: painting, music, dancing. I was fond of seeing the beauty of the moment and at some point, — around age 7–8 years old — when my grandparents bought one of those first digital cameras, I started taking photos. Just shooting everything I saw around — mostly nature. Of course, not all of the shots, but some, made my grandpa admit “Oh, she’s a good eye!”.It was the very beginning of my photography path. Hence, shooting nature still attracts me — it is a way of meditation and a source of inspiration for me.Another way of expressing my mood and showcasing creativity was artistic shooting with a good friend from my school. We used to dress up and invent themed photoshoots, crafting all the details from scratch with our own hands — they were important — and incorporating a touch of aesthetics to each picture.Finally, I kept forgetting and belittling one important point — my photos were displayed in a town hall exhibition in my hometown. It was literally the whole exhibition of my photographs. Talking about it now, I feel goosebumps.
So nature was your primary shooting experience. What about developing your eye and style? What kind of photography mostly attracts you now? What would you call your favorite style and does it allow experimenting?
Since humans are a part of nature, I love shooting portraits and body portraits. Now I will explain myself better. When I take a photo, I try to capture the expression so that the dialogue between the person and their sensations is seen in the picture. There is much more than face and body when it comes to seeing body language. I find gestures, movement, shapes, and sights even more important than the primary image, clothing sets, and surroundings. I like minimalistic photos, which speak to people’s hearts more than to their brains and eyes. However, aesthetics are very important to me — I always see it in details and (people say) am good at showcasing it.
Is there anything really special for you during the photoshoot? Something you can never omit.
My point is using the photoshoot as a therapy. It is an intimate process which I can really compare to a confession. The camera sees a lot. However, I have 3 main rules for any shooting to take place smoothly. Before we shoot , we need to meet and have a talk over a coffee or tea, or whatever. It helps the person to open up and feel more comfortable.And the second thing is that the person should understand what they feel like during the process. It is essential, as the sensations and feelings cannot be hidden once snapped with a camera. That’s why I need the first step of meeting before the shoot — so there is no intimidation, but freedom and comfort.Rule number 3 is putting myself into the model’s shoes from time to time — it makes me understand how a person in front of the camera feels in different situations. In case I realize there are some points making me uncomfortable as a model, I avoid them in my own shoots.
Are there any taboos for you? What would you never shoot?
My principle goes far beyond any taboos — I try everything at least once. Otherwise, how would I know if there is something I like or I don’t like? Every kind of art is unique and it might make you come up with some deep ideas — it will make you broaden your skills or knowledge.I am pretty much philosophical in this aspect. Everything can take place, unless it is your own experience telling you that you don’t like it.
An idea as your motto during your lifetime? Or a couple of them…
In my opinion , there is always something going on in life which can change our perception, our opinion , and our principles. So there is no constant definition of what guides me in life other than changes. I guess there is a saying that the only permanent thing in life is change. And this is what I totally agree with. The strategy can change according to your goals, your values , and your sensations — and it would be a very poor decision to follow only one rule for the whole of your life.

In Lisbon’s Mouraria, the birthplace of a legend.
Fado (“Fate”) is Portuguese “Blues” music born in the slums of Lisbon in the 1820s…Well, that’s the kind of intro you might expect to read in an article about Fado. To our surprise, flaneuring through the winding streets of the Mouraria in the oldest part of Lisbon, Teresa and I discovered the actual birthplace of the woman whose music marked the emergence of Fado from the shadows into the light.
The plan for the day, in as much as there was one, was to start at the Chapel of Our Lady of Health, at the bottom of the Mouraria, wander through the backways until we got hungry, and then find our way to Zé da Mourari, a traditional Portuguese restaurant that Teresa particularly wanted to try.
The chapel was built as an appeal to the Virgin Mary for her to intercede with God and save the city from the plague, which ravaged Lisbon during the 16th Century. The crowned statue of Mary at the front of the chapel is still paraded around the neighborhood once each year in thanks for her deliverance.
Just behind the church, the roads zigzag up and along the hillside towards Sao Jorge Castle, through the Mouraria, one of the few parts of the city that survived the earthquake of 1755. The name means “Moor-area.” It’s the old quarter of the city where the muslims were confined after the Christian reconquest of Lisbon in 1147. Because of its narrow winding alleyways and crooked streets, The Mouraria remained a magnet for outcasts. It attracted a rougher crowd of immigrants, sailors and sex-workers. Now it’s just starting to emerge as a rather hip part of Lisbon, while still keeping its authentic character.
Strangely enough, as we soon discovered, many of the immigrant in this neighborhood today are from Bangladesh — the new muslims who are welcomed to Portugal. It’s obvious not only from the restaurants and stores with Bengali signs, but also from the colorful men’s sarongs hanging out the windows to dry with the laundry. Even the graffiti and street art has a Bengali flair.
We wandered around until our feet got sore, then headed in the general direction of the restaurant. The road narrowed, then widened into a tiny square with two trees loaded with oranges in the center. The houses here were old, not more than two stories, with some of the doors laughably tiny. The artwork on the walls was playful yet beautifully done. We were captivated.
The walls contained some clever visual jokes, like this woman blowing miniature ballerinas towards a cat…
And this door with a poem scrawled next to it that reads: “I want my love/There is no other/I want my love/There goes another!”
We noticed at the far end of the little square a gleaming white building that seemed almost out of place in the scruffy but well-decorated little square. A sign on the building explained that this square was named in honor of Fado legend Maria Severa, who was born in this house in 1820 and lived in this neighborhood.
Her father was a gypsy, her mother owned a tavern and was a sex-worker known as “ Barbuda” — the bearded one. Maria, however, was great beauty by all accounts, and perhaps unavoidably fell into her mother’s profession. She sang early Fado songs in the taverns and brothels of the Mouraria. According to one source (Lisboa, a Love Affair), she was the first person to sing fados in the street, accompanying herself on guitar and composing her own lyrics. She sang about her life and her problems: love and heartbreak, betrayal, jealousy, revenge, tragedy; the same problems as the people she lived among. Her style of Fado became wildly popular. Indeed, one has to wonder if strands of this acceptance of hardship that will break the soul might have gone all the way back to the moors left to fend for themselves on this hill.
There are no portraits of Maria, but here are some descriptions written by various writers who met her: (with thanks to my source Atlas Lisboa):
Writer Luis Augusto Palmeirim: When I entered Severa’s house, a modest dwelling of the vulgar type her unlucky peers inhabit, there she was, smoking, leaning back on a straw couch, wearing polishing slippers dotted with red twine, a silk flowery kerchief on her head and the sleeves of her dress rolled up to the elbows. She was a rather swarthy, thin, nervous woman, remarkable for her magnificent peninsular eyes. On the gaming table laid a guitar, the inseparable companion to her triumphs.
Poet Bulhão Pato: It will be difficult for another Severa to appear, haughty and impetuous, so generous as ready to punch the face of whoever would act rogue on her! Brave, full of affection for the ones she cared for, as well as rough to her enemies, She was no ordinary woman, you can be sure of that.
One of her lovers was the Count of Vimioso, a “bohemian” aristocrat who used to take Maria out to bullfights. This gave her exposure beyond the Mouraria. She was hired to sing at parties in high society, and her reputation grew. Tragically, Maria died of tubuculosis at the age of twenty six. However according to Lisboa, a Love Affair, what she really died of was a broken heart, because the social difference between her and the count was never going to allow a marriage between them: “She actually died poor and abandoned, of tuberculosis, in a miserable brothel on Rua do Capelão, on November 30, 1846…Her last words are said to have been: ‘I die without ever having lived’ — She was 26 years old.”
Something in her music had quickened the heart of Lisbon. Fado had changed because of her; it became this powerful expression of desire crushed by fate. Because of Maria, Fado moved from the shadows into popular culture. Her life became a legend, then the subject of a novel, then a play, which in 1933 was turned into the first Portugese movie ever made with sound.
As Teresa and I strolled from the little square that bore the legend’s name, I thought about the shrines to these two Marias, just a few short blocks from one another. The people of Lisbon loved the Virgin Mary because she saved them from their fate. They loved Maria Severa because she sang about their fate. She transformed their sorrow into more than simply suffering. She made it into something beautiful and holy.

TLDR there were some interesting talks at remote Web Summit this year, but the real value of Web Summit is the ad-hoc meeting and chatting with people, seeing what startups from across the world are working on, and seeing just in general what the tech world is up to. All of which is much more difficult remotely.
Last week I attended the Web Summit tech conference for what I think was the 6th time. I went two or maybe three times in Dublin (I must be getting old if I can’t remember my conference visits!), twice in Lisbon, and now once from the comfort of my MacBook in Kildare.
You can read previous reviews of my colleagues and I’s trips — 2017 here and 2018 here, and they’re obviously quite different from the experience this year. Going to Lisbon was of course part of the fun, but even when it was in Dublin and I just had to walk across the road from my office in Ballsbridge to the RDS, being there in person was infinitely better.
Most talks at tech conferences are interesting at best, boring at worst, but rarely have anything revelatory; for the most part you are unlikely to hear anything you didn’t know already. AWS re:Invent being the obvious exception, where they launch new services at the event — but even with these you can always watch the repeats online afterwards.
One advantage of Web Summit however is the sheer scale — it is huge, with more talks running in parallel for several days than you’d ever get to see — so when it was held in person there are always diamonds among the rough, and if a talk isn’t that good you just stroll over to another one. Remotely however it was difficult to stay focused on the talks, and trying to find the good ones, when work and real life were also competing.
Throughout the three days, even though I’d kept meetings to a minimum, I found myself working on my current project and sending emails more than I spent “at” the conference. It was hard to justify to myself postponing working on an important new feature for watching something online; I always feel pressure to deliver in work, and when I wasn’t actually in a different country at an event, it felt slightly wrong to be sitting there watching talks when I could be building.
There were some exceptions — I saw a great talk by Siemens’ Carolina Alves & Francisco Freitas on using machine learning to recognise dangerous driving in traffic. Their talk was a detailed and honest account of their work, how they gathered and labeled data (a hackathon!) and more. AI and ML is already becoming so important to business, and I love seeing real-world examples like this of putting it into practice.
I saw another refreshingly honest talk, again also by Siemens (Aymeric Sarrazin and CTO Peter Keorte), about IoT, where even though the title was “How IoT will change the world”, they discussed how there is still a lot of work to be done before happens and that IoT is an enabler of change, as oppose to the change in itself.
I attended others which were good also, and I had a lot marked down in my schedule, but I found myself missing a lot of them as I got distracted by my “real” work.
Most of my time at the physical Web Summits was spent just wandering around the huge halls, browsing the startup stands and chatting with people if something looked interesting. Most of the big outfits also had stands, usually with an interesting piece of tech to try out — like in 2017 when I got to try out a quick development tutorial on the HoloLens:
This year there was none of that, at least for me anyway. I was contacted by a fair few people looking to have a “virtual coffee”, and it’s always good to meet people, but these were mostly sales pitches. I missed the casual conversations, seeing companies and projects that I wasn’t expecting to see, and the learning which comes from being immersed for a few days in all things tech.
Web Summit used to have organised pub crawls aswell, which as well as great for seeing more of beautiful Lisbon, was another fun way to meet and network with people from across the world. The most networking I got done this week was with a 2 year old who loves trying to mash my keyboard as I’m working.
I’m hoping the world can return to some level of normal next year and the Web Summit and other conferences can return to what they were, but this year’s won’t be making the top 5. Or is that 6?
I have to mention that I’m fully aware that being stuck at home and not enjoying a few days in Lisbon is not in any way hardship; I’m safe at home, with a great job that allows me to attend events like this, remote or otherwise.
I’ve friends in healthcare who risk their lives every day for the rest of us, so any complaints here are not real complaints, I know how privileged I am to blogging about tech conferences!
Any thoughts or comments, let me know below, or feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or Twitter. You can learn more about my company, Liberty IT here and yes, we’re hiring!

This is true! I’m in Lisbon multiple times a year and my Uber from Oriente to the clinic I visit always traverses this circle. Lisbon is 100% a non driving city for me. Down in the Algarve where we live, we joyfully drive. Great piece!

Lisbon is a must visit while traveling to Europe. It is a very affordable city compared to most in Western Europe, but doesn’t skip out on great food, excellent site seeing, and amazing shopping.
My Experience
After graduating college in the Spring of 2022, my girlfriend and I took a month long trip to Europe. Our final destination was Lisbon before flying back to Miami. Let me just say, it was a great way to end our trip on a high note.
Food
Lisbon had some great eats everywhere we went. I would say a big highlight was TimeOut Market. This was a huge food market in which you had the option of any kind of food you are in the mood for. Everything we tried here was delicious. We also made sure to try Portugal’s famous pastry, Pastel de Nada, at multiple locations. This sweet treat with some espresso was always an amazing way to start off the day.
The biggest food standout of Lisbon was a slice of chocolate cake, see below. This is easily the best cake I have ever eaten in my life. I would travel back to Lisbon just to have another slice. If you ever visit Lisbon, eating this cake should be the number 1 thing to do on your list.

There is something perplexing about attempting to express oneself in any language. This issue becomes more salient when what we are trying to articulate is an experience rife with a mosaic of sentiments too complex to comprehend outright, let alone to transform into words. The constant urge to do so, though, does not emerge out of nothing. Our compulsion is primarily driven by an inexplicable urge to dress fuzzy pre-conceptual experiences in words that we understand in order to be able to share them with others. In an attempt to capture fleeting experiences we have, we might try everything at our disposal to grab on to, and subsequently frame, memories that seem to make our lives more colorful, in hopes of chiseling ourselves into becoming interesting individuals not only vis a vis ourselves, but also in the eyes of others.
We encounter such an interesting example in the novel Night Train to Lisbon written by the philosophy professor Peter Bieri under the pseudonym Pascal Mercier. At the very beginning the protagonist of the story (Raimund Gregorius), a teacher of classics at a Gymnasium in the city of Bern, Switzerland, has an encounter which would forever change his life.
On his way to school, Gregorius meets a lady wearing a red coat standing on the Kirchenfeld Bridge, ready to jump and end her life. No sooner than Gregorius realizes this than he rushes to try and stop her — and he does so successfully. She later on accompanies him to school, and along the way he learns that her native language was Portuguese.
As banal and mundane this happenstance might seem, it was sufficient to turn Gregorius’ life upside down in a way he wouldn’t have imagined.
The experience itself might have had nothing to do with the radical decisions he would subsequently make, but it definitely played a rather crucial role in the abrupt shift that would see him embarking on an odyssey of self-discovery and transformation.
Experiences of this calibre tend to instigate us to brusquely but intentionally decide to change the course of our lives as a consequence of an inevitable outburst due to the endless, unconscious, accumulation of selves that one keeps hoarding with the passing of time.
One day we think we’re going to start a new job at our dream company, the other we find ourselves doing something we wouldn’t have imagined doing not in a hundred years time. Change is infinitesimal and can be very difficult to discern. Crossing a certain threshold, we look in the mirror and understand that we cannot recognize ourselves anymore. Where does this dissonance come from though? Why is it too difficult to ‘go with the flow’, to give in to the uncertainties of life, and incorporate change as a core feature of life? These questions present themselves in their blinding clarity when on a day like any other Gregorius is stricken by a sudden realization that he did not know who he was anymore.
In a fate-like circumstance, Gregorius knew that something was different the second he met the lady in red standing on the bridge reading a paper under the rain. Somehow this event made him decide to leave his stuff behind and walk away from school without looking back.
Driven by a curious desire to plunge himself into the unknown, the initial contours of the rebellion against his previous self materialized in the form of breakfast, which he left intact, at a hotel’s restaurant where he had never been before.
After that, he visited a Spanish library that he used to frequent. The concatenation of events led him to stumble upon a book, written in Portuguese, left behind on a table by a customer. The encounter with the lady in red was still haunting him, and it seemed to him that the pieces of the puzzle were coming right into place.
Gregorius knew that the compass of his exciting new endeavor was pointing in the right direction when the first paragraph, which he made the owner of the library read and translate for him, said the following:
“Of thousand experiences we have, we find language for one at most and even this one merely by chance and without the care it deserves. Buried under all the mute experiences are those unseen ones that give our life its form, its color, and its melody. Then, when we turn to these treasures, as archeologists of the soul, we discover how confusing they are. The subject of contemplation refuses to stand still, the words bounce off the experience and in the end, pure contradictions stand on the paper. For a long time, I thought it was a defect, something to be overcome. Today I think it’s different: that recognition of the confusion is the ideal path to understanding these intimate yet enigmatic experiences. That sounds strange, even bizarre, I know. But ever since I have seen the issue in this light, I have the feeling of being really awake and alive for the first time.”
It was a passage that resonated strongly with him, so much so that he decided to jump on a train to Lisbon to track down the writer of the book titled A Goldsmith of Words by Amadeu de Prado. De Prado, as Gregorius would eventually figure out, was a medical doctor who had helped treat one of the central figures of the Salazar regime. Motivated by a sense of guilt at having saved the Butcher of Lisbon’s life, he decided to join the resistance in penitence for his ‘sin’.
In a sense, Gregorius was on a journey of self-discovery that was primarily guided by a curiosity to learn more about the biography of Amadeu de Prado. Perhaps, he thought to himself, he would know more about himself by getting to walk in the shoes of someone else. During the ‘search’, Gregorius had the time to contemplate and reflect upon himself by recalling important episodes of his life when he had to make crucial decisions, and to imagine alternative scenarios in the case that he had chosen differently. Deciphering de Prado’s book, he thought to himself, he would be able to authentically know himself more profoundly.
However, two things scared Gregorius during the quest made more than anything else: 1) falling unconscious because of recurrent episodes of dizziness, which he thought, could cause memory loss, and 2) seeing any doctor whom he didn’t know because fearing that the doctor would make him lose himself.
This latter was a major source of concern right before getting some medicals done following the advice of his Ophthalmologist. “What if they find something bad? Something that would make me lose myself?” Gregorius asked him.
Gregorius’ dealt with his terrible hypochondria-like fear by finding recourse in the static, dead languages of the past, like ancient Greek and Hebrew. However, one of de Prado’s reflections cited below, prompted him to reexamine his views.
“Maybe it’s like this: I’d like to rearrange Portuguese words. The sentences that would emerge from this new order must not be odd or eccentric, not exalted, affected or artificial. They must be archetypal sentences in Portuguese so that you have the feeling that they originated directly and from the transparent, sparkling nature of this language. The words must be as unblemished as polished marble, and they must be pure as the notes in a Back partita, which turn everything that is not themselves into a perfect silence. Sometimes, when I am feeling more tolerant about the linguistic morass, I think, it could be the easy silence of a living room or the relaxed silence between lovers. But when I am totally possessed by rage over the clichéd use of words, then it must be nothing less than the clear, cool silence of outer space, where I make my solitary way as the only person who speaks Portuguese.”
For Gregorius, the passage felt like a call to return to the basics of a language in order to reinvent it in an attempt to capture the concreteness of life experiences. The result, as de Prado suggests, would be an ‘unblemished, laconic text’; a language that, while not completely new, succeeds to express beautifully the essence of inner experiences.
De Prado’s reflection underscores a human necessity to continuously renew oneself like a chrysalis throughout different stages in our lives.
Externally, this idea manifests in the form of excessive consumption. Buying the latest model of any product seems to satisfy a lurking desire to periodically renew and revitalize ourselves.
Internally, it manifests in the form of a constant struggle to articulate the mounting change in our idiosyncrasies which according to de Prado and Gregorius, can be achieved by waxing lyrical in the hopes of capturing our concrete experiences through a genuine discourse rather than by alluding to concepts or languages long dead.
This is echoed by Amadeu de Prado’s reflections where he asserts that expressing oneself anew can be achieved by twisting the language to resuscitate faded concepts in order to make them adapt to our continuously evolving life experiences.
Unfortunately, this struggle never ends because as Nietzsche, who had a fine grasp of this interminable dance, eloquently writes:
“Alas! what are you, my written and my painted thoughts! Not long ago you were young and malicious and full of thorns and secret spices- you made me sneeze and laugh- and now? You have doffed your novelty, and some of you, I fear, are ready to become truths, so immortal do they look, so tediously honest! And was it ever otherwise? What then do we write and paint, we mandarins with Chinese brush? Alas, only that which is about to fade and lose its scent! Alas, only birds exhausted by flight, which let themselves be caught with our hand! We immortalize things exhausted and mellow! And it is only for your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have many colors; but nobody will divine how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved- wicked thoughts!”

Have you ever found yourself running on empty, going through the motions without really feeling connected to what you’re doing?
That’s where I was before this trip. There’s a point when you realize you’re just… tired. Not just physically, but emotionally and creatively. I needed this trip not just to escape but to find myself again.
We live in a world that worships hustle, where productivity is often measured by how much we do, how busy we are, and how little we rest. I’ve always been someone who pushes through, who keeps going even when I know I’m running on nothing but coffee and maybe sugar lol. But as I wandered through the streets of Barcelona, from the towering Sagrada Familia to the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter, I realized something.
These iconic places are filled with life and energy, but instead of feeling energized, I realized I was missing the point. I was so focused on seeing everything and doing everything that I wasn’t truly experiencing any of it. Even on the subway, surrounded by people, I felt disconnected, like I was just going through the motions. It hit me that maybe, just maybe, it was okay to slow down and not do it all.
Rest isn’t just about lying down or sitting still. It’s about giving yourself permission to move at your own pace, to let go of the need to be constantly productive. As I walked through the narrow streets of Alfama, I felt something shift. The colorful buildings, the quiet moments — they invited me to slow down and just be.
Sitting at Castelo de Sao Jorge, looking out over the city, I didn’t feel the usual urge to capture the perfect photo or check off the next item on the list. Instead, I let myself just enjoy the view, the company, the moment. When we wandered into a little perfume store, it wasn’t about buying something; it was about the simple pleasure of experiencing something new, something beautiful, without any pressure. These small moments reminded me that it’s okay to simply exist, to find joy in the present.
Something I hadn’t expected was how much inspiration I would find just by slowing down and paying attention. In the midst of the busy streets, the street art, the intricate tiles, the history embedded in the architecture — even these chairs all over Barcelona — it all started to speak to me in a way I hadn’t felt in a long time.
Everywhere I looked, there was something that sparked my imagination — a piece of street art that made me pause, a beautifully tiled floor that told a story, even the way the buildings stood, each with its own history and character. It reminded me that creativity isn’t always about creating; sometimes, it’s about observing, about letting the world around you fill you with new ideas and perspectives. I realized that inspiration is everywhere if you just take the time to see it.
But beyond the beauty of the cities and the inspiration I found in the streets, what really stayed with me were the moments of connection. Sharing a meal, laughing with friends, those little moments of joy — they’re what made this trip truly meaningful. Like when we finally got our hands on those infamous Pastel da Nata from Pasteis de Belem — AMAZING.
Whether it was enjoying crepes, chatting at the plaza while eating gelato at midnight, or just sitting down for brunch at 4 p.m. because we felt like it — these moments weren’t about doing something impressive. They were about being present with the people I care about, about savoring life in its simplest, most joyful forms. And honestly, that’s where I found the most rest — in those small, meaningful moments that reminded me of what’s really important.
As I walked down the well in Quinta da Regaleira, it felt like a metaphor for what this trip had been — descending into the unknown, into a place of quiet and reflection. And just like that well, this journey brought me back up, feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to move forward. I realized that rest is its own form of productivity. It’s in those moments of stillness and quiet that we find the clarity we need to truly grow.”
I came on this trip looking for a break, a way to recharge. What I found was that rest isn’t just about doing nothing — it’s about finding the space to reconnect with yourself and to rediscover what brings you joy and peace.
So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this trip, it’s that it’s okay to take a step back. To slow down, to rest, and to reconnect with what really matters. When you give yourself permission to rest, you’re not just recharging — you’re laying the foundation for everything that comes next.

With ample sun, sights, and awesome food, there’s a ton to see and do in Lisbon, Portugal. The real magic of Lisbon comes from exploring its side streets and alleys, but there’s so much to experience all around that a good plan is needed. It’s also a spread out and hilly city, so making the most of it involves some walking and creative use of the public transportation. With a short amount of time or compressed schedule in this glimmering historic city, make sure to make the most of it to see and do the best this city has to offer.

You know when someone has a YouTube video that they want you to watch sooo badly and they SWEAR it is hysterical and that you are going to absolutely LOVE it?
And somehow the more they tell you how much you’re going to love to it, the more it kinda makes you want to not like it out of stubborn principle?
By the time you finally say “fk it” and watch the damn video to get them off your back, you’re forced into one of those super awkward fake laughs just so you don’t hurt their feelings and look like a huge asshole.
Yeah, that’s kinda how I felt about Portugal going into month 3.
I’ll preface this by saying that following Prague would be unfair for any city on our itinerary in my opinion. I had just gotten into a groove by the end of last month and was feeling all of those homey vibes I talked about in my recap post.
It sounds dumb, I know, but I have been feeling the pressure to love Lisbon this first week. I think it’s a combination of how bummed I was to leave Prague, how every site seems to have Portugal in its “Top Destinations for 2017”, and how much people who have been here before told me how much I’m going to like it. Whatever the reasoning, it just didn’t wow me right off the bat.
I’m that annoying kind of person who likes things less when people tell you how you’re going to react to them. It applies to most things — YouTube vids, songs, TV shows, and apparently cities.
I’m fully aware that it’s so stupid and that Lisbon really is incredible…it just took me a couple days to forgive it for being #notprague.
All of that being said, after spending more time in Lisbon and a weekend in Porto, it’s easy to see why Portugal belongs on all of those lists.
Lisbon is the most colorful city that I’ve ever been in. From the purple jacaranda trees to the colorful buildings decorated with brightly colored paint/tile/street art to the rainbow-like sunsets, there’s a ton of things to stare at. I mean, there are even peacocks everywhere.
The vibes from the people in Lisbon have been really incredible. People are friendly, speak good English, and are extremely social.
One of my favorite things so far has been seeing the big groups of people organically congregate around sunset at this spot called Santa Catarina which has an incredible view of the city. Every night people go there to have some drinks, play random instruments, and even sing. It’s a lot of fun to be around.
One of the best parts about moving from place to place every month is the opportunity that each new month gives you to hit the reset button. A lot of people, including myself, were feeling a little doughy leaving Prague because of all the bread, potatoes, and beer that we consumed. Before leaving Prague, our Program Leader, Mama Jen, proposed that mayyyybee this month we put some focus on getting kai-razy fit. Everyone nodded in agreement (and shame) as they took another sip from their Pilsner.
Lisbon has been the perfect place to hit the reset button with the awesome gym that we are all going to, the hills (oh, sweet Jesus, the hills…), the surfing lessons, and the lighter food and beverages.
I’m excited for this month because as a group we are focusing more and more on setting our goals for the year and supporting each other in achieving them. Looking back during the Pre-RY days, I wish I spent more time planning on how to get what I want out of this year and less time on what size of GoToobs I should get (“…but the 2oz ones have the little suction cup thingys and the 3oz don’t!” ← a real internal struggle for me *face palm*).
Also, next month Valentina and I will be going to a weekend retreat that brings together Remotes from different programs for sessions about creating change and developing new habits. Really excited about this.
Fortuitous timing gave us the opportunity to use Remote Year’s newest work space, which just opened last month. It’s got a similar feel to the WiP workspace we had in Split, but it’s different enough to make it feel like its own unique place.
Most importantly, it’s got a quiet room that is reminiscent of the quiet room (called “the library”) that I basically lived in at in the office back in Austin.

One of the things that everyone tells you when you talk about having babies is “no more travelling!”. I’ve always challenged this assumption and thought (and said) “Why? It must be slightly more challenging, but some people do it”. “Oh, you have no idea”.
I would then kind of give up and wouldn’t challenge it too much as I didn’t have babies, so if this was true, I would only understand it once I had them.
And then I had a baby. As we are Portuguese we had to plan our first holidays to visit the family in Portugal, and that meant travelling.
So we planned our first trip to Portugal. By car. From London to Lisbon. With a 3 months old.
Our friends with babies said “You’re crazy! You have no idea what you’re getting into!”. And once again we thought “What’s the big deal?”. But we had never travelled with Dinis so if it was that hard, we would only understand it once we travelled. And so we did.
Our first and most difficult trip was on August 2018 when Dinis was 3 months old. Because we wanted to spend a month in Portugal and we have Mia (our black Labrador) we decided to drive, so she could come with us (I know #crazy).
Was it cheaper than flights and leaving Mia with a dogsitter? Not really. But it was more about having her with us for all that time to be honest. A month is a long time to leave her behind. Was it easy? Nop. Did we survive? Yes. Both on the way to Lisbon and back.
Driving to Portugal from London nonstop takes 21h26 min (according to Google Maps).
We had already done it when we went to Portugal to get married and we took two days (about 12h drive each day). But with Dinis we left London, drove down to France, through to Spain and arrived in Portugal 5 days later (one of the days was a stay-over at my brother’s in France). So a 4 day drive. Double the time we had done before. And why? Well, let me explain.
There’s a few challenges when travelling with a baby in a car.
First, you need to stop every two hours. Babies shouldn’t stay in the car seat for longer than that until they’re 6 months due to risks of suffocation. So João planned a 6 hour of drive per day, with a stop every two hours. So ideally, we would spend about 8 hours a day travelling to a new destination with minimum stops included.
But our drives took about 12 hours each day. And why? Because you should only stop every 2 hours for safety purposes, but a baby has a mind of their own. They’re hungry, they pee, they poop and most of all they get bored and cry about it. Especially when they’re not used to being in a car that often (which is our case, we don’t own a car in London).
So that’s the hardest bit, you need to stop often and irregularly. You also need to be patient and either teach your baby to self soothe to sleep before you travel, during your travel or stop every single time your baby is upset or needs to sleep.
I’m not going to lie, he did get very upset a few times during our travels and at times where we couldn’t stop straight away as we’d miss the exit for a resting area. But the truth is they are not hurting, so you just need to try and calm them down with other distractions until you’re able to make the stop.
With the following travels (by plane), one thing I’ve noticed, is that breastfeeding is great for airplanes but not that great for cars. In a moving car, it’s not safe to take the baby out of the seat and hold them in the car. Should an accident happen (as we all know, these are unpredictable) and the chances of survival drop drastically.
For breastfeeding to work we, we need to feed the babies on demand. So sometimes they might sleep for 2 hours nonstop and have to be waken up, sometimes they feed every 30 min.
That’s when formula (or expressing if you’re good at it and have the patience for it) is a great help. You just need fresh boiled water in a flask, some prepared formula doses, bottles and you’re good to go!
This depends on the babies. Some babies are extremely sensitive to dirty nappies in the first months and will complain about it straight away. Dinis was like that. I understand! It must be just slightly uncomfortable to be sitting in your own pee or poop. Most rest stops will have toilets with changing tables for you to change your baby.
But when they don’t you quickly learn to improvise. I changed Dinis on grass, on a table and a lot of times on my lap whilst sitting in the car. It’s not very easy, and it depends on the size of your baby (I struggled more on the way back to London as he had grown during that month), but it’s doable.
Naps are a bliss. When they happen. I’m sooo glad decided to try and fix Dinis’ sleep before we travelled.
I believe a baby that doesn’t know how to, needs to be taught to sleep. Is it easier said than done? Hell yeah! Can it be done? Hell yeah.
From week 3, Dinis stopped sleeping properly during the day, giving me good nights, but terrible days. I couldn’t do anything. He wouldn’t even like being in the sling for too long as it was a very hot summer in London last year. So, two weeks before travelling and after 2 months of sleep struggle, we had enough and had to do something about it.
I don’t like the Ferber method (leaving your kid to cry on his own), I find it too harsh and I honestly think it wouldn’t work on Dinis (he’s a stubborn one), so I used the Tracy Hogg method (her book is on my Approved tab under the “Mum Books tab”) and we fixed Dinis’ naps during the day whilst his sleep pattern remained unchanged. From barely any sleep during the day, only sleeping on my chest we got to 3 naps a day (one of them a 2 hours nap). And him being able to get to sleep with no “boob aid” was what helped soooo much during our trip. Not that I didn’t breastfed him to sleep a few times. But at least half the time he would go to sleep on his own whilst we were on route with minimal fuss.
Should you have no time to read anything else past this (I know how motherhood works) my top tip for travelling with a baby is the following: Just go.
As with a lot of things in life, the thought of travelling with our baby is scarier and way more difficult than actually travelling with our baby. Because once you’re on route, it’s actually fine. So just grab your baby, and go. Well, prepare a little of course. But don’t let the thought of it stop you from going.
Because we’re two Portuguese living in London, if we want to see our family we need to travel. And since Dinis was born, we made 3 trips to Portugal and went to Prague on holidays. So that “impossible to travel once you have a baby” is nonsense to me. You’re a bit more limited money wise, you need to plan a bit more, but otherwise it’s all good. You just need to be a bit more flexible about your normal routine and not worry about how that will permanently affect your baby: it will not. Babies are sponges, they absorb what’s around them and they will change quickly and more effectively than we adults do. They just go with the flow.
Was this an easy trip? Not really. But would we do this again? Yes, we would. If anything it made us feel brave and made us not fear any other trip we will do with him.
So that’s it. Do it. You and your baby will be fine. And he might not remember much of it, but he will love it and you will have the best memories of it.
Hug, Millia

The ultimate guide to discover Portugal´s hidden gems

Portugal’s capital is having a moment and Americans are taking notice. Lisbon has planted itself on the radar of wealthy U.S. property buyers, drawn in by the city’s charm, affordability, and a rental market that’s too good to pass up. This year alone, at Goldcrest Buyers Agency we had a surge of over 15% on enquiries from US citizens — and I will explain why Lisbon is such an attractive destination for real estate investors.
Particularly for American investors, Lisbon offers the best of both worlds, a charming, laidback lifestyle at a fraction of the living costs as back home, and a favorable property investment scene.
Recently ranked as the sixth most profitable European city for property rentals by Global Property Guide, it’s outshining traditionally popular spots like Paris, Berlin and London. Rental yields in Lisbon averaged 5.65% by mid-2024, a number that’s been steadily climbing thanks to a strong demand from tenants and comparatively lower property prices.
For Americans, especially those used to high costs of cities like New York or San Francisco, Lisbon feels more attainable. High demand, fewer regulatory headaches than other European cities, and a booming tourism industry mean landlords can see real profits. Compared to places like Berlin or Paris, where acquisition costs are steep and rental rules are tight, Lisbon feels more accessible.
Why are Americans moving to Portugal?
Portugal has been quietly climbing the ranks as a destination for Americans looking to relocate, and the momentum is unmistakable. Google searches about “how to move to Portugal” increased by +1100% since 5 November 2024, with more Americans considering relocation than ever before.
This isn’t just a fad. Between January and June of this year, over a million U.S. tourists visited Portugal — a 15% jump from 2023. Meanwhile, the number of Americans living in Portugal grew by 44% last year, reaching over 14,000 by mid-2024. Many are drawn by the promise of a more affordable, slower-paced life.
And for Californians in particular, Portugal feels familiar. The weather is sunny, the coastline is stunning, and the lifestyle is relaxed. But unlike California, Portugal’s cost of living doesn’t break the bank.
Lisbon’s appeal for property investors
Lisbon is more than just a great place to live; it’s a smart place to invest. Tourism is booming, and short-term rental platforms have made it easy for property owners to turn their homes into income-generating assets. That said, this growth hasn’t come without challenges. The demand for rentals has pushed up prices, inciting debate about housing affordability for locals.
Despite this, property experts predict that Lisbon will remain a favorite for investors. Its location, climate, and quality of life make it instant draws for those looking to move abroad. The key for the future will be finding a balance between attracting investors and ensuring affordable housing for everyone.

This isn’t exactly a restaurant review. There are a few reasons why it would never qualify. First, I never knew the name of the restaurant in question. It wasn’t on the outside of the place, and while it was on the menu I don’t speak Portuguese. I don’t even know if the place is still in business. It was 2015 and I was in Lisbon.
The trip was crazy, I was in Lisbon for three days, Madrid for three days, Barcelona for Three days, and Paris for three days. This was day two in Lisbon, after spending a day in Sintra exploring castles.
Lisbon was a new experience for me. I’d travelled a fair bit before, but never to somewhere with that kind of history. Canada doesn’t have a lot of historical buildings. Nothing that goes back more than a few hundred years and even that tends to be historical sites, important buildings, that sort of thing. The other places I’d travelled had, up until that point, been the US, South America, and the South Pacific. None of them have really old buildings that are still in use. Lisbon had houses in the city older than the oldest buildings in Canada and they were still in use. The Airbnb I was staying in was in a courtyard that predates confederation in Canada. The whole neighbourhood was like that.

I was lucky enough to get back to Lisbon (Lisboa) recently. I can’t get enough of the city, especially in the off season when it’s not overrun with tourists and global nomads looking for a tasty caipirinha or port in Bairro Alto and an evening of Fado in Alfama. I return to Lisboa for both too, but I also visit to ride the Metro and the trams and consider how a hilly city reminiscent of San Francisco gets people around.
As in Madrid and other European capitals, my transit envy for Lisbon always starts with the Metropolitano (Metro) de Lisboa right outside the airport terminals, as it should be.
The ease and comfort of riding the Metro with its cork appointed seats, comes in
contrast to my slog to JFK on an often old A train from Harlem to Lefferts and Liberty, followed by the Q10 Bus to the AirTrain.
Sure, I know I can save a few minutes by taking the A to Howard Beach or the E or LIRR to Jamaica and getting on the AirTrain ($8.25), but why would I? I’d rather budget more time for the trip and buy a couple of Trinidadan doubles for dinner with the money I save making my ride a single fare OMNY trip.
It is rare to get jostled on the Metro in Lisboa the way one might in New York. And getting on and off a crowded train is not the hassle it can be at rush hour on the A or E, or any of our trains for that matter.
Lisboa isn’t a massive city like New York or Los Angeles but like so many global cities I have gotten to know over the years, it seems to have figured out how to match its transit with its commuters’ needs and the city’s often steep topography. Take the romantic trams (amarelos da Carris) that climb up and down Lisboa’s narrow, winding streets. As with the New Orleans streetcars, San Francisco’s cable cars and L.A’s Angels Flight, one doesn’t have to be a transit lover to swoon over these trams.
Of course the Lisboa Metro and the trams aren’t perfect or service as frequent on some lines as it needs to be. One night, heading back to my Airbnb in Arroios, I couldn’t help noticing how packed the train was. Like sardines, as we used to say in New York, or sardinhas, in Lisboa.
The system is also not as disability accessible as it needs to be.
Still, Lisboa and Portugal in general seem years ahead of the U.S. in building a more sustainable transportation network that won’t cost the country the arm and a leg that the Second Avenue Subway extension is going to cost us.
And transit in Lisboa is still improving and growing. The new loop to Campo de Ourique will bring trains to more Lisboetas or Alfacinhas (little lettuces) as Lisboa residents are called.
The dedication to transit is consistent with the country and the E.U.’s commitment to sustainability generally. Portuguese cities are places where residents routinely sort their trash and recycling and best of all, drink their coffee at home or in a café, rather than out of a togo cup.
It was great to get back to Lisboa and it won’t be my last time riding the Metro. And while I am still learning the meaning of saudade, the Portuguese feeling of longing, melancholy, or nostalgia that is supposedly characteristic of the Portuguese temperament, who doesn’t love an airport with bike parking!
Yours in transit,
Joel

I understand in some places of the world, having a car is a must for getting around. Although Lisbon doesn’t fall into that category.
And since I see many people asking if they should rent a car when coming here. I felt like writing this.
So…
Is it worth renting a car when visiting Lisbon?
To honestly answer this question it’s better if you understand a few things beforehand.
Let’s start with the basics.
Why do you need a car?
Are you used to having one available at all times, and you see it as a luxury you can’t let go of? Is there a genuine necessity?
Which area of the city are you staying in, and how do you plan to utilize the car?
For how long will you be in Lisbon? What about Portugal in general?

One month in Lisbon. That’s some 90 meals. Quite a few I prepared at home. What is remarkable is how cheap fruit, vegetables, meat and fish are in Lisbon compared with Australia. Peppers and onions are sweet and cost pennies.
Tuna and Swordfish are about €12-€13 a kilo. It’s a shock to the system.
With cheaper ingredients, property and labour costs it is understandable that Portugal has plenty of quite cheap eats. I say quite cheap as Lisbon isn’t as cheap as you’d expect.
It’s partly that tax is high — 23% compared to Australia’s 10%. And partly that in the inner suburbs around the old town venues are mainly catering to tourists.
Restaurante Ponto Final
R. Ginjal 72, 2800 Almada
I’d rate this as one of the most essential Lisbon experiences together with its rooftop bars. I was recommended it by my old blogging friend Gill. And boy was it good, rustic, generous local dishes in a superb location.
We went for deep fried fish (of some sardine variation), a big bowl of beans with a fishcake -one pot could feed at least two — and a variety of other snacks and wine.
It’s a short ferry hop from Cais do Sodré to Cacilhas and then a 1km walk along a mostly abandoned and graffitied wharf to the restaurant. My only regret is that we didn’t return here.
Open daily 10am-12am
Av. 24 de Julho 49, Portugal Mainly catering to tourists, the Time Out Market is open all day every day and is worth visiting on Sunday and Monday nights in particular when many other restaurants are closed. It has a curated section of high profile local chefs with some stalls doing great value menu do dia.
You can try traditional local dishes such as prego rolls (steak sandwiches, braised ox cheek, bacaloa, pulvo (octopus) and croquetas at the various stalls. You can buy the amazing local Portuguese cheeses, ham, tinned goods, custard tarts and pastries. There’s also sushi, pizza, ice cream.
Seating probably 1,000 people it is a huge space with a really lively buzz. If you can’t decide what to eat, Time Out market will be no help because it will present you with so many choices.
There is a market next door with greengrocers, fish mongers and butchers.
Mon — Thu 10:00–23:00, Fri — Sun 10:00–01:00
106, R. Coelho da Rocha 104, Lisboa
This mercado is the Prahran Market of Lisbon though the focus is more about eating than shopping. It’s got plenty of steak and burger bars. In addition to others doing fish, ceviche and more. It’s a bit more pricy than the Time Out market and has less choice. It’s still fun though.
Saturday mornings
Jardim do Príncipe Real This is the local farmers market. You can buy wine, sensational cheese, ham and fruit and veg. I bought an amazing local bread, heavy enough to sink a blogger. There are also a selection of food stalls where you can eat. It’s worth a Saturday morning stroll here and a coffee at the local kiosk.
R. Dom Pedro V 129, 1250–096 Lisboa
I’ve already said it’s worth stopping for a large G&T or a pisco sour here. It’s also one of the hottest restaurants in town with terrific local variations on ceviche. Arrive early or make a booking.
NB: Don’t order the NZ sauvignon blanc!
R. António Maria Cardoso 58, 1200–330 Lisboa
At first I thought I’d jumped back a decade at Mini Bar as a Ferran Adria Spherified Olive (2004) was delivered. But perhaps that was just my food nerdiness. The food and drink is good and is a diversion from the traditional rustic fare. The menu took us through an excellent selection of curated wines and tapas-style dishes with Japanese influences. There was tiny ice cream cone with sashimi; a single ceviche of prawn served on a lime that you bite into; chicken skin tapas; tuna tataki. Overall this was one of the best dining experiences in Lisbon. Owner José Avillez — a local has other Lisbon restaurants all nearby — Belcanto, Cantinho do Avillez, Café Lisboa, and Pizzaria Lisboa.
R. Duques de Bragança 5, Lisboa
The crust is thin…really thin on these pricy pizzas.
Rua de O Século 242, Lisboa
Recommended by our Airbnb host, Tascardo is very local and great value. I had the steak in a garlic sauce with a fried egg on top. Pam was surprised that the squid came complete with innards and beak. It’s tasty and rustic — as is most Portuguese food.
R. Nova do Almada 95, 1200–288 Lisboa Eventually you will crave vegetables. I mean back home do you only eat meat, fish and potatoes? No. This place, off Lisbon’s main shopping strip, does healthy salads. Top up on vegetables here.
Portugal, R. das Portas de Santo Antão 136, 1150–265 Lisboa  A grungy cafe doing Australian-style coffee and food. Worth a diversion.
Bengal Tandoori Lisboa
Rua da Alegria 23, Lisbon 1250–005
Curry in Lisbon? Why not. After all the Portuguese introduced chillis to India and led to the invention of vindaloo, a sour, hot curry containing pork. From savoury (and sweet for dessert) samosas to vindaloo this is a serious curry shop. You’ll need to navigate windy narrow back streets past a few rowdy African bars.
LX Factory
R. Rodrigues de Faria 103, 1300 Lisboa
Mainly burger joints and interesting reclaimed industrial buildings with various boutiques.

In November of 2017, I attended the Launch in Lisbon program and WebSummit. By the end of that trip, at a stylish and endearingly gritty aftertparty at the Hub Criativo Beato, I declared that I would be moving to Lisbon.
Now that I live here, people often ask why I picked Lisbon instead of a more obvious tech hub. It’s not a simple answer, and I get asked this question enough times that I decided to write this article about it:
I first visited Lisbon in the Spring of 2017 when I was attending several startup events across the EU, including cities such as London, Berlin, Milan, and Zurich. Lisbon was actually my stopover on the way to London; I had eight hours and one local friend to show me a preview of the city. We walked through some of the city’s many scenic areas and had lunch overlooking the river and the 25 de Abril Bridge on a bright sunny day — Lisbon is known for its unique light, among other things. With my extra time I wandered the streets and had a casual meeting at Startup Lisboa to talk about their incubator program. There was something relaxed, warm and inviting about that meeting that left an impression on me as I left to visit other European cities.
In the US there was ongoing political tension and a degradation of values such as Net Neutrality (a free and open internet) and data privacy. I realized that launching a startup in the streaming video space would be more challenging and prone to failure in an already risky field. After researching the major European tech hubs, making several spreadsheets, and visiting startup community events, I was still not sure where it would make sense to base myself out of. So after considering the logical factors, I let all of that go and instead tuned into how I felt physically and emotionally in each city. The memories of the first hours in Lisbon kept appearing, and that was enough to justify the fateful trip where I made the decision.
Lisbon wants foreigners to come and build their companies here. They see new technology startups and even new companies with traditional business models as a way to grow their economy, and they are investing in that.
Lisbon offers a combination of loans and grants through its Portugal 2020 program, where you can receive 0% interest loans for almost half of your company’s initial operating costs without sacrificing any equity. There are also government-sponsored incubators such as Startup Lisboa (full disclosure: I am now in the Startup Lisboa program and a recipient of Portugal 2020 program so I’m totally biased), where you can have an adorable office in downtown Lisbon and mentorship services for a very small monthly cost. I used to have a discounted “hot desk” at a coworking space in New York and now, for the same price, I have an office that can fit four people with a view of a building with azulejos (those pretty tiles associated with Lisbon) and a small balcony where I can see the Tejo river.
The costs for administrative activities and employees is also lower compared to Western Europe and most of the US, but to be fair, I should point out that those costs will increase in the next few years as the Portuguese economy matures and more tech companies more here for “nearshoring” (yes, that’s a thing). Because of the lower operating costs, I am able to bootstrap for a longer period of time and achieve more milestones before giving away equity for investment
Portugal is a crossroads between Europe, the Americas and Africa, and the Lusophone (network of portuguese speaking countries) even extends to some parts of South and East Asia. Why does this matter? Aside from business reasons, it helps Lisbon and Portugal to break away from homogeneous thinking. The LGBT, creative, and entrepreneurial communities often intersect and result in social and cultural amenities that are usually reserved for larger cities.
Portugal’s legendary hospitality and diversity are also a factor that helps Portugal earn the ranking with of best quality of life for expats in the world and helps Lisbon consistently place in the Monocle annual Quality of Life survey. And in the startup scene itself, it lends to a more collaborative, supportive environment rather than a competitive mentality.
Maybe it’s because Portugal and the UK are in the same timezone and have had a peace treaty for over 600 years. It could also be because Portugal’s population is 10.3 million (somewhere between the populations of New Jersey and Pennsylvania) and they don’t expect the world to learn their language. Regardless of the reason, the Portuguese tend to speak really good English. The younger population and tech professionals are almost always fluent. Being a native English speaker is an advantage here, and learning basic Portuguese is sincerely appreciated, but not mandatory.
I’m surprised that the Portuguese speak English with an accent that often sounds more American than British. They tell me that it is because they don’t dub their films and they watch a lot of US TV shows on Netflix.
Also, I should note that many Portuguese people speak three or more languages — usually English, French, Spanish or German in addition to their native tongue. They do not have the same linguistic reputation as the Swiss, but I think they deserve this acknowledgment.
Launching a company in countries with larger populations and strong domestic economies can cause a company to think about only the local market. That doesn’t work very well for a tech startup with global ambitions. In Portugal’s case, they expect you to focus on external markets as soon as you can. And the government has an internationalization program with grants to help you market to other countries.
As I stated previously, Portugal is a crossroads, an international hub that connects to other global markets and cultures despite its relatively small size.
Lisbon is a startup hub that is not held back by old paradigms.
Berlin, London and Paris: they are wonderful places and have thriving startup scenes. But they all have a preconceived notion and a reputation that is hard to change. Lisbon doesn’t have this burden; Lisbon is creating something new, experimenting and evolving as it discovers its niche. The creative class and digital nomads often come from interesting and wealthy countries and choose to move to Lisbon after seeing many parts of the world.
I’ve heard that Portugal is described as the “New California” and Lisbon is the new San Francisco of Europe. I don’t know if I agree with that assessment but I do imagine that Lisbon has the potential to be a futuristic Starfleet Headquarters-type place. A center of innovation, creativity and a place that embodies the human rights and data policies that were outlined in the Treaty of Lisbon. And I think Lisbon has a strong chance of being associated with new media.
Like many startup founders, I might be extra optimistic and biased. I might fail and Lisbon might not reach its potential. But there is a spirit here that continuously encourages me to embrace Lisbon, and Lisbon has already displayed its ongoing level of commitment to me.
Michael Fiorentino is the Founder of Vixtape, which is building a streaming TV service that combines audio, video and data in new ways. He will have a booth at WebSummit and will be VJing several unofficial night events that week in Barrio Alto, Principe Real and Marvila.

If you’re planning a summer holiday, why choose between city or beach? Come to sunny Lisbon and have both!
You find beaches for all tastes around Lisbon. Here’s your ultimate Lisbon beach guide to the main and easily accessible areas.
50 km northwest of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
This quaint fishing village became a Europe’s top surf spot and is one of the four World Surfing Reserves. Its best surf breaks include Ribeira d’Ilhas, Coxos and Pedra Branca. Its Atlantic coastline has a handful of unspoiled beaches great to relax and spend some family time, like Foz do Lizandro and São Lourenço. During the summer, it comes alive with locals and tourists and there’s no shortage of beach accommodation, surf schools and lodges, nightlife spots and seafood restaurants.
30 km northwest of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
This UNESCO site town is widely known for its dream-like palaces. However, north of town and included in a protected area, near picturesque villages with local restaurants serving delicious food you find beaches loved for their wilderness and natural beauty. Adraga, Grande and Maçãs are amongst the best beaches near Sintra.
30 km west of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
In the Portuguese Riviera more than ten Blue Flag beaches have something for everyone — family fun, water sports and great spots for surfing and sports alike. Tamariz and Carcavelos are some of the best-known, and there’s the wild Guincho, a world’s top windsurf location. There are hip surf hostels and schools galore, Europe’s biggest casino, top-class beach hotels and golf resorts. These are the beaches most easily accessible from Lisbon and can get busy during the summer.
15 km south of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports.
Portugal’s longest strip of sand spreads over 30 km with beaches facing the Atlantic fresh waters. Apart from endless space for sunbathing, you find a variety of watersports including surfing, kitesurfing, windsurfing and scuba-diving, as well as schools and hostels. Affordable seafood, lively beach bars and summer parties complete the scenery for a fantastic sunny time with sand between your toes. During the summer, a small train takes you along 10 km of beaches. As for the other 20 km, car is the best option. The further south you go, the wilder it gets and the fewer people you find. It’s also home to one of the earliest nudist beaches around the capital — Meco.
40 km south of Lisbon easily reached by car or public transports
This picturesque fishing town is home to long strips of sand facing calm waters. It’s a popular amongst locals, mainly families attracted by the quiet waters of the sheltered bays. Although it became a popular summer resort known for it beach hotels and fresh seafood restaurants, it retains its fishing atmosphere — you can still see the fishermen selling the day’s catch. Located at the mouth of the Sado River, the sea is rich in fish, being one of the best sport-fishing spots around Lisbon. Amongst its most sought after beaches are Califórnia and Ouro.
45 km south of Lisbon easily reached by car.
The scenery is something you’ll never forget about Arrábida’s beaches — the perfect combination of golden sand, green cliffs, and blue sea.
A natural park covering 108 km2 is home to peaceful sandy coves. Its calm blue waters and the diversity of marine life make it one of the best spots for snorkelling and scuba-diving in Portugal. Its sea caves are also an opportunity for those who enjoy caving and diving. Portinho da Arrábida and Figueirinha are its most famous beaches. If you’re a seafood fan, there are excellent and affordable restaurants.
55km south of Lisbon easily reached by car/ferryboat
This peninsula inspires anyone with its magnificent landscape, formed by the Arrábida green mountains, the Sado estuary and miles of unspoiled dunes. Its long beaches and the calm transparent waters are ideal for families, like the Tróia-mar beach. For a break from the sand, there are tours to watch dolphins playing in the sea, watersports and beachfront resorts with tennis courts and golf courses. A casino and superb seafood restaurants complete the picture, making it a top-notch beach destination. Just count with prices above the average.
70km south of Lisbon easily reached by car/ferryboat
In the small village of Comporta things are as simple as long swathes of sand and calm waters sheltered by dunes and pinewoods. In a protected area that impresses by its natural beauty and wildlife, you find a beach that goes by the same name with everything for a tranquil summer holiday and an invigorating contact with nature. There are golf courses and excellent conditions for bird watching, or you can just take a seaside stroll or hop on a horse for a different view of the sands. You can choose from affordable places to eco-friendly villas and house retreats with a touch of luxury. One thing is sure — compared with Tróia it’s much natural and quieter.

Even before the pandemic, many people, particularly US citizens, have been looking to move somewhere that offered a better quality of life. One of the main criteria is it must be safe, and on the surface Portugal appears to be a good option. Nobody gets killed at school by rampaging gunmen, the country isn’t always at war, or threatening war, and most people aren’t openly aggressive towards people of colour. So, what’s to worry about?
The question of how we learn about the practicalities of immigrating to a new country critically depends on the scope of your enquiries. How deep do you go and how do you rate the sources you use to draw conclusions? My husband and I, both sociologists and writers, lived in Lisbon for three and a half years. We had travelled there several times before and already had a few Portuguese friends before we decided to move. We didn’t speak much Portuguese but it wasn’t our first time starting life in a new country where we didn’t speak the language. We did everything ourselves, there was no relocation agent, and we knew obtaining accommodation, dealing with bureaucracy and getting settled would require patience and a lot of energy. Even having a relocation agent doesn’t count for much, because once you’re settled, the problems don’t end there.

If Portugal invented bureaucracy, Mozambique made it smoke a joint and forget why it walked into the room.
I’ve danced with the bureaucratic devils in both countries — Portugal with its deadly seriousness and love of obscure forms, and Mozambique with its spectacular improvisation, where systems are more suggestion than structure. Neither place is designed to facilitate getting things done. They take different approaches to the art of not getting there.
Let’s start in Portugal. Bureaucracy here is like an elaborate board game where no one explains the rules, the dice are missing, and halfway through, someone switches the language to Legalese. You show up with everything you were told to bring, plus a few extras (because you’ve been burned before). The clerk glances at your papers, sighs, and says you’re missing a Declaração de Existência, a certificate proving you still exist — and no, your breathing presence isn’t proof enough.
Everything must be official. Preferably signed and ideally stamped. A document without a stamp is like a Portuguese coffee without sugar: technically functional, but deeply unsatisfying to the authorities.
Now, contrast this with Mozambique. I spent years navigating state offices, where everything takes longer, but somehow no one is in a rush. Want a driving licence? That’ll take weeks. Maybe months. Possibly a goat. You learn to bring your pen, paper, and, ideally, someone who knows someone. In Mozambique, the system is more about who you know than what you know or even what you need.
There, it’s less paperwork and more social performance. A good handshake and a wide smile can accelerate a process faster than a notarised form. People nod solemnly, take your papers, disappear into the back for what feels like a pilgrimage, then return and say: “Come back tomorrow. Maybe.”
I once went to collect a simple residency document in Maputo. The office had no electricity, but a woman behind a desk was still diligently stamping papers. I asked how she was managing. She lifted the stamp, thudded it onto a blank form, and said: “We stamp first. Later, we figure out what it was for.”
Efficiency? No. But creativity? Absolutely.
In Portugal, the power lies with the rules. In Mozambique, power lies with the person holding the stamp pad — usually someone sipping tea behind a dusty desk who may or may not be in today, depending on the weather, the fuel supply, or their cousin’s wedding.
Portugal loves the illusion of control. Everything is digital now… sort of. There’s a national portal, multiple logins, security codes sent by SMS, and inevitably, a crash right when you need it most. You try to upload a form, and the system tells you the document is too large — it’s a one-page PDF. You call the helpline, and they suggest using Internet Explorer in 2025.
Meanwhile, in Mozambique, the system has already crashed weeks ago. The printer doesn’t work. The person who knew the password is on leave. But someone will eventually scrawl your details in a giant ledger with the confidence of a 16th-century monk, and you’ll leave with a semi-official-looking slip of paper, possibly signed with a Bic pen and blessed by chaos.
The difference is in tone. Portuguese bureaucracy takes itself very seriously. Everything must be done properly, even when it doesn’t work. Especially then. In Mozambique, no one pretends the system works. It’s acknowledged with a laugh, a shrug, and a story.
And maybe that’s the heart of it. In Portugal, the system is king, cold, stubborn, and demanding. In Mozambique, the system is a rumour, and the people are the real structure holding everything together. That may sound romantic, but it also means nothing is predictable, and everything is negotiable.
So, which is worse? Honestly, it depends on the day. In Portugal, I leave the office frustrated but eventually successful, clutching my over-stamped document like a war medal. In Mozambique, I leave smiling, document-free, and slightly unsure what just happened — but someone offered me cashew nuts and called me mana.
Different brands of chaos. Same familiar headache.
If you enjoyed this tangled tale, stick around. There’s plenty more where this came from — with laughs, insights, and a few more hair-raising adventures on life, parenting, work, and everything in between.

I wasn’t sure I wanted to go. We’ve been to many ruined castles before. It’s just walls, right?
Castelo de São Jorge is pretty much at the top of Lisbon, the city of seven hills, with a steep climb required to reach it. On top of it all, it is scorching in the middle of July — do we really want to go?
In the end, what decided it was that we arrived on a Monday. And most Lisbon museums are closed on Mondays.
We didn’t know — one of the gaps in our research — and didn’t have alternate plans ready.
Another factor was that it was open until 9 pm, and we could be there at sunset. We were jet lagged and needed to crash first, and then find something not too demanding to do at the end of our first day.
We set off around 6:30 pm, following Google’s directions along the twisted and meandering streets. There was a free elevator (Elevador Castelo) about halfway point which allowed us to gain a bit of altitude without climbing. We got there closer to 7 pm — and stayed until the end because it was just spectacular.

On my request, my VA compiled a list of museums in and around Lisbon for me. The Museu de Marinha (in Belem) is free on the 1st Sunday of every month (which today, Oct 1, happens to be) so I decided to check it out. I did pay the extra for the temporary exhibition Vikings although it wasn’t as educational or even as entertaining as I expected it to be so I don’t recommend it. In fact, if you have a Netflix subscription, watch the series Vikings (its gruesome and probably inaccurate but definitely entertaining)
As for the Museu de Marinha itself, I highly recommend it. Here are some of my random thoughts and photographs of the visit.
The entrance itself is impressive with a tall ceiling of many (probably unnecessary) arches. Beneath it sits a statue of Prince Henry (Infante D. Henrique) who is credited with launching the Age of Discoveries for Portugal.
There’s also a giant map behind him of the Portuguese exploration. Naturally, I was curious about their conquest of Goa so I zoomed in for a closer look.
According the the map, there’s a route taken by Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500 from Portugal to Brazil, then past the Cape of Good Hope onwards to the East Coast of Africa and finally Goa. Vasco da Gama it seems, went straight to Cochin. Some day soon I will research more about these sea routes.
The museum has a large variety of ship models progressing from charming early 14th century merchant ships all the way to the less-impressive 21st century destroyer ships and submarines.
It was a bit disappointing to see the transition of ships as vessels of exploration and commerce into vessels of war over the years.
I did however find a small label in the exhibit that mentioned the “myth” of the School of Sagres.
Since I had never heard of this School before, I believe the myth even more now.
(hint: This could be the start of a great Dan Brown novel)
If you like Museums and you’re in/around Lisbon, here’s the map i referred to earlier with information about free days and museum timings. Feel free to use and share.
Also, completely irrelevant yet important — if you have a problem remembering and managing your passwords for your 50+ online accounts, here’s a solution that I’ve been using for over 3 years now and can’t live without. It’s called Dashlane and if you use my referral link here you will get $20 off your Premium subscription (there’s also a free version)

Kanazawa opens everyday for dinner. On a good day, it sits eight customers. On a bad day too. How a tiny restaurant with pricey menus, slow service and a strict reservation policy is challenging its industry’s dogmas.
Tomoaki Kanazawa started cooking in 1985. In 1993 he was invited by the Japanese Ambassador in Portugal to come to Lisbon as the Embassy Chef. Years later he opened his own restaurant, Tomo, that would become a reference in traditional Japanese cuisine in Lisbon.
However, Tomoaki wasn’t happy. He believed that when customers visited his restaurant they should feel as if they were eating at someone’s home but, because he was serving over 100 meals at lunch and dinner, he couldn’t spare a minute to be with them, so he couldn’t provide them with that kind of experience. So he took a bold step: he left Tomo to his employees and, together with his wife Kayo and his daughter Sakura, he opened Kanazawa, the 8 seat restaurant that set up a whole new standard for high end cuisine in Lisbon and may well become a business case study.
1. You can make customers work for your product
Kanazawa’s first management lesson is that you don’t need to make your customers’ lives easy, what you need is to have a product they want so badly they will work hard to get.
The waiting list is months-long. When I was there in November, I overheard a fellow customer saying that he was trying to make a reservation since August. Not only that, but the booking experience is in itself a challenge. You can’t book a table over the phone, the reservations are to be made online. After providing your contact information, you must select three alternative dates for your visit. Then, you have to confirm that you agree with the cancellation policy, which states that, if you cancel your reservation in the 3 day-period prior to the confirmed date, you will pay a cancellation fee, which starts at 60% of the price of the menu if you cancel 3 days before and rises up to 100% if you cancel on the same day. After confirming your agreement, your credit card number is requested, which is to ensure that, if you actually decide to cancel within that 3-day period, the fee is credited from your account.
Finally, you must choose one of the four different menus, prices ranging from 60€ to 150€. It is almost impossible to grasp the differences between the menus, as the dishes names are in Japanese and there are no pictures to illustrate them. Calling the restaurant won’t work either (I tried), as the language barrier is there too. My very simple solution for this complex problem was to google every dish on each menu, go over the available pictures, and create a global understanding of what to expect.
This extenuating process sends a strong message to the customer: The restaurant is opening for eight people only, and you are one of them. From the moment we accept your reservation, we are deeply committed to provide you with the best experience we can create. Make sure to honor your commitment too. It might sound harsh, but it is easy to understand if you refer back to Tomoaki’s vision: when you visit his restaurant you should feel as if you were eating at his home. So think about it, if you were invited to an 8-guest dinner party at a friend’s place and he was counting on you to bring the wine, would you lightly cancel on the same day?
2. You can invest time on your customers
Kanazawa’s second management lesson is that time spent preparing and delivering a personalized experience to your customers is never — ever — wasted.
When I arrived at Kanazawa, Kayo took my coat and showed me where I was supposed to sit. While I was seating I was stunned to notice that there was a small, handwritten name tag with my name on it, right next to a line-up of the courses, also handwritten, with that day’s date on it. It is a small gesture that immediately makes you feel special and welcome. Someone took the time to write this for me, I thought.
The eight seats are placed around the sushi bar. Tomoaki served the first course, calmly explaining what it was, where the ingredients came from (more on that in a second), and how to taste it. The ritual is repeated every time a new course is served. Even though he alternates between groups of customers, he is able to make each group feel unique, as if he was there just for them.
At Kanazawa desserts are cooked by Kayo, so she takes over when the time comes to serve and explain them. She goes individually to each group and speaks in a really soft, delicate manner, that somehow makes you feel all the careful dedication that was put into each of the tiny portions of cake, mousse and ice-cream, all made from local ingredients. She then brings in a small portion of handmade candy, served in a mirrored-plate and accompanied by the tiniest origami I’ve ever seen (someone did this for me, I thought). Before leaving, you still get a package of homemade cookies to take home.
The whole service is perfectly adapted to the rhythm of each group, as if someone was keeping an attentive eye to make sure that you would neither be rushed nor have to wait too long. This probably has something to do with the fact that Tomoaki designed the whole experience based on the Japanese tea ceremony inspired by Sen no Rikyu. I arrived at Kanazawa at 8.30pm and left at 11.30pm, feeling that it was still 9.30pm, just like would have happened if I was having dinner at some old friend’s place. Tomoaki and his family spent 3 hours of their evening with me. And I can’t wait to go back.
3. You can work with your family
Kanazawa’s third management lesson is that working with your family doesn’t have to be a tense experience for all of those involved — it can actually be quite peaceful.
If you’ve ever watched or read about Netflix’s Chef’s Table, you know that family plays a big part in Chefs’ careers. Families can either be the solid foundation or the constant source of pressure, questioning, and regret for great Chefs around the world.
Kanazawa employs three people, and they are all related. You might expect that this simple fact could in itself result in a not so simple work dynamics, but that is not the case — at all. In fact, all the processes and rituals are so well coordinated among Tomoaki, Kayo and Sakura that you barely hear them speak to each other. Or get into each other’s space. Sakura mostly helps her father in the kitchen, but she doesn’t need to be told what to do. She just knows the rhythm and plays according to it. She moves graciously at precise moments. Kayo works her way around customers, picking up finished courses, delivering new tableware, serving tea, so discretely that you can barely hear her steps. It’s almost as if they are dancing a secret family dance. You don’t know the moves but it is just beautiful to watch.
Their working choreography not only looks peaceful from the outside, it actually makes you feel calm and relaxed, as when you visit a couple of friends at their place and they naturally take turns going to the kitchen to prepare the meal, just to make sure that you are not left alone in the living room. One of them is always keeping you company. That’s how you feel at Kanazawa too.
4. You can buy from local vendors
Kanazawa’s fourth management lesson is that it is possible to run a successful business making it a principle to buy from small local vendors.
Tomoaki not only selects Portuguese fish for his restaurant, he makes sure that each species’ origin is well-known to the customers. One of the highest moments of the dining experience comes when he opens up a wood box containing different fish species, perfectly cut and prepared, and talks in great detail about the provenience and seasonality of each of them, so that the customer can make a well informed choice about the nigiris he should prepare. Most of the vegetables and fruits used have Portuguese roots too. What his suppliers have in common, beyond the nationality, is the compromise towards sustainable production.
This is one direct consequence of Kanazawa’s very unique operating model. Working in a 100-seat restaurant means preparing food three or four days in advance. You don’t actually know how many people will come (even those who made a reservation can cancel or simply don’t show up) and what they will eat, so you need to have a huge stock in place and proceed with as much setting up as possible. Tomoaki, on the other hand, not only has eight customers per night, but he also knows beforehand what they will be eating and he can be quite sure that they will come. So he can focus on preparing the best — not the cheapest nor the fastest — meal his customers can have, and he can buy fresh ingredients and source them locally.
Isn’t that what anyone who has guests over does? Buying ingredients from a market or supermarket that is trustworthy and close to home and preparing the meal just before the guests arrive? If you’ve ever been in the host position, you know how good it feels to look for and cook the best ingredients you can find. But as a guest, you also know how good it feels to have a simple but thoughtful meal put together just for you. And this is where Tomoaki’s brilliance reveals itself once again: you feel that, by putting all this focus in looking for the best ingredients, he is concerned with putting a thoughtful meal together for you.
All in all, Kanazawa’s main take-away lesson for business is this: if you have a strong vision for your product, invest your time on crafting and delivering a personalized experience for your customers, create a safe and calm working environment, and stay true to your principles, you can focus on what really matters, which is to turn your work into a permanent state of passion.

Lisbon… I have arrived to this wonderful city two years ago and fell in love with it at the first glance. Lisbon was like my beloved man, like my lover and my soulmate who was waiting for me for all his life, waiting patiently for me to come. I remember that wonderful day in April 2013, I remember that moment when the plane was about to land and my knees started to shiver….. I had a strange feeling that I am coming home but not going for a vacation to an amazing country with a very old and rich history. And I guess I was right…… because 2 years later (as I was coming back over and over again to see my beloved Lisbon) I have relocated here.
I love this city and this amazing country for its marvellous landscapes, incredible beaches, breath-taking nature, magnificent sunsets and wonderful sky. Yes, sky. If you have travelled a lot I bet you noticed that sky and clouds in every country are different. But if you have been to Portugal at least once you will never forget its sky, because you will not be able to find something like that in any other place. I would like to share with you my impressions and experience from the places I have visited in Portugal, about the beauty of this country, its history, its architecture and its magnificent charisma, yes charisma because Portugal for me is not just a country, it is like a lifetime partner who is always happy with you, for you and feels saudade (beautiful juicy Portuguese word which actually has no direct translation but describes a deep emotional state of nostalgia for something or someone you really love, e.g. your motherland or beloved person, something important and significant) when you leave it.
For many years it was a forgotten city. It endured a very long dictatorship; and later it accumulated errors of urban planning. :) Nowadays Lisbon is a city with an odd geography comprising different villages, connected by a incomprehensible system of streets, alleys, lanes, travessas (small, narrow but very cosy streets) abandoned tram lines. Perhaps it is the city where it is impossible to make plans at all; because the city grabs you, hugs you and whispers to your ears lots of crazy ideas even if you have strict plans and you need to stick to them. You might have a walk downtown because you have an appointment there with a friend or a lesson of Portuguese language close to Rua Augusta but then… suddenly you just make a turn to the street you haven’t been before to grab a coffee and suddenly beauty of new unknown street devours you completely, you call your friend and ask to join you immediately or you give a call to language school to reschedule the lesson because now you have to explore the beauty you haven’t seen before. And this is a way much more important than studying. :)
Lisbon loves you a lot, you feel this love, you swim at it, and you feel it with your heart, your skin, your fingertips and your soul. Lisbon hugs you and whispers wonderful words to your ears, he sings fado (incredibly beautiful traditional music and songs in Lisbon, which refers to saudade as originally fado are songs about loss and missing something important) for you, he offers you amazing food, and you feel overwhelmed with this city. That is how I felt from the very first minute I have spent in Lisbon. If you come here once and stay for living you realise that in this city you live like the days were never-ending and Lisbon is a boyfriend who does not forgive your absence. Because today you need to be in Gulbenkian museum because the new exhebition is just starting, and at the same day there is a wonderful indie rock band performing in Bairro Alto, and tomorrow you need to wake up early because you have classes but you have no time to study at all because this city offers so many things every day. You need to go to that new restaurant of seafood which has just opened downtown, then your friend has a launch of a book, then you were thinking of going to Alfama and making some great photos, and finally your friend from Germany is calling and saying that she has a day off and you need to go to Carcavelos for surfing. And you have so many things to do, which you REALLY need to do and you have an early morning yoga class. BUT, You cannot resist this city and you are never tired of all the activities he offers you and you cannot refuse all this as you might offend him. But your love for it is so huge and you need to be there for this city all the time so you just flow with it and its rythm.

Lisboa
Is a trip to Lisbon complete without a taste of Natas? or a trip to the Pena Palace? or a visit to the Tower of Belem popularly referred to by the locals as the Torre de Belem? I could go on and on because there is just so much to do in Lisbon in two days, which was all the time we had to spend there.
The visit to Lisbon, Portugal was a short and sweet one, with my oldest friend of 22 years. We spent the first night having a fancy dinner at the Tivoli restaurant (I recommend this restaurant, the service and food were amazing) on Liberdade avenue. Also on Liberdade avenue, you will find many name brand stores, as well as other 5-star hotels.
On the first day, we did a Lisbon city tour through a one hour Tuk Tuk ride. Frankly, I sometimes think this is a better option compared to the hop on hop off buses because of the intimacy and flexibility it offers. We rode through the Alfama district, stopped by the highest viewpoints in Lisbon for a phenomenal aerial view of the city. We went past the Cathedral church of Lisbon where several wedding ceremonies are conducted at once during the San Antonio Festival in June. We also went past the famous Cristiano Ronaldo Bistro and Bar, a stop for a drink at the bar would have been nice, but that did not happen.

I arrived in Lisbon a little over one month ago to start my Erasmus semester abroad. I had previously not visited Lisbon but had heard incredible things, so when I arrived, I wanted to see it all for myself. I couldn’t wait to get out and get active making use of the last summer days in September/October. I found myself immersed by a city full of beautiful old buildings, cobbled streets (old streets of Alfama), viewpoints (Miradouro Santa Catarina, Nossa Senhora de Monte are two favourites) and rooftop bars at sunset (Park, Topo, LX), great contemporary art (Museu Coleção Berardo) not to mention the surfing (Costa de Caparica) and most importantly the incredible nightlife here (cheap drinks in Bairro, great electronic music at Lux and a festival called Brunch). But hands down the best aspect of Erasmus is the exposure to new people, new cultures, new languages and most importantly new food!
But, me being me…I just can’t seem to ignore my keen interest in startup’s and Lisbon’s thriving ecosystems makes it even harder to ignore. Once I got confirmation of my place here at NOVA , I quickly added Web Summit to the list of ‘must-dos’ whilst here. Building on my past work at Leade.rs and VivaTech earlier this year (check out my medium profile). I am very much looking forward to being part of their Live team covering social media for this momentous event — boy do we have a task. Previously based in Dublin — 2016 was the first year Lisbon hosted the event and what an event it was…attracting 53,000 people, 15,000 companies, 7,000 CEOs and 700 investors it became Europe’s largest tech conference, and it’s poised to grow in 2017. This all demonstrates that Lisbon is not only capable but eager and yearning to establish itself on the world stage as a leader in creativity, technology, and innovation.
Paddy Cosgrove Web Summit founder put it well…‘Lisbon is like Berlin five years ago, but with a southern European climate.’
Currently Lisbon is a rising star and an underdog — ranked by Allianz as the fifth-best-performing startup community in Europe, ahead of front-runners like Stockholm and Dublin. In fact, according to Preqin, the number of VC deals closed in Lisbon 2016 jumped sixfold from 2015, delivering it’s best year yet $18.5 million spread across 9 deals. But that is just the tip of the iceberg — the Portuguese have had to make do without swaths of international investment which countries like the UK and Germany have received and that has translated into making Lisbon one of the best locations to bootstrap a startup.
One of Portugal’s main attractions is the combination of low-cost of living and high quality of life, two things that are very rarely found in one of Europe’s capital cities. On top of that, the OECD considered it the 3rd easiest country to start a company. This makes it makes it cheaper and easier to build great products utilising their highly skilled and ubiquitous talent. Fun fact: Lisbon has the highest percentage of founders with Masters or Ph.D. a whopping 82%.
Their rich history also plays its part, their Age of Discovery inspires a sense of exploration and due to Portugal’s small size; it fosters an outwardly focused mindset. It’s this very mindset which makes startups here think ‘international from day one’ giving them access to a larger addressable market, vital to startup scalability. According to the 2017 Startup Genome Report, Portuguese startups have high proportion of customers from outside Europe. A great example being F*ck Marry Kill, the gamified dating app, was founded in Lisbon but also enjoys popularity in German markets too. Furthermore, another advantage is how widespread and well spoken English is here, EF reports English proficiency at 59.68%.
Picture yourself – considering all of the above whilst relaxing in the hot summer sun after a surf on a stunning beach; sipping a caipirinha and eating some freshly caught and perfectly cooked seafood —then you know how it feels to live in Portugal.
It’s international accessibility, low cost of living and enriching lifestyle is catching ever more attention of global talent and press. All of these factors coalesce to accelerate the momentum it has recently accumulated — but to become sustainable, the ecosystem needs founders to nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs by spreading their knowledge and expertise through mentorship and re-investment.
A vital channel for mentorship, funding and networking is incubators such as, Beta-i producing 40 startups and raising more than $166million. They have worked with over 500 startups and run various acceleration programs, including Beta-start and Lisbon Challenge which attract applicants from 60 countries.
Canopy City a social impact-focused coworking space and incubator.
Impact Hub part innovation lab, part business incubator, and part community center.
BET Ventures an events company aimed at empowering entrepreneur’s.
StartUP Lisboa a government body focused on scale-up innovation. Check out their #ThisisPortugal campaign below.
Talkdesk, joined 500 startups — received 21 million dollars of investment from Salesforce.Uniplaces, a disruptive force in the student accommodation industry that started in Lisbon and has spread to 30+ European cities — raised $24 million Series A last NovemberCLICK HERE for more.
In many ways Lisbon feels like Europe’s version of San Francisco — not to mention the look-a-like Golden Gate Bridge, tanned surfers, streetcars and hills (lucky no sharks though).
Sheffield’s Universities Portuguese partner and my host university, Nova School of Business and Economics is in the unique position of having a great interface with the Lisbon startup community due to their newly opened NOVA Venture Lab, running its flagship Zero Gravity incubator/accelerator programme designed to invest in and develop innovative startups both nationally and internationally.
This innovative mindset filters into their teaching here too. In particular one of the main driving forces behind this renewed perspective and practice is Miguel Munñoz Duarte my Entrepreneurship professor and CEO of iMatch an innovation, marketing and sales focused collaborative consultancy. He has great connections to the vibrant ecosystem here and often arranges guest speakers to shine some light on the practical workings of the methodologies and techniques that we learn. A great example of this was our first guest Christian Vismara — a product manager at Build-Up Labs who came to talk to our class about his role there and specifically his work on F*ck Marry Kill.
First off, Build Up Labs is a Lisbon based Startup Studio also known as a Venture Builder — they create startups from start to finish (wherever that may be). A Venture builder is an all in one ideation, building/development, and growth house. They leverage a lean process and a cross-disciplinary team using shared resources to grow successful businesses. Think of it as the diametric opposite of ‘all your eggs in one basket’ — instead their approach is ‘put lots of eggs in different basket and nurture them until they either fly or die.’
Recently parent Startup birdie (Build Up Labs) celebrated it’s first successful hatch and fly- in other words, their first exit with NVY.LIFE to L’Oreal, it’s a beauty and lifestyle club via blog/news/app — they help readers to realise the best versions of themselves. Check it out HERE.
Christian however, talked a little more about F*ck Marry Kill (FMK) — dubbed “Tinder of the university students” by Jornal de Notícias and as the name suggests, it’s not your standard dating service it’s a game that is designed not to be taking seriously and is best at making it more fun to meet new people. They are now attracting a growing and addicted user base in Portugal and Germany too. In total, they have 72,600 users and has already registered 1.2 million hits and more than 550,000 messages sent.
tapmyback — a peer-to-peer motivation and feedback tool for teams. ToyToy a kids toy product discovery app.CLICK HERE to check out their Portfolio.
“The only thing worse than starting something and failing…is not starting.” — Seth Godin
Startup is a game of failure and if you fail, you learn and if you learn, you succeed. At Build Up Labs they strongly head the words above. Un-afraid to talk about their past mistakes they view their failures as a portfolio of experience and after all, their motto is…
“Grow fast or kill fast”
The venture building model was new and interesting to me, so after the great talk Christian gave; I approached him to find out more…I was invited to visit their office in the up-and-coming industrial end of town, Marvilla which is located in a co-working space called The Hood — I was introduced to all the members of the team; Rui Gouveia CEO, João Duarte data scientist, João Pereira and Salvador Barros, I am really excited to help develop their social profile and produce an effective strategy.
CLICK HERE to find out more about the venture building model.
Finally, I have to say that I have never felt such a strong affinity to a city, let alone the one I luckily chose to study in. There is so much to do and see and it’s impossible to tire of it. A trip to Oporto is next on the agenda.

A. interested in startup/tech/innovation
B. going to web summit C. need a social media helping hand.

Welcome to a new edition of the Tales of Ink and Light. In this one, i flip through the pages of a classic photobook and find echoes of the poetry that attracted me to Lisbon.
A decisive factor in my decision to move to Lisboa was the poetic atmosphere that i had felt while walking up and down its streets during a few short-ish stays. Often when i leave the house, i am unexpectedly reminded of that impalpable yet intensely real thing that exudes from the city.
I find it hard to define (and there is also the fact that i’d be reluctant to name it with precision, even if it were possible). It may be the colours of the walls, it may be the light, it may be a smell, it may be certain clothes people wear, it may be the sounds, it may be attitudes or certain sentences, and the river is certainly a part of it. It is these small things that suddenly appear to incarnate the soul of the place and make you think — oh, yes, indeed, i’m here, this is it. It is the sort of inescapable feeling that seems impossible to describe and that you can only understand if you’ve experienced it personally time and time again.
‘Lisbon, you know…’ is a sentence i read in a poem that appears in Lisboa, cidade triste e alegre (‘Lisbon, sad and joyful city’), a photobook that started as a series of booklets sent to subscribers by post (at the time, it was a way to circumvent the censorship of the dictatorial regime) and later rose to fame after being prominently featured in Martin Parr and Gerry Badger’s History of the Photobook. A modern facsimile edition…

I’m just back from the WebSummit in Lisbon. I had never been to Lisbon before but I’ve heard that they have great trails. As much as I’m a technerd and the WebSummit is an massive tech party with endless happenings, there was no way they were going to keep me off the trails all the week! I’ve heard the call of the trails! I contacted WERIDE and booked a full day guided ride including rental bike, at the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, approximately 25km north-west of Lisbon. I knew that I was pushing it doing a full day Enduro ride after three days of late nights and many drinks..But,
to bike or not to bike — was not even the question..
I was picked up by Hugo, the owner of WERIDE who took me to Miguel, my guide for the day. My trail monster for the day was a YT Capra with an amazing Öhlins rear shock. A Swedish rear shock for a rare Swedish guy, now that’s how you roll!
After an espresso and a Pastel de nata at the little town of Arneiro, we started the fifty minute non-stop climb up to the trailhead. It was raining and humid but the air was fresh and the surrounding forrest was green and lush. I had asked for Enduro, and enduro is what I got. No Enduro without the obligatory climbs before the fun..
The trailhead, and actually all trails in Sintra all starts next to “Tholos do Monge”, a mass grave built in the Chalcolithic period (2300 BC / 2000 BC) at the top of one of the highest elevations of the Sierra de Sintra. From the top you have a network of 25 different Enduro/HD style trails all decending down the mountains in different directions.
It is very hard to describe the Sintra forrest. It is something like a cross-over between a jungle and a Mediterranean forrest. This coupled with a misty carpet hovering a few meters above your heads turns the whole ride into a mystical-magical journey.
After a fantastic descent on the trails filled with fun obstacles, drops and flow trails, we climbed back up again to connect to another fun DH trail. I stopped counting the climbs up and down the mountain but the fantastic descents was the reward for the long climbs.
After a well deserved freshly grilled mackerel lunch at “the Bikers Refugee” in the small city of Penedo, we started the devilish climb back up to the top for our final long descent.
The Donkey trail starts at the top on Peninha, a very remote and isolated chapel overlooking the Atlantic with stunning views.
Words cannot justify the stunning views around Peninha. But best of all is the amazing descent.
After all the climbs I was ready for the long, breath taking descent to the towards the sea.
What goes up must come down. And that is a good thing!
We finished off the ride with a cold beer where we had parked. It could not have been better.
I’m glad that I took a day off the WebSummit craziness for a ride in Sintra despite being very tired from the outset. It was an amazing experience. Magical forrest, endless cool trails and a fantastic guide. I can definitely recommend to anybody who wants to ride in Portugal to contact WERIDE. These guys are pure Pros, attentive, fun and can adapt to any rider style from beginners to Pro-riders. XC, DH or Enduro, whatever makes you tick. They also know how to spice up the ride with espresso, lunch and a beer just at the right time when you really need it. They have top level, state-of-the art well serviced bikes and are very affordable, so it makes absolutely no sense to bring your own bike.
They do: half-day, full-day rides and also organize multiple days or week long rides all over Portugal. They even have their on RVs for maximum comfort for the longer rides. Enduro Magazine just came back from a couple of days with them and published this great piece.
I will definitely come back and I recommend mountain bikers who are searching for their next adventure to go and discover Portugal. You will not regret it.

We just returned from a short business trip to Lisbon with my husband. It was our first time visiting the city, and I can’t help but share this story.
We visited Lisbon right after our relocation to The Azores, San Miguel Island. It’s also Portugal but far from the mainland and is located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean but it’s another story… Since we had not visited this country before it was interesting to compare both locations, and got to know the capital of Portugal and the mentality of the locals.
The airport is right in the city, 30 minutes from the center, which is very handy and saves you time.
The old part of the city is pretty compact and no need to use transportation. It’s very nice to walk around. By the way, did you know Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world? And it’s worth the stroll, but most of the main sights in Lisbon could be seen in 2 days.
Lisbon is a relatively compact city, but it’s still a good idea to stay as centrally as possible!
Chiado and once again Chiado, and the area surrounding it!!!
It has a really wonderful, relaxed vibe. Everything is extremely close here. We were staying at 9 Hotel Mercy and were completely satisfied with the location and hotel.
If you want to save some money you can choose areas a little farther from the center such as Avenidas Novas and Alcantara — they are also good for long-term living. But in this case, you will need to use transportation.
The first thing I recommend after you leave the hotel is to have a glass of Vinho Verde — “Green wine” — which is a traditional Portuguese wine produced exclusively in the northwest of the country. It is lightly sparkling and low in alcohol. It’s really good!
Ginjinha. Trying ginjinha in Lisbon is a travel must. Actually, it’s a cherry liqueur that originated in Lisbon. A lot of bars serve ginjinha in small cups made of dark chocolate. Drinking can be fun.
Below I’ll share a list of dishes I’ve tried, of course, it could be longer, but I was only there for a few days. Plus, we had excellent breakfasts at the hotel.
Perhaps I would have started listing famous tourist attractions in the past, but it’s not so important to me now. I don’t like the fuss about it. Besides, such places are always so crowded!
Instead of visiting the famous Elevador de Santa Justa, standing in an endless line, and then in the small and stuffy elevator car (I googled and saw pictures of tourists), I’ll choose to sit in a nearby rooftop bar with a panoramic view of the same elevator and enjoy the wonderful view!!!
It’s good to read a few articles or watch a video before the trip to manage your expectations. Make a few marks on the map of places you want to visit.
I really couldn’t imagine traveling without a long list of must-see sights. But now I open up a google map with my marks on it and choose on the spot what place I want to visit depending on the mood. And that’s fine.
If I want to learn more about the city and its history, the best way to do it is to book a city tour for a few hours with a private guide who lives in this city and can share some personal stories from life.
From the beginning, it became clear that there was no point in comparing mainland Portugal and San Miguel Island. Yes, it is one country, but so different in so many ways!Generally, I like that Lisbon is lively enough and full of locals even in the city center. But a few things that were a little embarrassing to me are the tourists’ and emigrants' way of behaving, and it wasn’t just downtown. I would describe it as unbridled and disrespectful which makes the atmosphere around a little bit cold and not friendly. These are my personal remarks you might not even notice it, but my empathy didn’t allow me to ignore such things.
This city is a really nice place for tourists, but I would think twice about long-term living.

Hello World! — Excited to share with you how my first week in Lisbon with Remote Year went.
The City: Two words: Hills and Festivals. There are hills everywhere. Lisbon is the stairmaster city incarnate — I swear, we are all going to have nice butts at the end of this month. June is also a great month to visit because of all the festivals! All the charming little districts (Alfama, Bica, Bairro Alto, Castelo & Mouraria) bring the party to the streets to celebrate St. Anthony. Grilled sardines, bread with sausage, red wine, music and entertainment fill the streets for the entiremonth.
The Workspace: It’s a 10 minute walk from my apartment and folks shuffle in and out depending on their schedules.
The Gym: Fitness Hut: a 3 minute walk from the workspace and 55 Euros for 5 weeks. The biggest adjustment for me (other than not having my trainer Cheyne to keep an eye on me) is having to ration your water because there are no water fountains! You’d think they’d want to make sure you stay hydrated…
The Routine: Currently non-existent. When I wake up, go to sleep, eat, work out, code, and study vary at different hours of the day every single day. I guess my routine is: Do what you want when you want — I can’t lie, it’s fucking great.
The Work Situation: The UpWork profile is up but I’m having trouble even finding work to submit bids/proposals for. Most of the jobs require the freelancer to be physically located in the U.S and anything remotely related to Finance requires a lot of Strategy and Business Development experience, none of which I really have. I wallowed a bit for a few days: I realized that my resume was top-notch for a Corporate Finance job but unfortunately only that. Smaller and more nimble firms want someone that can not only manage Budget, Pacings, Close from an Operational side but also someone that can do Strategy, Business Dev and even some sales; coding experience would be a huge plus. It’s been a humbling experience for sure…
The Coding: The plan is to go through the free version of CodeAcademy (current progress at 35%) before I commit to the paid version. PluralSight was recommended as well so we’ll see. Luckily, I’ve got a team of software engineers on this program who are all so willing to help throughout this process.
Last but not least, the People: Remote Year Denali is a group of 40 amazing individuals, lead by our fearless leader and positivity unicorn, Erica. (She’s the one wearing the grey jacket on the bottom right of me in the photo below). Everyone is so incredibly talented, driven and passionate about making the most of both their careers and life — it’s impossible to not feel inspired to do the same every single day. Back home, I’ve always felt like the odd one out at work, always questioning things and always pushing the envelope because I wanted more: I wanted more to my career than what people decided for me and I wanted more to life than what I knew. I can’t tell you how incredible it feels to meet 39 other individuals who feel EXACTLY the same way.

Lisbon is an incredible energetic place. And since I moved here, in 2016, the city has developed a lot and, fortunately, it continues to innovate.
One of the best parts of living in the capital is being able to closely follow the growth of the gastronomic scene, which is varied and full of good representative chefs.
It wasn’t an easy task, but I selected my all-time favorite restaurants, from the finest to the tradicional ones — for all tastes and budgets.
Belcanto is one of the main references in the Portuguese gastronomy — with 2 Michelin stars and in 42nd place on “The World’s 50 Best Restaurants” list. If you are looking for an unforgettable experience, this is the place.
Ofício is one of those restaurants that we want to take everyone to visit. They have a menu of sharable dishes and finger food that are absolutely delicious. My favorites: Spider Crab, Sea Vegetable Taco, Old-fashioned Oven Rice and, of course, the best dessert ever, the Cheese Tart by chef Hugo Candeias.
This Viennese coffee house makes me feel at home. They serve traditional Austrian dishes, like Wiener Schnitzel, and my favorite pastries, Apfelstrudel and the Sachertorte. On weekends, they also serve brunch.
Bairro do Avillez is divided into two main areas: Taberna (a more relaxed space, with small dishes, charcuterie and finger food) and Páteo (a sea-food restaurant organized in two floors). My favorite dish is the Flaked Cod with Cornbread and Fried Egg. For dessert, my recommendations are Bairro’s Pavlova and the Olive Oil and Honey Pudding with Lemon Zest.
Tapisco is a mix of Spanish tapas and Portuguese cuisine, with a food menu that is meant to be shared. My recommendations: Tomato Bread with Jamón Ibérico de Bellota, Salted Cod “À Brás” and the Dark Chocolate Mousse with Olive Oil and Fleur de Sel.
The first time I went to Osteria was on my first date with my boyfriend. The place is very cozy, and they serve authentic Italian food, prepared according to old family recipes. I highly recommend the Focaccia and the Pasta al Pesto di Rapa Rossa (picture above).
This is one of those restaurants that is always full of cool people. The highlight, which captures the attention of all who pass by, is the giant Instagram-famous Octopus sculpture dangling above the dining room like a nautical chandelier. The food is Peruvian inspired and the signature dish is ceviche (as the name says).
JncQUOI is located in a historic theater that was converted into a fashionable place, with a high-end men’s store, a DeliBar with gourmet store, and a restaurant. There you will find classic Portuguese and International dishes signed by Chef António Bóia and a wine selection with over 500 references that promise to offer the best wine experience in the country.
Definitely the best sushi in Lisbon. It has the coolest bar area, an elegant dining room, and a beautiful garden for the warmer nights. If you can choose, I would recommend the sushi bar area, where you can see the magic happening. I’ve tried the Tasting Menu, that includes the best selection of creative sushi, sashimi and miso ever. Not to mention the dessert selection, where sugar balance was the rule and things as lime, chocolate, pineapple and flowers were combined in perfect harmony.
Located on the riverside of Lisbon’s Belém district, overlooking the Tejo River, the SUD Terrazza restaurant is influenced by Italian and Mediterranic cuisine. I highly recommend it for a romantic dinner or a family lunch. The view is amazing!
The Oriental Market is located in front of Martim Moniz Square and have lots of different food stalls. If you like Oriental food, this is the place. I recommend the first restaurant, right at the entrance on the left, and also the Mint House, on the second floor, with the best Pad Thai in Lisbon.
It was the smell of fresh pasta (and truffle) that led me to discover this restaurant, which is close to my house and has become one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Lisbon.
The environment is extremely cozy and the pasta is delicious. I’ve returned several times and keep ordering the same dish over and over again: Tagliatelle al ragù di carne. You need to try it!

Before we get into this post, I’ll admit I didn’t travel to Lisbon solo — but it felt like I did. I took this trip with my best friend (at the time), but it may as well have been on my own due to us wanting to do different things on the trip.
I’ll get into all that later, but for now, I’m writing this from the perspective of what I would do (and most things I did) when I travel solo, even if I technically traveled with someone.
In this post, I’ll share my honest review and opinions of Lisbon, Portugal, and what it’s like for a solo female traveler. I’ll also discuss some of the best things I saw, did, and ate while there.
I’ll also be diving deep into the more personal aspects of this trip, including some of the biggest things I’ve learned from my time there and some of the best people I met who have greatly inspired me.
Before I get into the best things I did in Lisbon, I NEED to talk about where I stayed! This hostel was probably the best I’ve ever stayed at — it had everything I could have needed, wanted, and more.
I stayed at Yes! Hostel and could not have chosen a better one. The staff were super friendly, very welcoming, and organized games, nights out, and pub crawls.

If you had ever been to Lisbon, probably you know the Tagus river (Rio Tejo), and Commerce Plaza (Praça do Comércio), but what many people do not know is what we can find in the other margin of the river.
On the south shore of the Tagus river, in Almada city, but precisely in Cacilhas neighborhood, in addition to the traditional restaurants, very interesting tourist activities and the unmistakable architecture, an abandoned pier and ruinous, little-visited nowadays and commonly known as Cais do Ginjal.
I discovered this pier, by pure coincidence, one day after visiting King Christ, I noticed that a few people were exploring on foot an unpaved street that goes down towards the river, I was curious and decided to follow the path to see what was down there.
The descent is a bit steep, slippery and full of holes, the view is very interesting because above we have the King Christ and below the Tagus river and the April’s 25 bridge, there were other foreigners exploring the same path, usually equipped with fancy cameras, comfortable shoes, and lots of sunscreen on the face.
The end of the path is surprising when we come across the Tagus River bank and to the right the…
