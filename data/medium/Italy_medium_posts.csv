La Dolce Vita means “Live the Sweet Life”. Italy is about happiness, pleasure and enjoying the finer things in life. If you see around you in Italy, you will realize that there’s no rush: people are doing things they enjoy and are not running to get a life. They are savouring the life they have.
When you meet someone in Italy, they don’t ask “What do you do for a living”. Instead, they ask “What do you do for living”. Notice the subtle difference.
“What do you do for a living” means what you do to earn a living. “What do you do for living” means what you do for living your life. For living a sweet life. For living La Dolce Vita!
I visited Italy in September (2024) and while I created a somewhat rushed itinerary, I enjoyed every moment of it. In the following sections, I will walk you through those 5 days in which I covered 5 of the best Italian cities (okay 4, Vatican City is a separate country I get it).
Recommendations
If you need to travel much from one city to the other, in order for you to minimise carrying luggage and frequent check-in and check-out, it is recommended that you stay at one place and do day trips from there. In our case, we had 2 such base camps: Rome and Florence and from these 2 cities, we did Naples, Capri, Vatican, and Venice. In such a case it is further recommended that your hotel/Airbnb is near the train station (Roma Termini in our case) so that you can reach there by walking every morning. If this is not possible, atleast ensure that your stay is near a tram station through which you can then reach the train station easily. Typically, what I’ve noticed is that European cities have train stations near the city centre, making it easy for tourists to travel and watch the main attractions. Alright, now onto the trip.
Rome immigration took time, but as soon as we stepped out of the airport, we realized that this trip cannot go wrong. Any trip that includes Italy is a good trip. When you move towards the center of the city, you realise that that’s where the history is. The real Rome is the ancient monuments, like the Colosseum. I wanted to try the top restaurants so I had already booked a few places for the next few days’ lunches. Right after checking into an Airbnb, we headed to Naumachia near the Colosseum. Everything: Bruschetta, Pizza and Pasta were superb.
We then did a long guided tour of Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill. If you’re into history, this is for you. The Colosseum, needless to say is magnificent and is bound to take your breath away.
While on the way back from Collosseum, we chanced upon a lovely street (which we later realised was one of the best streets for shopping in Rome), Via Cavour. It was on this street that I tasted real gelato for the first time.
Make sure you take stuff home from a nearby Carrefour store for the dinner!
Vatican is one of the most well-kept countries/cities in the world. It has beautiful gardens, fountains and buildings.
Ensure that you don’t exit the Vatican gates before visiting the St. Peter’s Basilica. It is extremely beautiful from the outside and even more from the inside.
While exiting the Vatican City, don’t forget to admire these famous stairs!
Coming back from the Vatican City to the City Center/Train Station is probably the best route. Although it is about 5–6 kms long, it includes the Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, Spanish Steps, famous Piazzas (public squares) and some of the best coffee and pizza places in Rome.
I used this map for getting back from Vatican on foot: https://maps.app.goo.gl/NyfvV6j8L7kXuj5H6?g_st=ic
IMO, you do not need a guided tour for Trevi, Spanish Steps and Pantheon.
Don’t forget to keep a coin for tossing it in the Trevi fountain!
On the way back, we found a way to perhaps the best cafe in Rome: Trecaffe! Obviously, I had done a lot of research beforehand for us to “find our way” to this place.
At the risk of repeating myself, as much as possible, you must travel on foot in Rome. You will find a lot of good stuff to admire on the way. For example:
We took a train from Rome to Naples and then a (rough, bumpy) ferry to Capri. This was without doubt (and after some heated debate with my sister) the best place we visited across Switzerland and Italy. An island cannot get better than this — I got to know what ‘living the Capri dream’ truly meant.
With low rocky hills in the backdrop, a rich market crowded by tourists from USA and a ton of beautiful boats to add a touch of affluence, the view was too complex to be imagined. It was enchanting to say the least. There was too much going on in one picture.
The best part of the one-day outing was the Ferry — which takes you around the island and you see the iconic Faraglioni. Stella, di Mezzo and di Fuori: Capri’s legendary trio of sea giants. These are three towering rock formations which jut out from the Mediterranean just off the island’s coast.
Then I absolutely HAD to do the Capri chairlift: a short 20 min journey that offers breathtaking views of the island and the sea.
Capri was a tour but full of colours and sea. Some images cannot be captured on camera — no video can do justice to such places, they have to be experienced. Unless all 5 senses are used, you won’t get to really experience a place like Capri.
We didn’t spend a lot of time in Naples but it seemed to be another interesting city to explore. This is the birthplace of pizza and we would have loved to have one here if we would have had more time. (Part of the reason why we didn’t have enough time was we were finding cake for my sister as it was her birthday)
We shifted base from Rome to Florence on Day 3 and immediately post checking in, set out for the Duomo. We managed to reach there, but only after stopping at a hundred fashion shops.
From wallets to handbags, flee markets to Zaras and superb flatbread sandwiches to the best gelato, Florence has it all. It is worthy of being called the fashion capital (although Milan is the real OG).
The Duomo turned out to be a stunning sight. Its magnificence can be seen in the image below.
Florence is famous for its leather and flee markets are unsurprisingly packed.
The other thing (probably the most important one too) Florence is famous for is the gelato. As a matter of fact, it is the origin of gelato. I did my own research before I came here and here’s what I’ve gathered. Thank me later.
These are the top 3 gelato shops in Florence. But, I’ve not tried any of them as I was more fascinated by the crowd at a store of a native Italian chocolate brand: Venchi.
The gelato was the most scrumptious frozen dessert I’d eaten yet and fine enough to bring me back to Florence some day. Highest quality stuff for sure.
Zara, Sephora and Ferragamo stores were of the size of shopping malls, complete with cafes, lounge areas and rooftop bars.
Overall, Florence had a unique vibe, with fashion and food being highest priorities of people. Here is my attempt to capture the vibe in a video.
There’s a world famous sandwich shop in Florence: All’ Antico Vinaio. While I would recommend everyone to try, I’ve had better ones for sure. Rather, let’s just say it is a different kind of sandwich: one that is not very soft and has some crunch in it.
Imagine a city that is comprised of 120 islands connected by 438 bridges. A city void of roads but full of canals and boats. A city home to some of the finest shops, restaurants and architecture. Venice is that city, except it is also a culture hub and has a rich history. When I reached Venezia Santa Lucia, we just saw a huge canal and big buildings but the real charm of Venice was its streets.
Every alley is a postcard in Venice.
The streets were full of charming shops: the top brands in the world, Venetian glass (Murano/Burano glass), and local leather stuff. Then there were some extremely picturesque shops like these.
The alleys, shops and canals of Venice really took our breath away. The Gondola ride, though short, was pretty good and gave us the truest flavour of Venice.
If you have a few (thousand) Euros and have a tendency to shop, Venice is the place to be. The stores here are alluring and would not disappoint!
Proper planning of your trip is icing on the cake as it ensures that you make the most out of the limited time you have. For my trip, I had planned to the extent that I had booked lunch at some great restaurants as well. This minimized surprises and maximized the time spent on sight seeing.
Any trip that includes Italy is a good trip. It really is a land where appreciation is deeply ingrained in the culture. You learn to appreciate the finer things in life and in turn live a happier one!
The Creator made Italy from designs by Michelangelo. — Mark Twain
I hope this gave you an idea of Italy from a tourist’s lens and will help you plan your own trip. If you enjoyed reading this, you would like the documentation of my experience in Switzerland as well:

We’ve all seen the recent trend of tourists being splashed by water in Barcelona, protests going on worldwide to stop tourism. In this blog, I’m going to share my own personal experience in the locations I’ve visited. I’m not saying it’s like this in all of Italy. I will only share what happened to me, in which location, and why I won’t ever visit again. The mission by the locals was accomplished.
After traveling for 6 months, I regretfully have to say that Italy was the worst country I have ever visited. Again, this is my personal experience. If someone went to the worst part of Slovakia and said Slovakia is the worst country ever, I’d be offended as well because that’s not fair. But if they said they visited specific parts of Slovakia and had a bad experience, I’d have to accept it because that’s a fact. So please do the same with my experience.
What pisses me off the most is that Italy is probably the most Instagrammed country in the world, with better PR than Goebbels had for his propaganda. If you don’t get this reference, please Google who Goebbels was and what he did, as it’s important.
All I see on Instagram when I search for Italy are beautiful beaches, delicious-looking food, and sunny weather. That’s all true, but you never see the other side of anything. It’s one of those “too good to be true” scenarios.
To give you more context, I visited Rome, Calabria, Puglia, and Sardinia. What they all had in common, apart from Puglia, was that everyone tried to rip me off one way or another — looking for opportunities to charge me more or not give me any sort of refund despite being in the right.
I’ve blogged about my 45-day stay in Calabria before. You can read those blogs, as I won’t go into detail here. To summarize, I was just a walking wallet for the locals, who were quite rude to the point where I almost didn’t want to leave my apartment anymore. Not to mention, I was sexually assaulted in broad daylight. But the nature was beautiful, aside from all the rubbish everywhere.
Anyway, let me tell you about my family vacation in Sardinia. We booked an entire apartment for us and three small kids. The owner was a Czech couple who seemed very nice. They had a Facebook group renting out the place to other Czechoslovaks to make some money. The reviews were amazing, they sent pictures, a detailed PDF on where to eat, how to get to different beaches, and so on. The pictures were, of course, amazing. We booked it, and they also recommended a good, well-reviewed car rental service at a reasonable price.
Everything seemed… too good to be true. We landed, and the car rental guy was supposed to wait for us in front of the building. We messaged him, and he replied that he’d be there in a few minutes. After 10 minutes, he messaged saying there was traffic and he’d arrive in an hour. After staying there, I can say that in Sardinia, in October, there’s no such thing as traffic. So that was the first lie.
In 35 minutes, he messaged that he needed to wash the car because it was dirty, so he’d be there in 20 minutes. Just pure nonsense. Anyway, he arrived in an hour, apologized for being late, and told us the car was clean and he wanted it clean when we returned it. He showed us the contract, which took around 15 minutes.
We got in and were leaving the airport. We told him we had 10 minutes free, so we needed to pay when we left. He argued that we only stayed for 5 minutes, so there was no problem. We said there was no way we had only stayed for 5 minutes. By that point, it had been at least 15 minutes. He came with us to the gate and at least paid the fee to let us out. We stopped at the closest shop before driving an hour to our apartment. The car constantly displayed a red alert. We called him, and he told us we were going too slow. Have you ever heard of a car alert that triggers when you’re driving within the city’s speed limit because you’re not going fast enough? Okay.
We got back from the shop, opened the rear door, and the weather strip fell off. It took us 5 minutes to get it back and close the door properly. After that, we decided not to open that door again. We safely arrived at our apartment, thank God.
The apartment was, of course, much smaller than in the pictures, which were taken at angles to make things look bigger. It was clean, apart from the floor, which gave us black socks in 5 minutes. There was supposed to be a couch that converted into a bed. It didn’t — it was just a couch. The mosquito nets were half-broken, so we couldn’t leave the windows open at night unless we wanted to be bitten. No air conditioning either.
The balcony had a great view, but the pictures didn’t show the fence, which blocked off the garden. We thought the kids could run around in the area, but the fence was too close for that to be possible. The balcony had no roof, so privacy was minimal, and we found grape leftovers on the balcony. As we later found out, our neighbors were throwing organic waste into the garden, supposedly to feed the turtles. My question is, why throw it onto your neighbor’s balcony? After seeing a huge rat running across our balcony, we really didn’t understand this habit at all. Our neighbor finished a watermelon and threw it into our garden, right in front of us, as if flipping us off.
Our upstairs neighbor was a crazy German woman who shouted at someone every evening, scaring the kids. The neighbors who threw the watermelon were smoking weed regularly. This was supposed to be a very kid-friendly place, as the Czech owners had told us. Right…
The balcony didn’t close properly, so we froze during windy nights, and mosquitoes got in easily. One day, it rained heavily, and with no roof on the balcony and no drainage system, our apartment got slightly flooded. We messaged the owners, who replied after 4 days, saying it was strange because it “never really rains in Sardinia.” A total lie, but okay. No apology or anything.
We also found a huge bug after lifting the couch cushions. That was truly disgusting. We were really worried about bugs and the kids. This place was a nightmare. You might think, “Oh, that was just false advertising from the Czech owners. So why are you mad at Italy?”
From the second day, every time we got into the car, we smelled fuel. We realized the day before, the car had been sprayed with some sort of perfume, now we knew why — to cover the fuel smell. After two days of driving, the kids started getting headaches and feeling sick, so we contacted the rental company. We then noticed a puddle under the car. The rental company came within 2 hours to give us a new, better car. Honestly, this was incredible service, or maybe they were genuinely scared something would happen to us and the three small kids.
We got a car that was totally an upgrade. We were impressed and happy with the company. We even forgave the guy for being an hour late on day one. That evening, we drove 2.5 km to get ice cream and back, planning a trip for the next day. The next morning, we started the car, and a notification appeared saying we had a flat tire. We checked, and sure enough, there was a nail in it. So, the question was: did the company hand it to us that way? Or were we just that unlucky in 5 km? Or, as we’d heard, was it locals slashing tourists’ tires, which is apparently common in Sardinia? The car had a sticker showing it was a rental, so everyone knew we were tourists.
We went to the beach to calm down. The beaches were nice, and the sea was clean, apart from glass everywhere. Again, not very child-friendly. The rental guy gave us a number for assistance, but we said we’d try to put the spare tire on and drive to a mechanic to avoid higher cost. He said the car did not had a spare tire. It did.
We found the spare tire but it was half-deflated, and the screws were too tight to loosen. Even my big and strong brother-in-law couldn’t budge them.
We contacted the rental guy, and he said, “Call assistance, but you’ll have to pay for it.” To be fair, yes, it was our problem, as we couldn’t prove the nail had been there or that a local had done it on purpose. Facts. We called the assistance number, but it didn’t exist. We checked the insurance papers in the car — it was the same number, still didn’t exist. The guy gave us another number, but it was all in Italian. We waited for an English option, but after 3 minutes, the automation started repeating in Italian. We told the guy there was no English option, and he insisted there was.
We tried again, and after 3 minutes, we got connected. I asked to speak to someone in English. The operator said, “One moment.” After 9 minutes on hold, the call dropped. The guy told us to call a mechanic instead, and while he was helping, if he’d just called the assistance line himself, it would have been sorted in 5 minutes. Instead, he kept messaging us instructions for half a day. This was getting ridiculous. We kindly asked if he could make the call, and he replied,
“Is it a problem for you to make that call? I don’t understand.”
He finally called a mechanic, and of course, it was all sorted super fast. The mechanic didn’t speak a single word of English, by the way.
We got the nail out, and it was strange-looking, sharpened like a razor. This wasn’t a normal nail; it was a setup. And guess what? At another beach, we saw a couple changing their tire in the parking lot. How interesting…
The local shops were more expensive than the poshest shops in London. We went to one restaurant, but otherwise, we cooked, despite the apartment not having an oven or microwave. You could say tourists drive up prices for locals, but if that’s true, it’s greed. So whose fault is that? Also, I’ve never seen supermarkets where two fruits or veggies are wrapped in plastic. We bought some fruit and veggies and generated more plastic waste than we would for a huge shop back home. Where’s the EU now? Why do small countries have to stick to the rules, but big countries can do what they want? We went to another big supermarket — same story.
Putting a nail in the tire of a car that clearly carries kids because it has 7 seats is disgusting. Of course, I don’t have proof…
We were quite happy to leave, in the end. We returned the car to the rental guy. Our flight was at 8 AM, so we needed him at the airport at 6:30 AM. There was a 30-euro fee for returns before 8 AM. Fair enough. But when we messaged him, he replied, “7:15 is better.” Excuse me? I’m paying you 30 euros to get your lazy ass up 45 minutes earlier, and you say 7:15 is better? What is wrong with these people?
Anyway, he agreed to 6:30 in the end and was actually there, thank God. We returned the car completely clean, and he said it wasn’t clean. Okay. Then he said fixing the tire was 250 euros because they had to tow the car to the tire shop (fair enough), but only because the spare tire was half empty (which was his fault). Daylight robbery, in my book.
He gave us a car with constant alerts, a broken door, and leaking fuel. He almost killed us and three kids. And because the spare was half-empty, he had to tow the car, which cost 250 euros. I even started thinking he put the nail in the tire himself to get that money.
My conclusion: Please travel within your own country. Forget visiting other countries. Traveling is good and important, so get your experiences, but then spend your time inside your own country. People will appreciate it, the economy will appreciate it, and you’ll actually have a nice time! That’s what I’m going to do from now on ;)

Other than eat gelato daily of course
I was so lucky to be able travel to Italy for my honeymoon over the Christmas holiday back in 2023. It was truly one of the great experiences of my life and I will cherish those memories for as long as I have access to them.
I grew up in an area that was heavily influenced by Italian-American culture and have Italian roots through my father’s family. We’ve all wanted to go back and reconnect with the heritage. I was not able to back to the ancient roots that my family can trace into southern Italy and Sicily, but getting to see some of the countries’ most famous cities first is the way to go fro me.
We whirled our way through Rome, Florence, and Venice, with some other stops along the way as well. I’m not a travel expert by any means, but I have some tips that I think would be helpful to any first time travelers to Italy.
I am eagerly awaiting the day I feel confident enough to tackle Italy without a translator. Until then though, I’m very happy to travel with a group. The Disney crew we toured with was relaxed, very family centric, and we had two incredible guides.
While our guides took care of translating and guiding my wife and I got to just enjoy the incredible…

The world is a peculiar place. Two million young Italians have left their homeland since 2008, some of them moving to Birmingham. But why? If my armchair experience is anything to go by, they can’t be bored of the food, music, drinks, books or films — and I’d be surprised if they were trying to escape the weather. And yet wherever you go in the world you meet Italians looking for a better life! This is a particularly personal conundrum as my great, great, great, great grandad left Swiss-Italy (Switally™) to move to the UK and so in a way I am too part of the great exodus…
In addition to joy, the Italians even get some of the world’s best history, a mindboggling array of dates and facts… Their empires include the Roman, the Etruscan, the Catholic, the Venetian and Genoese. They even collapse with style, breaking up into 100s of microstates until… in 1861 the House of Savoy (famous for its cabbages and truffles) brought most of the present states together and then almost immediately went back to Empire building — taking bits of Libya, Eritrea, and Somalia and even Austria into the fold. World War I saw Trento and Trieste included, before Mussolini and his dancing fascists took power and were unceremoniously destroyed. Since 1946 its been a democratic republic… and that is where this week’s book begins, or at least where the first of them begins as I read Elena Ferrante’s Neopolitan quartet — four books charting a strong female friendship from the birth of Italian democracy to pretty much the present day. If you haven’t yet read them you probably should, they are beach books with feeling, intelligence, history and anger. They cover politics, sexuality, the complexities of friendship, and the many frustrating flaws of men. Whilst I must admit that by the final book, I had lost love for any of the characters and felt it had all become a bit formulaic I’d none-the-less call the books a publishing triumph…
…but still not as good as the Italian film le quatro volte. Though not a word is spoken, I was rapt from beginning to end. It stars goats, charcoal and a particularly impressive dog, and if that is not enough to whet your appetite, it tackles the concept of reincarnation with perfection. It was one and a half hours of my life so well spent that I’ll never be the same again. I think it is true to say it was the best film I have ever watched. Michelangelo Frammartino is a genius and I can’t wait to watch more…
… and I can’t wait to listen to more Italian music, beautiful relaxing Italian music… I only just touched the sides of what is available, not even daring to start listening to opera or rap but none-the-less I have a 62 song 3.5 hour playlist that I put on whenever I need to relax or take myself away from the day to day. And yes it does include Prisencolinensinainciusol…
…And Ennio Morricone, the soundtrack artist that I listened to whilst attempting to not get hate mail by veganising Sicilian chicken spaghetti. I chose this dish out of the millions of possible Italian regional treats as I had bought my first ever bottle of Frappato, a delicious, light, fruity Sicilian red. We had a wonderful evening but obviously I was unable to create a dish as perfect as when we went out and had actual Italians cook for us… we ate gnocchi, pizza and ravioli, veganised with care and matched with harmonising wines, but nothing prepared us for our final Italian meal… made by one of the Italians who have left the hell that is Italy to come to #BeautifulBirmingham — Pavarotti’s private chef! Though vegan options were lacking, there were great veggie specials on — I remember potato on pizza and lemon on the pasta, I remember a starter of baked bread topped with buffalo mozzarella. I remember wine, and laughter and joy. But I cannot remember the name of a single thing…
…you see it turns out that Italy doesn’t just do incredible savoury food, music, literature, films and wine… it also excels at gelato, tiramisu, coffee and after dinner drinks… These last few weeks have been full of Sambuca, Strega, Montenegro, Amaro and more. Each restaurant seemed to have its own, and it would, of course, have been rude not to try them…
And so I have come to my word count, having not even found time to espouse about the joy of reading Italian poetry and trying to get my head around the difference between the regions. But I must stop, thank Italy and the Italians for their travelling ways and for sharing their bounteous culture with us all, everywhere, all the time. And now I head to Jamaica!

“Two weeks in just Italy?”
That was the reaction from a few friends when I told them our plan. The usual Europe itinerary? Hit a few iconic cities, snap some Insta-worthy shots, and bounce to the next country. But I wanted more - more connection, more moments, more… Italy.
I wanted to slow down. Sip cappuccino (though I’m an occasional coffee person), not just chug it between landmarks. Watch sunsets in sleepy hill towns. Wander into unexpected alleys and let the day unfold.
And now, as I write this mid-journey, I already know this isn’t a one-time trip. This is the beginning of a long-term love story. There’s just so much here - culture, food, landscapes, art, people - that it’s impossible to do it justice in one go.
Next time? I’m heading to the Dolomites, Sardinia, Puglia, Sicily, Cinque Terre… and definitely carving out more time for Lake Como. But this first trip? It gave us the perfect taste of la dolce vita. A beautifully paced, soul-stirring two weeks through:
This trip had it all - breath-taking views, slow mornings, and ridiculously good food, 🍝🍷and so many memorable moments. Every place felt like a living postcard - only better in person. From cappuccino-fuelled mornings ☕ to sunset wine among the vineyards 🍇, Italy gave us everything: art, romance, flavour, and those unforgettable, effortless chill vibes.
And if you’re wondering whether two weeks is enough?
It isn’t.But it’s a damn good start. 🇮🇹✨
Italy is a year-round destination, but when you go makes all the difference in the vibe you’ll experience.
Verdict?If you’re after that perfect balance of good weather and fewer crowds, go for the shoulder season - especially October. 🍷
Here’s what we packed (and thanked ourselves for):
(highlighted are the ones where we stayed)
Milan:
Lake Como (Varenna):
Venice:
Tuscany:
Capri:
Positano:
Rome:
I went with my wife and my MIL - had super fun :)
Here’s a snapshot of our trip.
Full-day-by-day breakdown with travel tips, hidden gems, and favourite eats follows in the full itinerary.
🚆 Travel Tip:
Take the Malpensa Express from the airport - fast, reliable, and gets you to the city center in under an hour.
🚢 Travel Tip:
Varenna is the hidden gem of Lake Como - peaceful, scenic, and perfectly located for ferry trips to Bellagio, Menaggio, and beyond.
🎿 Travel Tips:
Bellagio and Menaggio are also great bases, but Varenna’s compact size and charm make it special.
Check ferry schedules in advance (como-lake-ferry.it), as they vary seasonally.
Visiting Como town from Varenna is challenging due to tight ferry/train connections - prioritize lake villages instead.
🚤 Travel Tip:
Venice is best explored on foot or by vaporetto. Embrace the city’s unique layout and let its charm guide you.
🚌 Travel Tips:
Burano’s vibrant charm is a must-see; allocate ample time to wander its streets.
A Vaporetto day pass (€25) provides unlimited rides and is a cost-effective way to explore.
Picked up our car rental and drove through the Tuscan countryside, its rolling hills, cypress trees, and vineyards painting a picturesque landscape.
🚗 Travel Tip:
Tuscany is best done with a car - slow drives, random detours, and unforgettable views. Ensure your GPS is updated for a smooth journey.
🐶 Travel Tip:
Pre-book winery visits in Montepulciano for a seamless experience, especially during peak seasons.
🍷 Travel Tips:
Pre-book Uffizi & Albola tastings.
Park outside Florence’s ZTL zones (like Villa Costanza).
🚌 Travel Tips:
Book ferry tickets in advance
Capri taxis = convertible joyrides. They’re pricey but totally worth it.
🌅 Travel Tip:
Book sunset boat rides early and bring a sweater - it gets breezy.
🚌 Travel Tip:
Buses are scenic but unreliable - private transfer is smoother if your schedule is tight. I took the bus ticket from the nearest grocery store.
🚉 Travel Tip:
Rome is best explored on foot - pack comfy shoes and let the streets lead you.
🚌 Travel Tip:
Book Vatican tickets in advance via the official site to skip long lines and save cost. Don’t arrive too early for Vatican tickets - 15 mins before your time slot is perfect.
✈️ Travel Tip:
Flying out the next morning? Book a transfer to the airport the night before and enjoy your final Roman night stress-free. We took a train back to the airport and it was seamless.
Transport:
Driving:
Tickets:
Dining:
Budget Tip:
Italy stole our hearts - and our tastebuds. This 2-week journey gave us iconic sights, jaw-dropping scenery, unforgettable flavours, and all the dolce vita vibes we dreamed of.
From vineyard sunsets to gelato by the streets, this wasn’t just a trip - it was a love affair with life itself. The kind you replay in your head long after you’re home.
Next adventure? Already in the works. Stay tuned.
Ciao for now, amici! 🇮🇹💫

When I visited Italy, I had some set expectations. It was probably because I had read so much about Italy. My Italian colleagues had also contributed to my judgments and expectations, like food or cleanliness (or the lack of it).
Almost all the Italians I know, have a very high standard when it comes to food. Some of my Italian colleagues are very finicky about the lunch in our office, but that’s because the lunch is made as per the Dutch standard (I work in Amsterdam), and according to the Italians and even the Dutch, you just can’t compare Italian cuisine with Dutch (or for that matter any other cuisine).
This had, of course, raised my bar, because I come from India and the spices and the variety of food that you get in India, even for everyday regular meals, is to a different standard.
However, I was disappointed with the food in Italy.
On the other hand, I was remarkably surprised by some other aspects, like the presence of art in their daily lives, the frequency of Lamborghinis on the street, or the uber-expensive designer wear.

Italy has always been my dream destination as I grew up watching Bollywood movies where many Italian places like the Colosseum, Venice, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are shown. During my work assignment in Switzerland, I had the incredible opportunity to explore this beautiful country in just three days. Starting from Zurich, my journey took me to Milan, Venice, Pisa, and Rome. Even though my schedule was tight, this trip was unforgettable where I was lucky to see stunning places and have delightful moments.
Let me take you through my whirlwind Italian 3-day trip.

When I think about Italy, I think about a place I never ever want to leave. It reminds me of places in Disney I dreamed of as a young girl, hoping my dashing prince in a dazzling amour would steal me away to, and we would ride into beautiful lands, under the soothing breeze in the evening sun. I asked a friend how he would describe how Italy makes him feel, and he said “Romance. A date night in Venice driving an expensive car wearing a white shirt and having on good perfume and her wearing a sundress and red lipstick”.
We all have our various descriptions of how Italy makes us feel. One thing we would all agree on is that Italy is a place where our dreams come alive!
When I think of Italy I think of peace, beauty, and history. It’s not just a country, it’s an experience, a lifestyle, it’s an unending sweet memory for everyone who gets a taste of “la dolce vita”.
REASONS WHY ITALY HAS OUR HEARTS
La Dolce Vita
This translates to English “The sweet life”. This embodies a lifestyle that is the core of Italy’s identity. It’s more than just a saying, it’s a philosophy, an attitude, and an outlook on life that makes even the mundane aspects of life fulfilling. It is a lifestyle that enjoys the sweetness of life, its pleasures, slow leisures, relaxations, and the finest things it offers. After the popular film of the 1960s la Dolce Vita by the outstanding director Federico Fellini, this phrase became a popular phrase attached to the country. In its broadest sense, “la dolce vita” is about savoring life — enjoying good food, company, and the beauty of the world around us. It’s about finding joy in the small, everyday moments, whether it’s a leisurely meal with friends, a walk through a sunlit city street, or enjoying a glass of wine at sunset. The phrase encapsulates a spirit of hedonism, but it’s not necessarily about excess; rather, it’s about balance — taking the time to appreciate life’s sensory pleasures. The ease of this lifestyle is why every single person desires to attach themselves to the luxury of this idea.
Art
Italy is considered one of the birthplaces of western art, giving expression to one of the most celebrated artists in human history, the most fascinating architectural wonders throughout the world hailing from its origin. From the ruins of ancient Rome to the modern art galleries of Milan, Italy’s rich artistic heritage, its art continues to evolve, influencing and shaping global art for centuries. Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome became the cultural epicenters of Europe, drawing innumerable people to the awe of its rich beauty. So many people come to Italy and all they can take away from these cities is the depth of thoughtfulness, talent, creativity, and genius that produces such great art. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci with Monalisa, and Michelangelo Buonarroti, known for his sculpture David and his work on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which remains one of the most revered artistic achievements in history. From the roadside views to the elaborate museum, Italy is the home of art. We will forever love it!
Food
If there’s anything Italy is associated with it’s the many delicacies it offers. It is a country where cuisine is not merely about nutritional sustenance but a reflection of the country’s history, culture, and regional diversity. Italian food is celebrated globally for its simplicity, flavor, and use of high-quality, fresh ingredients. Food in Italy is more than a meal; it’s an integral part of the Italian way of life, a social experience, and a manifestation of family, tradition, and place. From the rich pasta dishes of the south to the taste-fulfilling risottos of the north, and creamy pizza from Naples, you’ll find rich, hearty dishes like lasagna, tortellini, and bolognese sauce a delight. From Rome to southern Italy, to Milan and all its beautiful cities, each of them comes with its specialties, curated with expertise and care. Food in Italy is an expression of love, pride, and tradition. Italian families often pass down recipes from generation to generation, and meals are a time for bringing people together. Whether in a bustling trattoria, a family kitchen, or a high-end restaurant, food is central to Italian life, fostering community and connection. Many Italian celebrations — such as Christmas, Easter, and regional festivals — are marked by elaborate feasts that showcase the country’s diverse culinary heritage. This is why we love Italy
Natural and Man-made Awes
Italy isn’t just known for its art, food, and lifestyle, it’s blessed with the most gorgeous nature, with stunning landscapes the snow-capped peaks of the Alps in the north to the golden beaches of the Mediterranean coast, and the historic architecture that graces its cities and towns, Italy’s natural beauty and man-made structures continue to top the world’s most popular tourist attractions. Italy’s varied topography is dominated by mountain ranges, with some of the most dramatic peaks in Europe. These mountains offer breathtaking views and a wide range of outdoor activities, like skiing, hiking, and mountaineering.Italy’s coastline stretches for more than 7,000 kilometers, offering some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe.
The glistening shores of the Amalfi Coast and the pristine sands of Sardinia are its main locations. The country’s beaches cater to every taste — whether you’re seeking luxury resorts, charming coastal villages, or quiet, hidden coves.
Last but not least, the Italian architecture is renowned for its rich history, artistic expression, and innovative design, influencing architectural styles around the world for centuries. From ancient Roman engineering feats to modern design movements, Italy has been a cradle for groundbreaking ideas in architecture. The foundation of Italian architecture can be traced to ancient Rome, where monumental structures like the Colosseum, Pantheon, and Roman Forum showcased the mastery of arches, vaults, and concrete construction. Romans perfected the use of concrete, allowing them to build large-scale structures with unprecedented durability and grandeur. We know so well that Italy’s beauty will continue to transcend time and generations just as it always has.
Love & Romance
Italy is often synonymous with love and romance, a country where passion is its culture and history. With romantic cities to its art, literature, and food, Italy has long been a symbol of romance, drawing couples from around the world to experience the magic of its cities and countryside. Many of Italy’s cities have a natural allure for lovers. Venice, with its winding canals and romantic gondola rides, is perhaps the most famous destination for romance. The city’s dreamy atmosphere, with its ancient palaces, narrow alleys, and bridges like the Rialto and the Bridge of Sighs, evokes a sense of timeless love. The Gondola ride along the canals remains one of the most iconic romantic experiences.
The floating city Florence, birthplace of the Renaissance, is another city that captured the hearts of lovers. Its art, architecture, and breathtaking views like Piazzale Michelangelo or the top of the Duomo are perfect settings for romance. Florence also hosts the Vasari Corridor, a hidden passage that once connected the offices of the ruling Medici family with their private palace, offering an air of mystery and history for lovers to explore. With movies, music, and tales that show us Italy’s beautiful love and romance in our everyday world, like my friend when saying he thinks of Italy, he thinks Romance, it’s the same for millions around the globe, It’s a universal feeling.
Culture
Italian culture is one of the richest, most diverse, and influential in the world. Its long history, shaped by ancient civilizations, the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, and centuries of regional traditions, has given Italy a unique cultural identity that continues to resonate globally. Italian culture blends art, music, cuisine, fashion, architecture, and family life into a living celebration of beauty, passion, and creativity. Italy is renowned as the origin of some of the world’s most important art movements, including the Renaissance, which emerged in the 14th century and reached its peak in the 16th century. The works of artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian still stand as monumental achievements in the history of Western art. Italy is home to countless masterpieces housed in museums, churches, and palaces. With its people who are warm and receptive to strangers on travel explores, to the rich language, and festivals of its several descents, Italy’s depth and cultural diversity cannot be ignored.
There are so many reasons to love Italy and these are a few. When we think about Italy our hearts burst with excitement and longing for the experiences it gives us! Italy is such a great country and its greatness is still waiting to be discovered!
What are your favorite things about it?

Italy is not just a destination — it’s a journey through centuries of art, passion, and flavor, where every corner tells a story and every meal is a celebration.
I have been in Germany for almost a year as a medical Ph.D. student. This is the first time for me to travel in Europe except for Germany and to my pleasure, Italy is the first country I visit here. So it’s a good time to tell you about my recent life here.
Our routines are as follows:
City №1: Milan
City №2: Venice
City №3: Florence
City №4: Pisa
City №5: Rome
Place №6: Vantican
Milan Catheral (Duomo di Milano)
I stood in front of the Milan Cathedral, completely captivated — its delicate spires stretched into the sky like frozen music, and as I wandered through its vast, echoing interior, I could almost feel the weight of history in every carved stone and shaft of light. And its rooftop offers panoramic views of Milan and the Alps on clear days.
Unfortunately, we didn’t have an opportunity to reach the roof of it but we reserved St. Peter’s Basilica roof ticket which we look more forward to it.
Milan Central Station (Stazione Centrale)
Walking into Milan Central Station felt like stepping into a grand palace disguised as a train hub — its towering arches, ornate stonework, and sheer scale make it one of the most majestic railway stations I’ve ever seen, blending Fascist-era power with Art Deco elegance.
City №2: Venice
We only spent half a day in Milan and then took the fast train from Milan to Venice. You can see a lot of luxury shops there, but we are not rich enough, so why not leave earlier, right?
Right outside the train station, Ponte degli Scalzi was my first real step into Venice — it gave me that instant “I’m really here” moment, with boats gliding under its stone arch and the Grand Canal unfolding before me.
Barefoot bridge(Ponte degli scalzi)
Rialto bridge
The Rialto Bridge is pure drama — crowded, grand, and full of life. Standing at its peak, I watched gondolas, vaporettos, and reflections dance along the Grand Canal, Venice’s main artery pulsing with history.
St. Mark’s Square
St. Mark’s Square felt like the heart of an empire — wide, majestic, and echoing with footsteps and pigeons. Surrounded by grand architecture, I stood in awe beneath the domes of the Basilica and the watchful eye of the Campanile.
Ponte dell’ accademia (academy bridge)
Ponte dell’Accademia gave me my favorite panoramic view of the Grand Canal. The soft curve of the water, historic facades, and distant dome of Santa Maria della Salute — it all looked like a living painting.
Murano island (without picture)
In Murano, the furnaces burn hot and the glass glows. The island buzzes with centuries-old craft, and watching the artisans shape molten glass felt like peeking into a world of tradition and skill. I find it a bit crowded and boring.
Burano
Burano stole my heart. It was peaceful, almost dreamlike — with fewer tourists, quiet alleys, and rows of cheerful, colorful houses reflected in calm canals. It felt like a hidden storybook village where time slows down.
City №3: Florence
Florence is a city that feels both intimate and immense — it’s small enough to walk across, yet bursting with history at every turn. With its narrow streets, lively piazzas, and Renaissance beauty, it thrives quietly, blending daily life with timeless art. Everything is close: cathedrals, cafes, museums, and the river Arno. It’s a place where convenience meets cultural depth.
Uffizi Gallery
The Uffizi Gallery is a treasure trove of Renaissance masterpieces. Walking through its elegant corridors, I stood face to face with Botticelli’sBirth of Venus — graceful, ethereal, and iconic — and just steps away,Primavera (Spring), bursting with life and symbolism. Giotto di Bondone’s Madonna Enthroned stood solemn and powerful, a bridge between medieval devotion and the early stirrings of the Renaissance. Every room held a window into centuries of beauty, belief, and brilliance.
Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael Sanzio are three of the most famous and influential artists of the Italian Renaissance. They’re often considered the ultimate “trio” of Renaissance genius.
Giotto di Bondone’s Madonna Enthroned
Spring
Botticelli’s Birth of Venus
Gentleman -Raphael
Santa maria novella square (piazza santa maria novella)
Old bridge (ponte vecchio)
Michelangelo square
Santa croce square (piazza santa croce)
Pisa
Pisa is more than just its famous leaning tower — it’s a charming, walkable city with a laid-back vibe and deep historical roots. The heart of the city, Piazza dei Miracoli, feels almost surreal, with the Leaning Tower tilting beside the grand cathedral and baptistery, all glowing white against the green grass.
If you come here, don’t forget to take the iconic pictures with the Leaning Tower.
City №5: Rome
Rome (Capital) is a vast, booming city where ancient ruins and modern life collide in an exhilarating rhythm. It’s busy, loud, and alive — cars zip past thousand-year-old monuments, and every corner holds a piece of history. At the Colosseum, I stood where gladiators once battled, imagining the roar of the crowd echoing through time. The Borghese Gallery offered a quieter side of Rome — intimate rooms filled with masterpieces by Bernini, Caravaggio, and Canova. And at the Trevi Fountain, surrounded by crowds and coins tossed in mid-air, I joined the tradition, making a wish in front of its dramatic baroque sculptures.
Colosseum
Borghese Gallery
Trevi Fountain
Place №6 Vatican
Italy was breathtaking and full of unforgettable sights — from Venice’s canals to Rome’s ancient ruins — but there was never enough time to see it all. It was beautiful, intense, and exhausting in the best way.

After almost three years of living semi full-time in Italy, I can confidently say this place has changed us in ways we never anticipated. But to be fair, we didn’t think much about the life lessons this move would bring.
We’re adaptable people-anyone who’s lived abroad has to be-but every time we return to the U.S. or our other “home” in the Czech Republic, we feel a jolt of culture shock.
This place ruined the old me-the version of myself who didn’t know how to live at a slower pace or appreciate a good bottle of olive oil for under $20. Living in Italy has reshaped our habits and redefined how we experience the everyday. These things have become essential to our lives, and honestly, I don’t see us giving them up anytime soon.
Groceries are a basic need, right? You buy food, you eat. Simple. But what absolutely boggles my mind is how, in some places, this necessity is so expensive that it feels more like a luxury.
In Italy, staples like olive oil, cheese, eggs, butter, and fresh produce are not only affordable but consistently high in quality. I don’t need to hunt down an overpriced boutique grocery store (eff you, Whole Foods) just to find something decent-it’s always available, whether I’m at the discount supermarket or the farmers’ market in town.
Of course, specialty items like peanut butter (because let’s face it, that’s not exactly an Italian staple) come with a higher price tag, but I’m okay with that. What I’m not okay with is paying $6 for a loaf of bread in the U.S. If you can justify that, we probably wouldn’t see eye to eye on much else, either.
This affordability doesn’t just make life easier-it frees up our budget for other things we value. In places where groceries would devour half our paycheck, living in Italy has been a much-needed breath of fresh air.
When I think about raising my four-year-old daughter here, the word safe is the first thing that comes to mind. I’d feel completely at ease sending her down the street to the local shop to buy apples and walk back home on her own. That’s the level of trust I have in our community.
It’s an old-world kind of safety, the kind that existed before everyone started worrying about every possible bad thing that could happen. Here, my daughter plays outside without constant supervision. Sometimes, she even wanders into a neighbor’s house (without me even knowing), spends time watching them cook or knit, and inevitably leaves with a sweet treat.
This kind of freedom and peace of mind is something I could never put a price on. A sense of tight-knit community is one of the most romanticized aspects of living in Italy, and for good reason-because it’s true.
We live near the cusp of what you’d call southern Italy, and let me tell you-southern Italy has its own unique rhythm. You either thrive in it, or it’ll drive you crazy.
Here, rules are more like suggestions, and there’s an unspoken agreement that not everything needs to be taken too seriously. It’s not anything goes, but there’s a collective sense of, “Let’s not sweat the small stuff.”
People splash Sambuca liqueur into their morning coffee at the bars without a second thought before heading to work, and they casually drive home from hunting trips with wild boars strapped to the hoods of their cars. It’s wild, untamed, and utterly charming-depending on how you see the world. This relaxed attitude is a stark contrast to environments where everything feels rigidly structured.
It’s an atmosphere that gives us the freedom to color outside the lines, live a little more creatively, and just breathe.
We lived in NYC before moving to Italy, so we already had a taste of what it’s like to rely on walking. But here, it’s taken to another level, mostly out of necessity and pre-modern infrastructure.
In many small towns and villages, the streets are so narrow that driving is either impractical or downright impossible. It’s just easier (and makes you look less silly) to walk.
What I love most about this is how it turns walking into an everyday habit, not just something you do for exercise or leisure. Walking more will change your life, people! Even when we’re traveling elsewhere, I’m the one constantly suggesting, “Should we just walk?” Italy has made walking an essential-and joyful-part of life.
We also recently spoke with an American man who spent three consecutive months in Italy and, during that time, lost 20 kg (44 lbs) just from walking more. He didn’t do any other type of exercise. Now those are numbers!
I’ve always identified as a Type A personality. I’m organized, efficient, and thrive on getting things done. So, when we first moved here, Italy’s slower pace felt like a direct challenge to my way of being.
But over time, I realized it was a gift. The lack of urgency that defines life here has forced me to slow down and reevaluate what’s truly important. Reality check: most of it isn’t a life-or-death situation, no matter how much I make it out to be. Sure, I still get things done, but now I do it in a calmer, less stressful environment.
It’s a lesson I didn’t know I needed, and I’ll take this slower, more intentional way of living over a high-pressure, fast-paced one any day.
If you love history, art, or anything with a story to tell, Italy is like living in a time capsule-in the best way possible. Every street, piazza, and weathered wall feels like it has a tale to share, and I can’t ever get enough of it.
Walking through ancient town centers or exploring centuries-old villas doesn’t just make me happy-it reminds me why I love being here. There’s no sterile, cookie-cutter vibe. It’s history, charm, and soul, all bundled into daily life.
There’s a depth to living here that I can’t find in places that feel like they were built last week. It’s not just about aesthetics; it’s about the soul of the place. Italy is just f*cking charming, plain and simple. Who wouldn’t want to be surrounded by that?
—
Living in Italy has certainly reshaped what we value in our daily lives, from the simplest routines to the bigger picture. It’s not just the habits we’ve picked up; it’s the mindset shift that’s changed what we prioritize.
Have you ever lived somewhere that altered your perspective in ways you didn’t expect? I’d love to hear your stories.

First of all, it is good to remember that Italy is divided into twenty regions, and each region is different from the others, so life changes depending on which part of Italy you are in.
Living here (Livigno)
it’s different to live here (Milan)
Or here (Sardinia)
Or here (Umbria)
Or in my city (sorry, I have a soft spot for my city):
Ok, having said that, what is it like to live in Italy in general?
Disadvantages of living in Italy? Bureaucracy, taxes, and sometimes inefficiency of the public apparatus. (but not excessive).

Traveling through Italy and immersing in its culture and lifestyle have always been on my bucket list. I was supposed to go in March 2020, but as fate would have it, the whole world came to a grinding halt, no thanks to Covid-19. Italy became the epicenter of the pandemic in Europe and immediately went into lockdown.
In a blink of an eye, my long-awaited trip burst into flames. I remember wallowing in self-pity, lying on my bed for days, trying to reconcile in my head just how a viral disease could bulldoze my meticulously-planned vacay. (Yes, this sounds selfish against the backdrop of millions of people getting infected and dying at an alarming rate, but hey, I can’t help how I felt!)
The silver lining was that I was able to claim my money back for the airfares, accommodations, and museum/gallery entrance tickets. All except ItaliaRail due to its no-refund policy for the e-tickets I bought.
Fast forward to May 2022. I dared to revisit my Italian trip. Determined to experience Italy to the fullest, I decided to go during the low season — mid-December. I planned to cover 4–5 cities, so I allocated 14 days for this trip, including the 2 days spent in the skies.
Being a borderline obsessive-compulsive planner, I identified the cities, the tourist spots, and the ‘off the beaten’ tracks to explore as early as May. Then, I started booking my flight tickets, accommodations, and entrance tickets for museums and churches.
I waited until November to book train tickets when I was confident enough that Italy and/or Malaysia were not going into any kind of lockdown again. This time, I held back my excitement. Well, if the trip was canceled again, I didn’t want to go through another episode of bottomless depression.
And oh, my husband was my travel companion. I toyed with the idea to go it alone but he was worried about my safety, so he came with me anyways, letting me dictate the whole travel plans. You see, our ideas of dream vacations have often collided, and this one proved to be no different, as you’ll find out later in my story. As he succinctly put it, his role was my bodyguard and navigator. In retrospect, I was grateful he came along because I’m bad at reading maps and have no sense of direction.
The cities on my list:
✔ Milan (Lombardy region)
✔ Bologna (Emilia-Romagna region)
✔ Cinque Terre (Liguria region)
✔ Florence (Tuscany region)
✔ Rome (Lazio region)
Initially, Milan wasn’t on my wishlist because it’s relatively more metropolitan than the other cities. The things that most appeal to me are historical architecture, quaint towns, rustic countryside, and coastal scenery. So, Rome, Florence (and its surrounding Tuscan towns), and Cinque Terre fit the bill.
But most airlines from Kuala Lumpur (KL) only fly to either Milan or Rome. Cinque Terre is closer to Milan. I suppose it made sense to arrive in Milan, visit the above-named cities while gradually proceeding south, and finally depart from Rome after completing the journey.
As I wasn’t keen on spending one whole day exploring Milan, I decided to book a full-day tour of Lake Como, which is a 2-hour drive away from the city center. Who knows, I might bump into George Clooney!
I was checking out other nearby cities from Milan and happened upon Bologna. I found out they have not one but two leaning towers — Asinelli and Garisenda. Did you know that Asinelli is taller than the famous Pisa? Asinelli slants at 97.02 m; Pisa pales in comparison with 57 m! And just like that, Bologna was added to my itinerary.
I’m a firm believer in planning my trips, especially to places I’ve never been before to avoid unexpected disappointment. I once heard of a friend who went to Rome and thought of just winging it. They arrived on Saturday but only decided to go to the Vatican Museums on Sunday. They were greeted by museum doors wide shut! Had they checked the opening days in advance, they could’ve gone on Saturday instead and experienced the grandeur of the exhibits.
Yet, my meticulous planning can still be derailed by other external circumstances. You’ll find out in subsequent entries.
As we’ll be staying 2–3 days in each city and moving around by train from one city to the next, my husband said it’d be wise to use backpacks. I was apprehensive because now I had to pack fewer clothes and necessities.
As a result, I had to spend every evening washing and drying clothes. During our stay in Florence, I made my husband go to a coin-op laundry because our Airbnb accommodation has no space to hang and dry our clothes.
In hindsight, we should’ve brought suitcases. The cities we went to (except for Cinque Terre) are pretty flat and walkable. In 2 of the cities, we had to walk some 30 minutes from the train station to our Airbnb, so lugging my backpack the whole way caused me back pain and made me more short-tempered with my travel companion (since it was his idea to use backpacks).
December is wintertime in Italy. So, we packed winter jackets and thermal wear. But how do I fit these bulky items into my backpack? Thank God for vacuum-sealed bags! By putting the bulkier stuff into the bags and sucking out the air inside them, I had more space in my backpack to fill other things. Apart from clothing items, we brought:
✔ Toiletries (in small bottles)
✔ Medicines (flu tablets, cough lozenges, painkillers)
✔ Instant noodles, pre-cooked packed rice, and condiments (for nights when we’re too tired from all the sightseeing during the day)
As linens also take up space, I made sure all our Airbnbs provide them so we don’t have to bring our own.
The Italians are a proud nation. Although most of them can speak English, their default is their mother tongue.
Armed with this knowledge, I learned some basic Italian to get by with polite greetings and menu ordering. This proved to go a long way because most Italians I met were more appreciative and helpful if I greeted them in Italian before switching to English (usually to ask for directions).
Once I’ve identified the cities, it gets easier to map out my travel plans. I had a list of must-see places in my head (e.g., the Colosseum, Pantheon, Vatican Museums, Uffizi Gallery, Michelangelo’s David). From these places, I’d expand to find nearby historical/notable spots, preferably within walking distance.
For example, in Rome, Pantheon is on my hit list, but the famous fountains (di Trevi and dei Quattro Fiumi) are also near the vicinity. So, it made sense to do it all on the same day!
Knowing which places you want to visit in advance also helps in allocating how many days you want to stay in a city so you can book accommodations and train tickets accordingly. There are many historical places, galleries, and plazas I want to see in Florence. On top of that, I want to go see the Tuscan countryside too. So, 4 days in Florence.
For museums, galleries, palaces, and churches, be sure to note down these details:
✔ Opening hours and days
✔ Entrance fees
✔ Possibility for online booking (to skip long queues)
The opening hours and days will help you determine which day and time you should go to these attractions.
Also, I can’t stress enough the advantages of online booking. Most times, I had to hide the smirk on my face when walking up to a museum entrance with my online booking documents and simply sailed past the long line of people.
We arrived in Milan bright and early. Knowing that our apartment wasn’t ready yet, I had planned to go to the Milan Cathedral and Sforza Castle first. So, we took the Malpensa Express train from the airport to Milan Central station. Luggage storage facilities are available in major train stations like this one, so don’t worry about dragging your heavy bags around.
The Milan Cathedral, or Duomo di Milano in Italian is a magnificent sight to behold. It was tiring being on a long-haul flight, so we opted not to climb up to the rooftop that’s famous for its gargoyles, spires, and statues.
Pacing myself outside the cathedral and examining the Gothic architecture built from intricately-carved marble, I was awestruck. Gargoyles and statues in every imaginable shape and form lining up the exterior also add to the enigma. I’m sure each of them has its own unique story.
The term ‘Duomo’ refers to a church, built as, or having the features of, a cathedral, for that particular city. So, if you’re in Siena and saw the Siena Cathedral, you’ll know that it’s also called Duomo di Siena.
As with any other popular tourist spot, watch out for unsolicited sellers. As the courtyard attracts flocks of pigeons, most peddlers would offer you maize in plastic bags. Their M.O. is to come up to you to offer to take pictures or directly hand you the packed maize while you’re engrossed in taking pics or vids on your own. In short, the highest probability of it happening is when you let your guard down.
I grossly underestimated how cold it was and had only one winter coat in my carry-on to wear. The temperature was between 1–3°C with light showers in between. I might have suffered from imaginary frostbite!
As it was nearing Christmas, there were cute and colorful stalls set up in front of the Duomo. I bought a wool scarf at one of the stalls to try to keep warm.
Not able to withstand the cold any longer, we walked into Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, another well-known Milan landmark that also happens to be a high-end shopping gallery. It’s right next to the cathedral. The price tags didn’t stop us from doing a bit of window shopping.
Cold and hunger proved to be a bad combination, so we hunted for food. There’s a place nearby called Panzerotti Luini, based on our research. It sells fried panzerotti, a savory turnover much like calzones. We had the ones with tomato and mozzarella filling, and man, it was so good! Or was it because we were famished? I really couldn’t tell.
Then, off we went to Sforza Castle by train from the Duomo station. The journey took only 10 minutes. Castello Sforzesco is a medieval fortress built in the 14th century but was restored and renovated by Francesco Sforza, the Duke of Milan in the 15th Century. It had since undergone renovation and expansion throughout the centuries and even survived WWII bombings. Now an art gallery, you can buy tickets to view the art collection in it.
We roamed around the castle grounds while listening to a busker playing ‘Hey Jude’ with his guitar. The whole scene played out like an Instagram reel!
In the afternoon, we checked in to our Airbnb. Our gracious host, though trying her best to be accommodating, can only speak Italian, bless her soul. The only English she spoke was ‘thank you’. Thank God for Airbnb messaging with its auto translator function. She used it to give instructions on using appliances in her apartment. My first question was of course, how to turn on the heating system.
Our body clocks seemed to think that it was past midnight (following Malaysian time) so after settling down, we took a long nap.
We had to drag ourselves out of bed around 5 pm. We were supposed to go to Navigli canals. Knowing that it’d get colder, we decided to take an Uber to go there instead of taking the train.
Only Uber Premium was available, charging up to 40 EUR during this peak time. Gritting my teeth, we hopped into the Volvo S60.
It was 6 pm, the city was jammed up, and our driver was in the foulest mood. He almost ran over a cyclist. In retaliation, the cyclist banged the roof of the Volvo sedan. Our driver got out and there was a screaming match.
He went after the cyclist as he pedaled away, but maybe remembering he had passengers, thought better of it, and went back inside the car. He casually turned around to us and said, “Always happens”. I giggled awkwardly, suppressing my heart attack.
The rest of the journey was uneventful with the driver speeding through intersections, seemingly oblivious to cars that might come from the left or right junctions. Finally, we arrived after almost 60 minutes, when it was supposed to be a 25-minute ride in normal hours.
Like Venice, Milan used to be linked with canals. In fact, the canals were built to ferry workers and raw materials back and forth to expedite the construction of famous Milano landmarks — the Duomo being one of them. As motorized land vehicles began to dominate the transportation system, most of the canals were cemented over, but the Navigli survives. Today, it becomes a trendy, canal-based neighborhood.
Although we arrived when it was already dark, the Navigli seemed to have only woken up! There are plenty of cafes and bars alongside the canals, made even more charming with Christmas lights. We strolled along the canals, observing the locals making their way to these places for dinner and drinks. (Italians usually have their dinner pretty late, around 8–9 PM).
No annoying peddlers were trying to sell us trinkets, so we savored the laid-back, nighttime ambiance.
Aware that we’d have to start our day early for a full-day Lake Como tour tomorrow, we decided to leave at 9.30 PM just when the music from the bars was about to go full-blast.
We learned our lesson and took the train instead to head back to our rented apartment. It was a cheaper, more boring ride back.
Stay tuned for my next entry on our Lake Como trip. Spoiler alert: No sightings of George Clooney or any Hollywood celebrity, whatsoever!

Think you know Italy? Think again.
Though I knew a fair amount about Italian culture before moving to Calabria last year, I’ve learned a few things that have surprised me now that I’m here.
In the U.S., we are used to being spoiled by friends and family for our birthdays, aren’t we?
Here, it’s the opposite. You, the birthday girl, are supposed to take out your loved ones to celebrate you. I think it’s to offset the cost of the gifts that they give you.
This year, I avoided breaking the bank by having a party at my house instead. But I almost made a faux pas by offering to split a meal the day after my birthday with my “Italian mamma” until I remembered this strange cultural norm and quickly went to pay for our lunch.
I have never been big on blowdrying my hair, but in Italy, I get raised eyebrows.
It turns out, Italians believe in what they call a colpo d’aria, literally a hit of air. It causes, or so they believe, headaches, colds, and a litany of maladies. And having wet hair invites it.

If you are a new student in Italy from another country, this story is for you! I’ve been living in Turin for about 5 years and want to share my experiences with you. If it helps even one person, I’ll be happy. 🥰
First, I give a brief introduction about myself. When I was in my own country (Iran, Tehran), I studied software engineering and working as a front-end web developer for 3 years. After a 5-year gaps, I returned to academia. 🤓📚
I moved to Italy, Turin in August 2019 and graduated in December 2022. I studied in Politecnico di Torino to get a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering with a Data Analytic specialty. I began working for one year as a business data Analyst; you can read more about my job experience here.
Before moving forward, I need to point out that these are just my personal observations and views; other people may have different experiences.
Okay, let’s have a look at the challenging parts of studying and living in Italy. 🤟🏼
Without a doubt, the most difficult aspect for me was Italian language! Yes years of studying English from bottom of my heart was nothing! 🥲 (Believe me I get used to study English as a hobby) and the fact is nearly 97% of the Italian population speaks Italian and only 13% of Italians speak English. English is a mandatory school subject in Italy, however it’s not taught very well.
The main reason my Italian hasn’t improved much, because my master’s degree was in English and I was surrounded by international students and academics, and when I started working, I noticed it was essential to know Italian language, and most of the recruiters will ask you about the level of your language and personally I lost some job opportunities just because I can’t speak Italian well. 🥲
Even if you work in a large company with foreign colleagues, don’t expect them to switch to English during the internal meetings, in coffee or lunch time; trust me, it’s hard for them and need to put more efforts. People in shops, post offices, and nearly everywhere speak Italian. 🤷🏻‍♀️
So, even if you don’t want to stay in Italy for ever, I recommend that you start learning Italian as soon as you decide to come here. 🤝 🇮🇹 Knowing the language will greatly improve your quality of life, as well as your ability to make friends and integrate. When you first try to speak Italian, Italians are quite helpful if they feel that you are making efforts. So, don’t be shy; start talking, even if you only know a few words, use them. 💪🏼
For the first year as a student on a tight budget, it was difficult for me to rent my own flat (In Italian: monolocale), So I lived in a shared house with other flatmates and roommates, but for the second and third years I had my own room in the university dormitories.
If you would like to live in a shared house, you should be prepared for the challenges that come with coexisting and living with other people. However, it might be helpful at first to not feel alone and making friendships and meet people who have a similar situation as you.
To find a house, try to check the Facebook or Telegram groups. Prices vary depending on location, proximity to universities, and city centre. Furthermore, it depends on the place where you live; for example, rent is more expensive in Milan or Rome than in Turin.
Overall, the process of finding a house takes time, so be patient and don’t be disappointed, especially at the start of the academic year, when new students will arrive, so begin searching earlier.
For the first year, I recommend having your own room in a shared house. Living with Italian flatmates can help you enhance your language skills during your free time too. 😎
If you want to preserve your state scholarship, you must pass specific credits each year, which requires dedication to studying. Most courses, aside from the exam, have a project that should be worked on during the semester, as well as a large amount of material to study DURING the semester; I emphasise DURING because if you study in Iran, you get used to studying a few days before the exam 😅 but this does not work in Italy at all 😣, and you should actively study, and you will most likely pass on the first call, but some exams you can pass or get your desired score after the second or third call. The lowest score is 18 🤌🏼, and the maximum is 30 ✌🏼.
I suggest doing other activities in your free time, such as joining a gym, going to nature, to avoid becoming overwhelmed and burnt out from only studying. 🥵
Thinking about staying in Italy in the future depends on your preferences; if you know Italian well and like good food 🍕🍝🍷(who doesn’t?! 😄) and sunny weather ☀️🌊 ⛱️, then Italy is your place 🤝 or you may prefer to stay in a country that has better facilities for immigrants (like Germany, Netherlands, Belgium or Canada or America).
Italy lacks infrastructure for immigrants; as an example in order to obtain a driver’s licence, I need to know Italian (at the B1 level) or you can get a passport after ten years! While In other countries, you can obtain earlier than this. Also consider that the base salary and expenses are lower in compare with the other countries.
I hope you enjoyed this story, please let me know your feedback or if you want to know more about living in Italy.
Have a nice day and thanks for reading! 🥰

Ciao amico!
Hungry for la vera esperienza italiana? BENVENUTO!
You are at the right place, my friend. Come inside, I will show you what Italy has to offer.
Let’s have a glass of Martini until the ham, olives and cheese magically appear on our plates.
We are having so much fun making them disappear faster than they appeared.
Eros Ramazzotti singing in the background reminds us about how long we have forgotten to feed our souls too. Più bella cosa, Un emozione per sempre, Se bastasse una canzone, Un altra te are food for the soul.
Italy lifts your spirit.
The food makes you want more out of life, the wine melts any sense of separation, the music allows you to be yourself again and the 28 centuries of history still being written are proving that anything is possible.
You can hear Robert De Niro in the background saying on TV that “Italy has changed. But Rome is Rome.”
When you finish the last sip of Martini and the last bite of prosciutto and cheese, you start looking around. You notice photos and paintings from all Italian artists.
Italians don’t need to have the original pieces next to their name. They cherish their ancestors in every home and the original piece is in a place of honor.
Here, everybody’s rich, because everybody has a bit of Da Vinci, Caravaggio and Michelangelo in themselves.
You begin to understand better when you see the quote from the corner of the room “The only wealth which you will keep forever is the wealth you have given away.” — Marcus Aurelius.
The Trevi Fountain took 30 years to be built. The Pantheon is still standing after 2000 years.
This the place where time fades away and eternity reigns, and my wealth is your wealth.
What is time? What is the true wealth?
All the wealth, wisdom and joy are in this very moment and nothing can take them away from you.
The beautiful streets of Rome are taking you now to a different country, Vatican, where you notice how the grandest church out of the 100.000 churches in Italy is taking away all the boundaries between the physical and the spiritual world.
The genius of Michelangelo is shaking your perception of reality.
Life as you know it becomes a dream once you get lost in the divine characther of his creations and the pure nature of the Supreme Consciousness becomes the ‘new’ reality.
You don’t believe God is real until you see the masterpieces of Michelangelo.
After you see them, you don’t believe God isn’t real. Spiritual is material and material is spiritual.
The immaterial has materialized through the human being.
We are all a big family.
And what do big families do in Italy? They eat!
The smell of pizza reignites your senses and the taste takes you through all its 1000 years of history.
The wine makes your soul dance.
Italy is the place where you live in the present fully and completely. Before you go there you live in the future, and after you leave, you live in the past, because the heart will take you there and your soul will stay there long after you’ve left.
Here, at Italy Is My Home, I invite you to discover Italy and to live la vera esperienza italiana.
Join me on this magical journey, the journey of la dolce vita.
You can find more of my posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Diamond. Don’t forget to come back here on Medium anytime you want. You are always welcomed!
Saluti!

Hello you!
If you know me, you know how much I obsess over the movie Eat Pray Love and Julia Roberts’ performance in it. Ever since I watched Julia in the movie enjoying her best life in Italy — living alone, learning Italian, eating pasta (my favorite food) and pizza, drinking lots of wine, and making lovely, warm friends — I knew I wanted that. Here’s the tweet — oh, I mean, X post — I saved up to express this goal of mine.
One of my favourite scenes from the movie is when Julia eats pasta and drinks wine in Italy. That moment, along with her performance, is pure bliss.
Today, I watched Emily in Paris, Season 4, Part 2. Spoiler alert!
I saw a similar scene where Emily and Marchello eat Italian food with the same sense of bliss, making me feel warm and smile. It reminded me how much I longed for that full Italian experience, just like Julia Roberts in Eat Pray Love.
Italy, await me. I’ll see you soon!🥂
Read about what made me smile on Day 16.

Over the past seven years, I’ve lived in Southern Italy for at least three months a year. In the past two years, my partner and I have lived in Italy full-time, most of it in the south.
Between November of 2019 and November of 2021, we hadn’t actually been back to the States. When we finally were able to go back without fear of being denied re-entry to Italy, we realized there were so many little tricks we learned along the way.
My first experience in southern Italy came in the spring, when I flew over from China to visit my mom, who happened to be renting an apartment in a small town.
Coming from the Southeast in America to this small, damp town located in the foothills of the Cilento, my mom had her radiators on full blast.
During one particularly chilly afternoon, we were offered a coffee from a neighbor up the road. When we arrived at her house, we found the entire family in the kitchen, huddled around a TV, fire merrily dancing in the fireplace. The neighbor explained that in the winter, families will retreat to one room, usually the one with a fireplace or wood pellet stove. Gas, the main source of heat, is expensive, and…

Italy is one of those places that one can visit time and again, and always enjoy thoroughly. That’s why we picked it as our next travel-from-home destination, and this time we shared the experience with friends, virtually over Zoom. Below is our digital kit for how you can recreate a similar visit.
To set the mood for our visit we started with Maurizio Carlini’s music and his albums Il Figlio Della Sarta and Er Futuro De ‘Sta Città. There isn’t a ton of information online about Carlini but I stumbled upon his music on Spotify and thought his mellow voice would be perfect while we made dinner.
Afterwards we proceeded with the extensive Perfect Italian Dinner playlist on Spotify whose selection of artists like Marino Marini and Carlo Buti inspired romantic visions of Italy’s bridges, vineyard hills warmed by the summer sun, and little espresso cups lingering on small round tables.
Before we started making dinner, we made a classic Negroni cocktail. The Negroni is a pretty simple cocktail, but we made a quick video of the process: add 1oz. of gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth to a glass. Add ice and stir for a minute. Optionally, express a lemon peel into the cocktail and rub the peel around the lip of the glass.
We also enjoyed a plain S. Pellegrino, Italy’s mineral water which has been produced for over 620 years. With dinner, we opened a bottle of Valle Reale Vigneto di Popoli Montepulciano d’Abruzzo. Its balanced flavor reminds us of the house wine we enjoyed so much with our meals in Italy.
We decided to make ricotta gnocchi and used this simple recipe from Gimme Some Oven, which is adapted from J. Kenji López-Alt’s recipe. It didn’t take long to make and the recipe was very easy to follow, but we made sure to purchase high-quality Ricotta di Bufala, 00 flour, and aged Parmigiano-Reggiano. After boiling the gnocchi, we tossed them in an Arrabbiata sauce, topped with fresh Mozzarella, and broiled until the cheese was bubbling and browned.
For dessert we sampled some Bodrato dark chocolate and our friends tasted classic tiramisu and Italian sorbet.
Initially I wanted to tell my friends about the Italian novelist Elena Ferrante whose Neapolitan novels I adore, but since this is her pseudonym and we don’t know much about her, I decided to go down the poetry route and learn about a contemporary Italian poet, so I found Patrizia Cavalli.
Born in Todi, Cavalli is much loved in Italy and is one of the most recognized modern Italian poets in the world today. The Booklist described her poetry collection My Poems Won’t Change the World (2013) (English translation is available) as a “must-read for fans of contemporary poetry.” Poetry Foundation discusses Cavalli’s style as conversational, focused on the simplicity of the everyday -
One thinks of Sylvia Plath, perhaps, or Anne Sexton: a poetry far from the great events, founded on the candor of individual confession and the intensification of the everyday, often stylistically stingy (conversational, paratactical, metrically lax), as in these lines by Patrizia Cavalli:
If you were to knock now on my doorand if you took your glasses offand I took off mine which are just like yoursand if you then entered into my mouthunafraid of kisses that are not alikeand said to me: “My love,what has happened?” — it would bea successful bit of theater.
— From My Very Own Singular “I”
I also think her poem [The happy ones are almost always also vulgar] is especially relevant for our hurried life, recently interrupted by Covid-19:
The happy ones are almost always also vulgar;happiness has a way of thinkingthat’s rushed and has no time to lookbut keeps on moving, compact and manic,with contempt in passing for the dying:
Get on with your life, come on, buck up!Those stilled by pain don’t mixwith the cheerful, self-assured runnersbut with those who walk at the same slow pace.
If one wheel locks and the other’s turningthe turning one doesn’t stop turningbut goes as far as it can, dragging the otherin a poor, skewed race until the carteither comes to a halt or falls apart.
One of the best parts of sharing our experience with friends is that we all reflected back on our visits to Italy, our favorite moments and impressions. We had all visited Florence so we spent some time talking about the Uffizi art gallery there. Our friend Ivan told us about how struck he was by Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Painted on canvas in the 15th century, this work of art shows Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, standing on a giant scallop shell and covering her nakedness with long, blond hair. You can zoom in on the painting on the Uffizi’s website.
Our friend Zhanina who is an architect told us about someone we should have probably already known about: Renzo Piano. Piano is a world-known Italian architect and his notable buildings include the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (with Richard Rogers, 1977), The Shard in London (2012), the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City (2015) and Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens (2016).
He is known for his clean, simple lines, and people-centric philosophy. His firm Renzo Piano Building Workshop (RPBW) seeks to achieve a sense of lightness. As its website says,
This might mean finding innovative methods to diffuse natural light over a world-class art collection, or angling a roof so a new building does not cast shadow over a city park.
Zhanina told us that Paino designed the new wing of Boston’s Isabella Gardner Museum as well as the Harvard Art Gallery. We’ve visited both of these museums often and never realized who was behind their beauty and light.
Tarantella is a traditional couple folk dance Italian dance during which the women dancers frequently carry tambourines. Britannica says that, “The tarantella’s origin is connected with tarantism, a disease or form of hysteria that appeared in Italy in the 15th to the 17th century and that was obscurely associated with the bite of the tarantula spider; victims seemingly were cured by frenzied dancing.”
While its origins sound a bit bleak, the dance is very upbeat and happy and we enjoyed mimicking the movements of these two dancers on YouTube. Especially after all of the food and drinks we had consumed, we welcomed the fun and movement this brought.
We decided to watch No Reservations | Emilia Romagna with Anthony Bourdain and it was the perfect ending of this immersive experience. We learned about the making of balsamic vinegar, Sangiovese wine, and a variety of meats and cheeses. It was so refreshing to see the craftspeople featured in the episode show such passion for and pride in their work.
Our trip to Italy was a dream, and sharing it with friends encouraged us to reflect on each component of this experience and made it richer. Hope these suggestions help you design a special trip to Italy, even if it’s just from home.

Why Saying ‘Arrivederci’ to ‘Careless’ Meat and Cheese is Key to Restoring Italy’s Relationship with Food
I’ll never forget my summer road trip through the land of gastronomy. I spent several days touring Italy’s most fertile agricultural valley. I marveled at the pretty villages with picturesque churches and hilly backdrops. The endless pastures and crop fields. The balmy days of blue skies and t-shirt temperatures. Friendly people at every turn. And the smell of the most delicious food.
No wonder Italy is so widely cited as the world’s number one for cuisine. Whether pizzas, pastas or gnocchi served with a myriad of flavours, Italy seems to have it all.
Italian food engenders an exhilaration like no other; what world-renowned Italian chef, Giorgio Locatelli describes as the “the relationship between food, sex, wine and the excitement of life”.
Except, there was something missing. In my days traversing the fields, valleys and plains of the rich Italian countryside, I never once saw a farm animal outside. It was an irony that has stayed with me ever since.
Where were the cows producing milk for world-famous Parmesan or Grana Padano? Or the pigs renowned for Parma ham? Or the chickens producing eggs for Carbonara?
Quality not quantity
What I discovered is that farmers in Italy’s richest agricultural region had forgotten how to keep animals outside. They simply had a blind spot. They couldn’t see why it wasn’t right to keep them cooped up indoors all day, every day. They couldn’t see the irony of grass being grown then mowed and packed into bales to feed incarcerated cows.
They had lost sight of the fact that cows, pigs, and chickens like to feel fresh air and sunshine as much as we do.
It put me in mind of something else Locatelli once said: “It is better to have fantastic meat once a week than fill ourselves up every day with cheap, carelessly reared meat. We all have to get used to quality, not quantity.”
Famous cheeses
The most surprising discovery on my travels through the Italian countryside was the way dairy cows were kept, not least for those world-renowned iconic cheeses of Parmesan and Grana Padano.
I remember checking the production details for Parmesan and Grana Padano and finding they both mentioned the cows being raised on fresh grass and hay.
But cows wandering the fields, gently tugging at grassy stalks or chewing the cud under the shade of trees, were conspicuous by their absence; the only cows I could find were crammed into darkened sheds.
I remember seeing a hundred cows peering out of a single square shed. They were trapped inside but had a perfect view of the lush pasture they were prevented from grazing on.
I watched incredulously as heavy goods vehicles delivered grass to a processing plant. A yellow tractor scooped grass into a giant machine, while yet more trucks took compacted blocks of grass and drove them away.
Instead of letting the animals graze in a time-honoured fashion, mechanically pressed bales were being produced to feed confined cattle.
What happened to cow paradise?
In what should have been a cow’s paradise, nature’s way had been abandoned.
According to the Grana Padano consortium, 80 per cent of their cows are denied pasture access with approximately 40 per cent confined indoors, not even having outdoor ‘paddocks’.
It reinforced my impression that we now have a generation of cattle farmers in Italy that simply don’t know how to keep animals as nature intended — on pasture.
I wondered whether things were now different for those cows milked for Parmesan — or Parmigiano Reggiano to give its full name. Surely, this ‘king of cheeses’ would be made from the milk of cows that are kept on grass?
Like Grana Padano and many other regional foods, strict rules govern the manufacture of Parmesan. Given its protected status, only cheesemakers from Parma, Reggio Emilia, parts of Bologna, Modena and Mantua can qualify.
My enquiries to the Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano Reggiano, the consortium that governs the manufacture of Parmesan in 2016 resulted in them sharing that the proportion of cows grazing freely in fields for them during the summer months was “very low”.
I was told that there were few exceptions, perhaps as few as one per cent of their farms had cows out grazing. In 2023, I asked them for an update and received no reply.
Known as ‘zero-grazing’ — keeping cows indoors permanently — I subsequently found that it was common practice all over Italy.
As Kees de Roest wrote in The Production of Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese: The Force of an Artisanal System in an Industrialised World, ‘almost all Italian dairy farms apply the zero-grazing system’.
Whilst cows are confined indoors, Italy’s crop fields are often dedicated to growing feed for them rather than food for people.
Unsustainable
About half of Italy’s cereal crop is used to feed intensively reared animals. In addition, the country is a big importer of soya, importing about 3 million tonnes a year, much of which is used to feed industrially reared animals.
Farmed animals are now spookily conspicuous by their absence from the fields and valleys of Italy’s Po Valley.
Which reminded me of those prophetic words by Italian chef, Giorgio Locatelli who warned against eating cheap, carelessly reared meat, saying, “We all have to get used to quality, not quantity.”
Putting quality back on our plate seems the right ingredient for ensuring that Italian cuisine once again reflects that fabled relationship between food, sex, wine and the excitement of life.
Saying ‘arrivederci’ to keeping cows permanently indoors should be a big part of a recipe for nature-friendly food for the future.

Originally written for The Unexplorer.
Every day, I learn something more about my new home in Calabria, Italy. I now laugh at how much I DIDN’T know before I moved to Italy. Hopefully, this post will help you gain a few more nuggets of wisdom if you’re planning to relocate to Italy!
I’ll be in the middle of a deep conversation with a friend or my boyfriend and then the phone rings. 98% of the time, they’ll answer.
While many Americans also keep their ringers on and answer or respond to texts, by far, the Italians have them beat. They will respond no matter what they’re doing. (Do not ask me to elaborate. You can use your imagination here!)
And if they’re the ones calling and if they get no answer, they’ll call again. And again. And again. Italian phone numbers don’t have voicemail, so you can let the phone ring until tomorrow if you want.
This is one frustration I haven’t gotten over. I feel like when you’re with people in person, they should be your focus, not whoever’s calling to shoot the shit.

I grew up in Lombardy, the richest, most populous and productive region in Italy. It is the Italian region with the most UNESCO World Heritage sites, but you have probably heard of it because of A.C. Milan, Inter Milan, Lake Garda, Italian black caviar, or Franciacorta wines.
To be more precise, I spent most of my early life in a small town where almost everyone could speak a variation of the Lombard language, even foreigners. It took me years to realize that what I just described is an extraordinary linguistic context, even for Italian standards. It was not until I turned fifteen and started dealing with students coming from other towns and cities that I truly become aware of how few people were fluent in that language.
Eventually, it turned out that I am part of the 12.2% of the Italian population who actively speaks a local language. Needless to say, this sad statistic makes it clear how endangered those local languages are. You might be wondering why this is happening. But first, let’s delve into Italy’s linguistic heritage.
As you can see in the image below, the Italian linguistic context is incredibly complex.
Tullio De Mauro, the most famous Italian linguist who ever lived, identified thirteen minor languages in Italy in addition to Italian. Then, each of them consists of dozens of local variations, bringing the number of languages spoken in Italy to a few hundred.
Most of these languages evolved locally from Vulgar Latin and are not directly related to Italian, but they are erroneously called “dialects”. Consequently, you will also hear of them as “Italian dialects”, even though they are languages and not dialects.
According to this study, only 25.2% of Italians use both their local dialect and Italian in their daily lives, while only 12.2% actively speak their local dialect. Furthermore, as discovered by ISTAT in 2006, 55.1% of Italians can only speak the Italian language. This makes those wrongly-called dialects endangered languages that will probably disappear in a few decades.
Many Italian grandparents have nostalgic memories of the days when they spoke and wrote their true language. Notice that I did not use the term “true” by accident. Keep in mind that the Italian language was imposed on all Italian citizens in 1861, when the Kingdom of Italy was founded.
So, even in the early 1900s, Italian was still a new language to many people, especially those who lived in rural or poor areas. These people never really considered Italian as their language. During those years, the disappearance of those local languages began.
Since the beginning of 1900, nothing really important has been done to stop this phenomenon. On the contrary, the Italian government seemed to have favored the death of these local languages more than once. Perhaps, because these languages represent more an encumbrance and a burden than a cultural heritage to protect. In this sense, only in the last few years has there been a change.
What is for sure is that when all the languages of Italy are gone forever, hundreds of years of Italy’s cultural, social, and human heritage will be lost. This will be a slow process where the Italian linguistic context will become less and less diversified with the unstoppable demise of all the wise Italian elders who are keeping those languages alive.
Many think that the death of these languages is an inevitable effect of globalization, especially considering how most young Italians prefer to learn English instead of their local language as a second language. On the other hand, young people usually stop studying English after graduating and consequently slowly forget it.
Also, people moving abroad for a brighter future tend to forget their native language or abandon it to better integrate into the new culture. Something similar happened in the past when poor families moved to the cities to find fortune. In this case, the “dialects” represented a social barrier because rich families only spoke Italian. So, the newly arrived poor people were pressured to hide their local accent and suppress their language to avoid discrimination.
According to the UNESCO’s Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, there are 31 languages classified as endangered in Italy. Each of them has a different level of endangerment, from safe to extinct.
You can get an idea of the adoption of these languages as principal languages by households living in Italy thanks to the following map produced by ISTAT in 2015:
As you can see, there is not much hope for these endangered languages, especially in northeastern and central-northern Italy. As a language learner and someone who is able to speak a local language and who uses it on a daily basis, it is really a shame and a disappointment to see the disappearance of this incredible linguistic heritage.
Here we looked at how diversified and vast the linguistic context in Italy really is. In detail, there are more than 30 endangered languages that might disappear soon, and understanding the reason why this is happening is what drove me to write this article.
Thanks for reading! I hope that you found my story helpful. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments, or suggestions.

Italy has to be on everyone’s travel shortlist — and, for a long time, it was on mine as well. It’s a destination like Paris or London or Tokyo that fills people with wonder and has an iconic feeling thanks to Hollywood and everyone’s brag-worthy Insta shots.
I can’t say why we hadn’t made it to Italy yet. We’ve been working our way through Europe country-by-country, mainly as add-ons to my work trips. There are other places I’ve gravitated towards first because they have been a bit higher on my list. We also took a massive three-week trip in 2013, and while we went to Portugal and Spain, Italy didn’t make the cut.
But I happened to have a work trip to Zurich for The Company in December, and since we did Denmark and Sweden the following year in November and froze to death, we decided to go south this trip and finally check Italy off of the list.
Italy was disappointing.
That’s not a popular sentiment. I’m dear friends with many Italophiles, and I love them and trust their opinions, but I’ve since learned that I don’t have to love all destinations equally. And Italy just isn’t my jam.
I tried to break this down into broader categories, and I realized that there are a few things that I look for when I travel:
Order: If we think about a continuum from order to chaos, I’m a lover of order. I find that chaotic places can be somewhat anxiety-triggering, but beyond that I find a smoother travel experience when it’s easy to get from A to B and when people know how to queue in lines in an orderly fashion. Even if it’s not the structure that I know, I’m happy to stand back and observe the rules and adapt to them.
Politeness: A close cousin to order is the politeness of the people in individual interactions. Are people open and kind? Do they hold doors, try to stay quieter at night, or stand up to give seats on transit for expectant mothers? When you treat someone with respect, do they respond in kind?
Warmth: How welcome do you feel, even if you are different? Do people welcome you into their lives and their families? One country that feels incredibly warm to me is Mexico — just pull up a chair and join the family! You are welcome no matter who you are and feel that people genuinely care about you.
History/Culture/Stuff to Do: This is actually the easiest requirement of all because I find so many things interesting! I can find something interesting in almost any place.
[Note: One huge exception here is camping. I don’t camp. I hate it and I refuse to spend my vacation doing something I can’t stand. So if camping is the attraction, or the accommodation, I’m out.]
So when I step back and think about my favorite trips I’ve ever taken, it’s not surprising that they would score highly across the board. If I were to rate my favorites, the top three thus far are Australia, Austria, and Hawai’i. Each of these is quite different, with different things that attract me, and each has their own detractions (scary creatures, weather, humidity, excess sand, etc.), but they are places that have a good orderliness, polite and warm people, and interesting cultural sites and activities.
The big attraction to Italy was the culture and the history. It’s the freakin’ Roman empire — how amazing to visit a society that was such a powerhouse for a thousand years! So when I think about the highlights of our visit to Rome and Florence, these cultural attractions made the biggest impression on us.
But Italy did not score so well in the categories of order, politeness, and warmth. Whenever I mention this to an Italophile they express one of two things. First, they might express regret that I didn’t experience the Italy that they love (one dear friend said, “Well, by the fifth or sixth time Italy is amazing!” which made me laugh that I’d have to do four more trips like this to discover the charm of the place). And I can see that this could be true because there were pockets of warmth. There was the amazing B&B host in Florence who gave us a mini walking tour around the B&B and kept adding recommendations to our map (to the point that I kept feeling bad that he was taking up so much time). We had some very kind servers at some of the restaurants in Rome, especially those we visited in the Jewish quarter.
But this was not a country filled with politeness or order. It felt a lot like Portugal — a city that was once great but that was, quite literally, in decay. I found the Italians en masse to be loud, pushy (literally) and rude. Sometimes their aggression is well-served — say, in the way that they drive — but in other cases it just seemed misplaced.
I have some empathy for what Romans must experience, living in a city that every idiot tourist in the world wants to visit. They tromp off of their air-conditioned coaches in khaki shorts and big white tennis shoes, stopping in the center of the sidewalk to unfurl their maps or position their selfie sticks. I get it. These are the same idiots that show up in Seattle in June, July, and August.
What frustrates the crap out of me is that we work very, very hard to not be that kind of tourist. I’ve found that learning some of the local language can be incredibly helpful. I’ll never forget my first trip to France with some friends. One of them refused to say “Bonjour” when we entered shops, instead saying “HI!” in a super-American accent. Greetings are one of the simplest ways to show respect of other cultures — it doesn’t take more than 30 minutes to learn five basic phrases in a language, and now that we have the Internet, there’s no excuse!
When it came to Italian, I spent two months learning a bit more than the basics on DuoLingo. Yes, it did help a little, but in most cases it helps grease the skids for moments of connection. Not in Italy. Not at all.
Two other simple adjustments we make when we travel is in the way that we dress and the way that we behave in public. If you’ve ever been on a train in Germany or a flight in Sweden you’ll notice how quietly people converse, mindful of the shared spaces that they are in. These are places where one doesn’t need to draw attention to oneself through behavior or dress. Dressing for the road is actually rather simple — we wear clothing that is classic and plain, or in muted patterns (like stripes, small checks, or small florals). We ditch the clothes with words and jokes and logos to go for the pan-European look. Because of how we look physically people are often unsure where we’re from (no one ever guesses Mexico for Sergio!), and because of this we can “pass” for different nationalities. The best compliment to me when traveling in Europe is for someone to think I am Swiss or German (but I’ll take Canadian!), and I take a lot of joy when I say that I am American — just one who is considerate in other countries!
All of this amounted to nothing in Italy. No amount of blending behavior worked at all. Maybe that’s because we weren’t blending with the culture? But even if you can’t blend, I had hoped there would be some appreciation that we weren’t obnoxious.
In the end, I think my experience of traveling in Italy was very much like my travels to New York City. It’s not popular to say this, but I’m not a fan of NYC. Sure — there are lots of things to do and see. I love the museums and the shows and the food. But it entirely lacks in charm and warmth, not to mention trees (I’ll give Rome this — they do have some trees here and there).
One last note, and that’s food. Food might be the fifth category, if there is one. My opinion on food has changed since I’ve modified my diet (no dairy plus I follow a modified version of the FODMAP diet) — I’m interested in the local cuisine, but in some countries the choice foods aren’t something I can eat. Italy is a great example — most pizza and pasta is covered in cheese, a big no-no for me.
I admit that we sinned big one night and had lasagna, which was delicious and worth the stomachache. Italian food was good, but since it’s widely available, there wasn’t much about it that felt so special that I could only get it there. This is different than some other cuisines where it is very difficult to get authentic cuisine outside of the place. Have you ever had amazing barramundi in the US? What about perfect shave ice outside of Hawai’i? Or flødeboller outside of Scandinavia? Or perfect spaetzle and strudel outside of Bavaria?
So that’s that. Italy turned out to be a bit of a bomb for me. We don’t have any upcoming work trips planned to Europe, but we do have a big trip planned in the spring! For something completely different, we’re going to Norway, Estonia, and Finland! To say that I’m excited is an understatement. A fair bit of my heritage is Norwegian (with a bit of Swedish and Finnish thrown in for luck), so I’m excited to visit Norway in particular. We’ve also visited both Denmark and Sweden, and while the Scandinavians aren’t the warmest people when you first meet them, those countries score off-the-charts on order, politeness, and history! I’m going to start learning basic Norwegian phrases next month!
Ciao for now, Sarah

After 15 years of transcontinental trips, I finally accomplished my goal of visiting all 20 regions of Italy (magically, just before the pandemic hit). I will continue to return over and over, as there is so much more to see and do and learn, but in this blog series I look back, through the rear-view mirror, and share some of the highlights I discovered along the way — One region at a time.
Piedmont sits in northwest Italy, bordered by France and Switzerland, as well as by the Italian regions of Aosta, Lombardy, and Liguria. As its name suggests, Piedmont lies at the foot (pie) of the mountains (monte). Italy’s second largest region, it is surrounded by mountains on three sides and is home to many of the highest peaks and largest glaciers in Italy. The landscape is incredibly diverse, from rugged peaks to rolling hills covered with vineyards, to rice fields and plains.
Turin is the regional capital, was the first capital city of Italy, and for centuries before that was the heart of the Kingdom of Savoy. Not surprising, the city is rich in history and culture. A mix of elegant Baroque, Neo-classical and Art Nouveau architecture (more reminiscent of Paris and Vienna than Rome and Naples), combined with broad, portico-lined streets, sets its historic centre apart. Many of Italy’s more traditional medieval centres that I have visited (e.g., Florence, Siena, Bologna) tend to have narrow, haphazard streets, and stocky Romanesque architecture. The differences are striking
My experiences in Piedmont (Piemonte) centred around Turin, where I spent 2 weeks during the World Masters Games (2013) and Monferrato, where I spent 3 weeks working at a winery and agriturismo (2019). I also felt compelled to return to both place in 2021, to reconnect with friends from my earlier visits. My eyes were opened wider with each visit.
La Casaccia Agriturismo and Winery sits about an hour east of Turin. For some background, I was at La Casaccia as a volunteer, working in exchange for room and board (part of an exchange program called WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms that I highly recommend for anyone who wants an authentic Italian experience). For me it was a way to extend my stays in Italy without breaking the bank, to practise my Italian and, as much as possible, to live like a local. Mission accomplished!
I chose La Casaccia for several reasons. A major draw was its location in Piedmont, a region I wanted to spend more time exploring. The fact that La Casaccia was a B&B /agriturismo as well as a winery was also appealing, as I was sure to learn more as I helped out in the variety of activities. It turned out to be an amazing experience with a wonderful host family. I did everything from preparing breakfast for B&B guests to working in the garden and kitchen (where I learned some local recipes), to working in the cellars and vineyards (helping prepare for and participate in the vendemmia, or wine harvest, as well as in the production process for the various organic wines they made). I loved every minute of it, and my return visit 2 years later felt like a family reunion.
While at La Casaccia, I also had the luxury of exploring the area on electric bikes the family owned. Something I highly recommend if you get the chance, particularly since the area is quite hilly. The vineyard landscapes of Langhe Roere and Monferrato that I biked through are a designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Piedmont is a spectacular region of Italy. My visits offered just a glimpse of what it has to offer. Click here for more information about Piedmont and here for information on the Monferrato wine region and its wines.
I look forward to hearing from you about your highlights from Piedmont, whether you are a travel enthusiast, lover of Italy, reader, writer (or all of the above!) and especially about your experiences getting off the trodden path and seeing Italy from all its amazing angles.

So far, I’ve been to 43 major cities, 28 states, 9 countries, and I have no intention of stopping any time soon. Until the Grim Reaper pays me a visit, I’m going to travel as far as I can while I can.
Even if Mr. Reaper knocks at my door, I may tell him to “Piss off and come back later. My next trip is booked.” 🖕 #redheadattitude
I’ve had great memories at most of my destinations, but which one was the best?
Hands down, the Amalfi Coast.
Located on the western shores of Italy, this was a mother-daughter trip scheduled in 2020 and then canceled due to COVID concerns. That same year, my father passed away, my gallbladder ruptured, and my husband had a heart attack. Needless to say, 2020 was not my best year.

FOR weeks, a question had been nagging at my mind. What gives Italians their enormous self-belief while the rest of Europe is a festering mess of anxieties, neuroses and self-doubt?
It was not until just days before I was due to fly back to Australia after three-and-a-half weeks in Italy, while walking up the long driveway to our villa in Tuscany late one afternoon, that I finally understood what makes the country tick.
A month before we arrived, Italy’s leaders had been grappling to resolve one of the frequent political crises which have been a common thread in the nation’s postwar history.
And for most of our stay, the other giants of Europe — Germany, France, England, Spain, Russia — along with a host of minnows chased sport’s ultimate prize, the FIFA World Cup, while the Italians watched from afar, having failed to qualify.
Both events would be a severe test of a nation’s self-confidence, but the Italians seemed to take them in their stride.
These are testing times for Europeans, with a rise in xenophobic nationalism and risks of a splintering if the postwar consensus which has provided security and economic stability since the late-1940s.
Italy is no different, but its natives’ confidence and identity are unshakeable.
The most recent political crisis came after the March elections which resulted in a hung parliament which was only resolved on 1 June with the formation of a coalition between Matteo Salvini’s right-wing League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement led by Luigi Di Maio.
There were moments of farce in the lead up to the government being formed after president Sergio Mattarella rejected the coalition’s choice of Eurosceptic finance minister, and in turn its nominated prime minister Giuseppe Conte and instead directed Carlo Cottarelli to form a new government.
Five days later, on 1 June, after intense negotiations, Cotarelli, withdrew and the original choice, Conte, became prime minister.
Italian politics as usual, sniggered the rest of the world. But with their unshakeable self-belief, the Italians just shrugged their shoulders.
After all, just look at Britain, where the government is being torn apart by the hard and soft Brexit factions and the prime minister is looking more and more like a gormless puppet with each passing day; and the US, fast becoming a global pariah under the monstrous Trump. Or Australia, for that matter, where replacing a prime minister in the middle of their term in office has become a national blood sport.
It is the same with football. Once the shock had passed, Italians found another country or another player to root for, and the World Cup telecasts were the highest rating on record. They know the Azzuri will be back in the big league soon, and in the meantime they can point to the four stars on their national shirts, three more than the English, the last won just a dozen years ago. And didn’t the world’s best player, Cristiano Ronaldo, choose Juventus in the Italian Serie A for the next stage of his career?
Italians literally do not give a shit that you might think that their politics is a bit of a joke, that its byzantine bureaucracy is slow and frustrating, that their economy is riddled with nepotism and corruption, that the crumbling infrastructure is sometimes not much better than the third world, or that their cities are full of pollution caused by all those Vespas buzzing around and could do with a clean up.
Spend a few weeks in Italy, and you being to understand where this immense well of self-confidence, almost swagger, comes from.
It starts with their country’s gorgeous natural and built environment. Italians live on a peninsula of extremes: tiny villages perched on the edge of cliffs that plunge straight into crystal clear blue seas; exquisitely preserved centres of renaissance power; and modern cities where 2000-year-old Roman ruins are just part of the everyday backdrop. A country that can offer us both Venice and Naples, Cinque Terre and San Gimignano.
Indeed, there are days when you find yourself thinking that Italy is too good for the Italians. Do they care? Of course not — they get to live there all the time, while we are just passing through as envious tourists.
It’s the confidence that comes from knowing that your ancestors were conquering most of the known world and devising modern systems of politics, language and culture when others were still trying to work out how to invent the wheel.
And a millennium later, when others were still stuck in the dark ages, your ancestors were at it again, leading the European renaissance and leaving a legacy in art, architecture, commerce and literature that has yet to be surpassed.
It’s the confidence that comes from knowing that your ancient language forms the basis of how hundreds of millions of people speak today. It’s the confidence from knowing that your food, your clothes, the way you carry yourself, has spread to and is imitated in every corner of the world.
Is there any other culture — apart from Chinese — which has so successfully achieved global ubiquity as Italian culture, yet at the same time resisted homogenisation?
Every time we eat a slice of pizza, drink a cappuccino, slip into a Versace or Armani item of clothing, worship at a Catholic Church, or watch a television drama about the Mafia, we are unconsciously paying homage to Italy (for good or ill).
Perhaps Italy’s greatest export has been its people; it was the Italian disapora who were the foot soldiers of the peaceful cultural invasion that assures Italy of its place in the world, even as their mother country’s economic, political and military clout falls down the ladder.
And back in Italy, it is this knowledge that they have been the world’s greatest cultural colonisers that gives Italians their self-confidence.
While Italy’s other great European rivals — France, Germany and Britain — engage in public handwringing bouts of self-doubt and identity crises, the Italians maintain this solid belief in themselves.
Of course, Italy shed any serious empire-building ambitions long ago, about the time the barbarians set fire to ancient Rome. So unlike France or England, it never embarked on colonialism in the 18th or 19th centuries. Modern Britain and modern France have undoubtedly benefited from the cultural influences brought by migrants from their former colonial outposts — can you imagine London without the Indian or Jamaican communities, or Paris without its Algerian and Moroccan communities?
But it’s also undeniable that multiculturalism has brought its own tensions which have been exploited by the xenophobic right throughout Europe, but especially in Britain and France.
Italy, by contrast, still remains a much more monocultural nation, yet the recent election which brought the far right Salvini into government as Interior Minister has also brought a more sinister racist tone to Italian politics.
But it remains that if Italians suffer any anxiety about their national identity, it stems more from the centuries of rivalry between the sophisticated north and the sensual south. Remember that until less than 200 years ago, Italy was not a single nation, but a patchwork of small kingdoms and principalities, and uniting them remains an ongoing project.
My maternal grandparents came to Australia from the northern province of Friuli in the 1920s, but despite visiting Italy three previous times before this year, I have always had an ambivlence about my ancestry.
After this most recent visit, I still can’t say I feel Italian, nor has Italy become my favourite European destination. But at least I understand now what it is to be Italian.
*A note about the photograph at the top of this story: This photo was taken late in the afternoon at the corner of Via del Corso and Via Laurina in Rome, near the Piazza del Popolo. I spent a long period waiting for the right image to appear in my camera’s viewfinder and couldn’t believe my luck when this woman floated into the light. It was only later, on my computer, that I noticed that the man in the red shirt had wandered into frame at the exact moment I clicked the shutter. At first, I thought he’d ruined the photo, but on reflection, his plainness only enhances the ethereal beauty of the woman in the light, who looks as if she’s been transplanted from a Renaissance masterpiece.

A few weeks back we asked our followers on Twitter what they think are some of the most loved destinations in Italy. The response was quite incredible.
“This will probably be the easiest question I get to answer all day,” writes one of our followers after telling us that his favorite destination is Capri, in the Campania region.
Others mentioned their heritage and origins: “Costa Smeralda, Sardegna,” writes Jonathan, mentioning that his mother is from Santa Teresa di Gallura.
And others admitted “it’s too hard to choose,” as writes Darlene, whose favorite destinations are Pienza in Tuscany, and Capri and Positano in Campania. “So tough to choose,” says Ishita, mentioning Montestigliano in Tuscany.
Kevin didn’t write anything, but responded with a beautiful photo of Florence.
Here are some additional destinations that our Twitter followers highlighted, from small towns to large areas who every year attract tourists from the US and around the world: Amalfi Coast, Budelli Island, Crotone, Guardia Snaframondi (Benevento), Lucca, Monte Argentario, Napoli, Porto Santo Stefano, Salento, Sicily, Taormina.
In March, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) said that overall, the total contribution of the travel and tourism industries to the Italian economy was €223.2 billion in 2017, once all the direct, indirect and induced benefits were taken into account. The report mentioned that, not only Italy is the 6th largest travel economy in the world, but the industry supported 3.4 million jobs in 2017 with an estimate of 4 million jobs by 2028.
So, what is your favorite destination in Italy?

When I embarked on my Italian wine journey nearly three years ago, I could have never imagined having to face a worldwide health crisis here in Italy, or anywhere, for that matter.
Rather than recount grave tales of the current quarantine situation, I wanted to share what I’ve only now realized my fellow Italian citizens have taught me.
It’s been said a million times before, but now, more than ever, we need to remember that we cannot predict or control every aspect of our lives. As an American, this is something I’ve found very hard to accept. Living amongst a population of people who contrastingly seem to embrace unpredictability, has shed a spotlight on my inability to do so.
From my first days working on a beautiful vineyard in central Italy, I wanted to know exactly what I’d be doing when. I’d inquire about lunchtime, dinner time, and my future tasks for the upcoming week, often met by quizzical and unspecific replies. “We’ll pause for lunch when we’re done with these rows”, pointing to an undefined plot of vines, or “when we pick enough Trebbiano for today,” the winemaker would tell me.
Gone were the days of living confined to my office calendar, handcuffed to the rigid meetings, scheduled a month or more in advance. Countless more examples in the Italian countryside, as well as in my current city of Bologna, reinforce that Italians innately embrace the present, instead of wasting time obsessing about the future.
This take-things-as-they-come mindset has proven very beneficial in combating hysteria and fear during these now uncertain times of Coronavirus. Italy and the majority of its people are not overly panicking about tomorrow or being frightened by media reports from abroad.
Despite exaggerated accounts, Italians are not hoarding groceries and fighting in stores, as I’ve witnessed with every prediction of 6 inches of snow in the U.S. They focus their energy on dealing with the day at hand, taking time to prepare for the next, but never forgetting to find a few minutes to laugh and be grateful to be alive.
Unless of course, we’re talking about a football (soccer) match, Italians have shown me that life is much more than a series of back-to-back competitions. In America, we are groomed for competition from birth — just look at the insanity surrounding pre-school admissions. Parents in many parts of the US are forced to apply for pre-school the moment their child is born, in fear of being left out in the cold once their child approaches school-age — 3 years later.
From elementary school through high school, the competition only increases with each passing year. Immense pressure is put on students to outperform one another, gain entry to the highest classes, most prestigious clubs, teams, and of course colleges. Pre-SATs, SATs, state proficiency exams, and class-rankings pit every student against each other, creating tremendous anxiety and comparisons amongst impressionable teenagers.
In the US, very rarely are students encouraged, or afforded the time, to help one another succeed. Instead, they are told to focus on grades, activities, transcripts and overall peer-group standing. Fierce competition for the few coveted spots at elite and popular universities drives an inordinate amount of stress and do-whatever-it-takes approach. Parents and students resort to insane, sometimes illegal, measures to gain advantages and excel above the next student. Only now, are people finally being held accountable for admissions cheating scandals.
This cut-throat competition and dog-eat-dog mentality does not permeate society in Italy or most parts of Western Europe. Many factors contribute to this of course, but one major reason is that most European universities are public and accessible to all citizens, for free, or very little money. It’s been truly eye-opening to see how much this one difference can affect a nation’s culture and mindset of its society.
In Italy, children and teenagers can grow up without the looming fear of college admissions hanging above their heads. I’d argue, this results in Italians being less individualistic and hostile towards one another, from an early age. Family values are emphasized instead of GPAs, and more time is spent cultivating relationships and passing on priceless traditions. Additionally, students generally dedicate more time to their passions, communities, and appreciation of the arts.
Consequently, many Italian adults have numerous “job titles”, such as a lawyer by day, cheesemaker by night. It’s also common for people to work across various industries, instead of being pigeonholed into one. The freedom that comes with guaranteed higher education creates more opportunities to become successful in a field of your choosing, rather than a field that can most-efficiently pay off $100k+ student debt — as is often the case in America.
While competition is, of course, healthy, especially in business, I think we Americans often forget that life itself is not a competition. We must strive for meaningful lives — not only aim for high test scores, job-titles, and bank accounts, simply to out-shine the next person.
Italy’s economy is far from perfect, however, living in this country during good times, and recent times of difficulty has proven to me that quality of life defines a country much more than its GDP. Italians have come together to face this crisis as a unified and optimistic society, something I’m very proud to be a part of, now, more than ever.
#Andràtuttobene — Everything will be alright.

February 13, 2013.
We finally felt ready to start our Europe tourist circuits since our kids have grown enough to be able to sustain the walking around and making use of the full days you spend on this wonderful vacationing continent. Italy and Switzerland combination is what we picked — one country full of history, culture, art and character while the other is one of the most endowed places by nature gods. They are next to each other in Europe so no long intra-continent travel was involved. After much research we decided to drive around Italy and use the train system in Switzerland. I thought that was a great choice and would highly recommend doing that.
We have been doing a whole lot of trips in Asia and in the Americas and so making reservations and planning this trip to Europe was a new experience. Help of experienced friends, internet booking sites and plenty of travel tips from people on Trip advisor was a big help. Things like booking entry into the St Mark’s Basilica beforehand, the use of skip the line tour booking for Vatican, staying in Lauterbrunnen instead of Interlaken, car seat requirements in Europe, making sure about Air conditioning & parking spaces in hotels, keeping passports & cash safe, and second class Swiss pass is good enough (no need for first class) were some very useful tips. Our experience with Emirates for Flights, and Booking.com for booking hotels was very good. For planning our itinerary we used a combination of Frommer’s and Trip advisor write-ups. I also downloaded Rick Martin’s audio guides for Rome, Vatican and Venice — this helped me plan our days better.
Emirates flies 3 times a day from Hyderabad and connects very well to all locations in Europe. So we took nice and comfortable Emirates flights and landed in Rome on July 13th. The immigration process was the quickest I have seen — literally open the passport on visa page and stamp it. The Baggage area seemed old & run down as compared to all the new Indian airports and we had a broken wheel for our duffle bag — not the greatest start. But the airport pick up service we had booked from our hotel Fiume was good and the lady driver was friendly, took us through the Ancient Rome scenic drive — and we had our first breath taking view of the Colosseum — it was late evening so it was lighted up and looked majestic.
Although it was about 10pm by the time we were checked in and settled in the room, we wanted to just get started. So took a map and asked for basic directions from the hotel desk and walked through beutiful Rome streets to Spanish Steps. So one tip is to stay in the city boundary in Rome and second it is incredibly safe & the city is alive till quite late in the night, 1am or so. We clicked a few snaps and then took a rickshaw ride to Trevi Fountain, where we had our first pizza / pasta dinner. The fountain itself was a beautiful site in the night and we just sat on the steps with lot of people around till quite late.
July 14th we had a 10:30 am booking with “What A Life Tours” company for the guided tour of Vatican and Sistine Chapel. We used a taxi to make sure we reach on time and I was a little worked up about the dress code for the Vatican — but it seems people take it casually and you just need to tie a stole or something around bare shoulders for the Sistine Chapel. One thing though, Vatican is just too crowded and it was really hot on the outside at this time of the year — I would suggest winter time as a better time to visit Rome overall. Vatican is so full of the art treasures of the world, and it is so interesting to hear about how each Pope had a different approach to leaving their mark on the Vatican. Picture clicking were not allowed in Sistine Chapel but Michelangelo’s work is amazing with the imagination, the painting itself, the fact that this was done standing with utmost care using plaster art in 1508–12, simply awesome. And then St. Peter’s Basilica reminded of so many movies shot in this area both inside and the square outside — the shape of the church as a Cross, the holy Door, Michelangelo as an architect showing up strongly in the Dome and in his work Pieta (Mary with Jesus on her lap) were moving sites for me. The older walls, the air ducts, and the tombs underneath the basilica are a must see. Our guide Ana was great, energetic and interesting, in fact we paid extra to continue with her for the tour of the St. Peter’s Basilica. We had some really nice fresh pizza lunch sitting on a mat on the steps of the shop just outside Vatican and took a bus for Trastevere.
Trastevere is the areas south of the Vatican and means “beyond the Tiber” river. This is one of the most charming area of Rome with narrow medieval lanes, restaurants and just beautiful to walk around. Lot of picture perfect corners and buildings. We just strolled around the area and thoroughly enjoyed the leisurely time. We took a bus back to the hotel from across the river. But we were still not done — I read on the internet that night time Colosseum is beautiful so we took a bus to the ancient marvel of a building. It was nice, few pictures and sitting in the cool breeze for some time was good. This was a tough day for the kids because of all the walking in Vatican but they held well to my surprise, we did use stroller for the younger one.
Ancient Rome was the plan for the next day. We had breakfast at the hotel and reached Colosseum early at its opening time. The queues were already building up. One of the tips we had was to go the Forums first and buy the ticket there as it is the same ticket that is used for Colosseum. But we did not do it as I really wanted to get inside Colosseum early while it was not hot and spend time there — I will admit that I was mesmerized by this structure and that is why you can notice that I have already mentioned this building several times in this post. What we did was we took one audio / video guide for me, this was a separate line with almost zero waiting time to get in for this — this is probably the perfect way to beat the queue. I am a history enthusiast and to feel what it would have been inside this building 2000 years ago was breathtaking. In fact my wife and my elder daughter also enjoyed the structure as much as I did. For me, it was one of the high points of our trip and we did click a whole lot of pictures. From here, we went to the Forum’s where I used Rick Martin’s walking tour. It was really hot at this time and very tiring for the kids — so we rushed it a bit and focused only on some of the high point’s like the Arch of Constantine outside the forums, house of Vestal Virgins, Arch of Septimius Severus, place of Caesar’s murder. The view from the street of the Markets to Trajan was really nice. This part of Rome warranties a multi-day visit for a history student and perhaps in a cooler weather.
After lunch we walked to the Pantheon, another massive architectural marvel. From there onto the Piazza Navona. This is a beautiful square with lots of artists displaying their work, we bought some really nice paintings here and had one of the several rounds of gelato while in Italy. Rest a while in many of the beautiful squares, get water from the fountains, and walk the streets was the order of the day. We walked right up to Spanish mountains passing through the street with all the well-known big brand showrooms. We spent the evening at Villa Borghese park, a nice break from all the city walking for kids to have some fun. We rented a self-driven rickshaw type thing, rode a Segway for the first time, and dipped our feet in cool fountain water.
Next day started our road trip around Italy. We picked up our pre-booked car from Hertz on the train station. It took us almost 3 hours to pick up the car (frustrating), the GPS we took did not work, and consequently we got lost in Rome for couple of hours. Finally for rest of the trip the age old method of asking when lost and having printed directions is what we did to find our way around. We drove first to Sienna, and stayed in a beautiful chalet. The place we stayed in itself was a 2 floor room with a kitchenette, with olive garden setting and a small pool overlooking the hills. The COOP grocery store was nearby, so we went shopping there and that night cooked sumptuous rajma chawal with cherries to top it all. A nice glass of Chianti wine with the meal was a big plus. The town itself was a really beautiful little place with narrow walkways with incredible medieval buildings. The long combination escalator to go from the foot hills to the town was an experience in itself. The weather was a welcome cool one and we stayed till quite late in the town. The Piazza del Campo, site for annual horse racing event was impressive with lots of people just sitting and lying down in the square on its slating floors.
Our plan to drive through the Chianti area was another high point of the trip. We small winding roads, beautiful hills, occasional medieval time buildings atop the hills, farms around us were breathtaking. We stopped over in a village, Chianti village Castillina, which looked like right out of a movie set. We reached Pisa by the afternoon and here we stayed in a hotel right in the center of the town next to the leaning tower. So we got to spend our entire stay looking and walking around the famous monument. Overall, I thought Pisa was disappointing. The tower itself is not really impressive and the town itself is nothing to write home about. One could easily pass it without missing a bit of the Italy experience. We had decided to skip Florence this time because of kids. We saved it for our second Italy trip :-), maybe without the kids that time.
Drive to Venice was uneventful and efficient as i was quite use tod riving in Italy by now. Here there was another smart thing I learned from trip advisor write ups — we stayed in Mestre — better hotels, enough parking and literally 10 mins from Venice across the ocean bridge. I would say that is the smartest thing to do if you are driving and/ or are with kids and need more spacious room. Venice is romantic, enchanting and it did not feel like leaving the city even after just roaming around for 6–7 hours. The best things to do are to take the Grand Canal ride in vaporetto (water taxi) and then just get lost in the streets of Venice. The mask shops, the small bakeries, the gelato shops were all quite an experience. We had also happen to attend a fund raising music concert in one of the squares which was nice. The gondola ride is ridiculously expensive and a waste of time & money. The main tourist spot St. Mark’s square and Basilica are nice but very crowded until 5pm when the cruise ships leave. For the basilica, it is best to pre-book the entry time online. We were also told that the food here is bad and expensive, but we felt that if you do not want to get very fancy then it is not that bad. Overall, nothing compares to the unique experience of this city.
Onto to Switzerland. We were to spend 9 days in Switzerland and the plan was to start from Geneva with stays in Montreux, Interlaken and Lucerne; and fly out of Zurich. I did not get any good advice on how to get from Venice to Geneva / Montreux. The flights were expensive and not used normally, the direct train is no longer available and wastes a lot of time. I decided to drive the good 600 Kms and drop the car off at Geneva airport. I had lots of apprehensions about this long drive but it turned out to be a great decision. The Italy highway part was fast and then the drive through France, through Mt. Blanc area, was a beautiful drive. We dropped off the car at Geneva airport and took the train around Geneva Lake to Montreux. Before you start using the Swiss pass it needs to be validated at the station but after that it works like a charm. The SBB train system is great.
Montreux is a small city on the other side of Lake Geneva. The lake side walk, small sections for kids to play in the lake itself and view of the mountains is breathtaking. We had our taste of some decent middle eastern food also here. We slept early and next day morning on July 20th we had reservations for a whole day excursion on “Chocolate Train” from Golden Pass train system. I had done these booking on internet beforehand itself but the ticket seemed to be easily available. This tour had mixed reviews but we decided to do for kids, they can have fun as this included visits to a cheese factory and a chocolate factory. I would say that if you are spending enough time in Switzerland then it is not bad at all as one gets to experience internal Switzerland at leisure without too much planning. Kids were excited about the 2 factory visits with unlimited chocolate eating, and the village Gruyeres was postcard beautiful. One can smell the cows and the valley views were amazing. Evening we spent more time at the lake and got ready to leave early morning.
Montreux — Interlaken — Lucerne part is narrow gauge and serviced by golden pass trains. The Swiss pass works just fine, if you want you could do online reservations for extra money but we did not need it. Two tips — find out the time for the Panorama trains as they have the large glass windows for better views; and second not reserving is better as you can sit anywhere without looking for your reserved seats throughout the train. The train ride to Interlaken OST was beautiful and from there we took connecting 20 mins train to Lauterbrunnen. Here although the hotel was just a 3 mins walking distance, one thing we found out was that the shops closes down by 6ish, secondly we reached by 2 but our hotel reception was closed till 4 — now it may just be our hotel but this was indeed odd. Also, the hotel owner was a unco-operative guy and picked fights with lot of guests. Swiss hotels are expensive, with small rooms and limited service in general. We did find a restaurant next to our hotel though which served some great vegetarian food — homemade kind of burger, nice pizza and even had some Indian curry dishes. The information center was very very useful, answered all our questions, helped us plan our outings, gave us good weather information to decide where to go on which days.
Lauterbrunnen was like a “seven star hill station” in my wife’s words. Small village with one main street with all the hotels, view of the snowcapped Jungfrau ranges, waterfalls around the village were all beautiful site. It was a pleasantly cold here after the rather hot Italy weather. We hiked up one of the hills for a view from behind the waterfalls. It was raining for most of the evening and probably snowing up in the mountains. So we planned for Jungfrau the next day, as weather would be clearer and we might see some fresh snow. Now this one was another amazing experience — the train system itself is amazing going up such a height, the way the crowd is handled is efficient and the Jungfrau station set up is nicely organized. As expected there was nice fresh snow and kids had a blast playing in the snow — making snow man, and doing the tubing & sledging for more than 3 hours. We over packed our coats, it was not that cold — what is really needed is the right shoes, gloves, sunscreen of course sun glasses. The ice cave was nicely done too.
We spent 2 more days here in Lauterbrunnen and thoroughly enjoyed them with a great Alps experience. One day we took a cruise in Lake Thun, roamed around in Thun and Interlaken. Interlaken and in several places in Switzerland one can also do para gliding, we decided to skip it though. We were dying for Indian food and so this was the day we had a great meal at Taj Mahal restaurant in Interlaken. In Thun, we also discovered that McDonalds in Switzerland serves the Veggie burger similar to India — kids just loved that and that was our savior for kids over next few days in Switzerland. Second day we went to Mt. Murren and then to Grendelwald where we took the long cable car to First. Here the facilities for skiers in winters, and hikers in summers is great, we enjoyed some hiking, thoroughly soaked into the breath taking views of the valley and then kids had a great time in a play area at this high altitude. Another note on food — as our hotel did not serve breakfast — we used COOPS a lot. We bought nice bread, olives, dips, fruits & vegetables and made sandwiches which the kids loved. All of us were kind of getting bored of the regular breakfast items in restaurants so this was good change.
July 25th we reached Lucerne, which turned out to be a surprisingly large city. We stayed right at the edge of the “old city”. Walking around in this area was very enjoyable with lot of window and actual shopping. We visited the Natural History museum which was OK and the spent time around the canal which had beautiful flower arrangements on the 2 wooden bridges. It turned out that this was also the time for the annual “Blue Bells” music festival. The late evenings when the shops were closed the festival was at its full bloom with number of temporary street shops around the lake, live performances and just so many people having fun. There were very few kids as lot of smoking and drinking was going on. There were food stalls from every part of the world — people were just having a very good time. For our second day we took the train to Engelberg and went up the famous Mt Titlis. We wanted to make sure we did not miss it as this is part of the itinerary for all tours from India, though knowledgeable folks had told us that it would be same as Jungfrau. It was same — but only not as good. The glacier seems to be receding fast, the snow itself was not as pure and soft, the ice cave was a disappointment — but it did not stop the kids from having fun on the snow sledges and had couple of hours of good time. Engelberg on the foothills is a nice quite town and we spent some leisure time along the stream which seemed like a natural flow of water. On 27th, we took our direct train to Zurich airport and flew back to Hyderabad, completing a long awaited and incredibly enjoyable trip.
But before I finish I want to talk about a lot of interesting and delightful findings for us. No one told us about them, neither were they mentioned on the travel sites or books. For one, the ever running water fountains which had perfectly drinkable water was amazing. At first when we saw people filling their water bottles from the fountain at Spanish Steps in Rome we were surprised, and so we asked around and asked at our hotel, as well as the guide at the Vatican Museums to be doubly sure. After that we used it to the full — cool, clean water and free :-). Another very nice concept we saw especially in Switzerland was a COOP store outside of all the railway stations, easy to find and best place to get stuff for a quick snack or making your own sandwich or getting some nice fresh fruits to carry around for kids. Everyone must use them whenever they travel to this part of the world.
The way Swiss pass with a free family card worked for us was also beyond my expectations. Firstly the train network & punctuality in Switzerland is amazing and one needs to experience it to believe it. Lot of people told us about it but still i was positively surprised. Then the coverage on the pass with museums, buses, cruises, discounts on excursions — it was completely worth every penny.
I really should also mention the highways system between cities in Italy. It was again in some ways probably even better than what I saw in US. The “Autostrade” and the state highway network, Strade Statal, abbreviated SS, was great where one could drive at 130Km/h safely and without hassles. Trucks and slow moving vehicles stick to the right lane and if you do not then the guy wanting to overtake you would be touching you bumper at the back literally at that high speed :-), fairly effective system huh. What is more, never did I find a cop lurking around to catch you for smallest of violations. Italians are truly kings on the road :-).
And then the unique architectures. Italy had these medieval time cobble streets with vertical 3 or 4 floor or so buildings right next to each other in almost every city. The doors to these buildings would be massive wooden ones with big bolts and operated using electronic systems. We kept peeping into them and guessed about the insides of these buildings until finally we stayed in one such building in Pisa — our hotel was really an apartment in a building like this. Switzerland on the other had had these beautiful 2 floor buildings with hut shape tops. The Windows almost always had a false door of wood on the outside (or so it seemed), with a simple grill and flower arrangements on the ledge. It looked really pretty.
Now for the things that did not go so well. Firstly, the rental car process, things are really not as smooth or transparent as one would find in the US. It was not clear that if I picked up the car in Rome and dropped in Geneva, there would be about Euro 370 extra charges — that is quite a bit of money and I found out only after the charges showed up on my credit card. And then this was my first time driving in Europe and I was relying on my GPS to work, it just did not and it seems it is a routine issue as no one at the rental car company was surprised when I reported that. Also, they could not fix the problem when i visited the agency again. Then there was the issue of drive from Venice to Geneva I had to cross country borders twice, to pass through France, and that meant I had to pay the Euro 40 charges twice. It really should have something like a one day validity.
We are all vegetarians and were told horror stories of lack of food options for us. But we do love Italian food, Pizza and Pasta, so I was fairly confident that we would be fine. We carried some Indian spiced up snacks so we could take care of once in a while cravings and also carried few boxes of Cup-O-Noodles for kids just in case they did not get adjusted to the food types. But things worked out fine. There were enough vegetarian options on the typical roadside European restaurants and also Gelato was a of course a big hit. Towards the end of the trip we did start missing the Indian spices so we looked up Taj Mahal Restaurant in Interlaken as I already mentioned, and it was great. And once again doing groceries in COOP and then making our own Sandwiches was an option we used more than once, and loved it.
I would say a truly memorable vacation. Europe is beautiful, clean and very touristy as well as provides options to find your own style of spending your precious vacation time.

I hope this update finds you well.
I’ve been back from Italy for about six weeks and am still in the process of digesting all my learning from my trip. It was a fantastic experience, and I’m glad to have had my first international experience.
I will continue to update this article with photos from different days of the trip as time goes on. Nevertheless, I wanted to publish this partially completed version so as to ensure it doesn’t end up in my drafts, never to be shared with the world.
Enjoy this post,
Josh

THE TRAVEL PLANS
The plan was to visit Italy for just over three weeks, with a few days at Rome prior to joining a Tour of Italy for two weeks, with a return to Rome for an extra six or so days at the end of the tour.
We completed the Italy’s best tour with Cosmos. The tour in our trip saw us complete the following:

Places visited:
**********
TAKING A TRAVEL JOURNAL
I decided to take a travel journal to reflect both on my learning, and also to collect receipts, business cards, postcards, holy cards and other trinkets as I toured the country. All in all, I ended up with so much stuff I had to pack all the material collected separately, but there was a lot of value in journalling.
The travel journal I used was made by Typo and can be purchased here:
http://cottonon.com/US/p/typo/the-wanderer-travel-journal/2013463501982.html#start=1
Whilst I didn’t use all of the sections on this tour, I did make use of the following sections:
What follows is my notes from the notes, daily adventures, things I learnt along the way, and second notes sections. I have interspersed photos, post-travel commentary and other relevant pieces of information to make these more useful for future reference.

NOTES:

29/06/16
We’re leaving tomorrow morning. I’m starting to pack and get things ready now, following my usual, last minute routine.
I’m looking forward to heading off, and am glad to finally be on holidays from work.
Requests to complete for people while I’m away:
Post-travel note: I made a video for each of these requests on my iPhone and sent them to the people concerned before I returned home.

01/07/16
My first ever view of an international country (Hong Kong) from a plane.
We’ve survived our trip from Australia to Hong Kong. Shortly we will be boarding our second flight, which will take us to Rome.
I’ve followed Courtney’s advice and kept awake thus far. If I can push myself a few hours more and then sleep on the plane I should be close to achieving Rome’s time with my body clock.
I purchased a 500 ml Coke whilst here, which cost 28 Hong Kong dollars. There was a girl here who unrolled her yoga mat and proceeded to do a lot of poses… I was amazed by her flexibility. I have contacted Vanessa.
Whilst on the plane I watched:
I had chicken and rice and nearly choked on an asparagus-like vegetable. I also had pork noodles, which were nice.
Praise God for this wonderful opportunity.
******
01/07/16
I’m on the plane and we are a few hours from landing in Rome. Sleep has been nearly impossible on this plane, so I’m going to be suffering from jet lag when we arrive.
So far the food on this flight hasn’t been as good as the prior one. Nevertheless, things are more exciting now.
I watched the movie for ‘the Entourage’ on this flight, read some more of ‘The Imitation of Christ’, completed this journal entry and tried to sleep, albeit unsuccessfully.
At Rome:
We went to our accommodation and checked in our bags, as we can’t access our room until 2:00pm. From there, we checked out the Pantheon, the St. Ignatius Church (photos of the roof below), some other churches and Trevi Fountain.
We had lunch @ Vacanza Romana. First impression of Italian Pizzas is that D.O.C. in Australia is very authentic.
Also, my rosary broke but I seem to have been able to fix it.
We went for a walk again later in the day. Whilst doing this, we stumbled upon a Mass, where I went up for a blessing from the priest. Prior to that, we had Galati from a place at Trevi Fountain, which was amazing.
We also checked out some Roman ruins at the end of our hotel’s street earlier in the day.

DAILY ADVENTURES
The weather was: Sunny
Day / date: 01/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Land, check-in, get food and rest, and see some sites.
My daily adventures: See earlier notes for info on today.
We also picked up some water from a Marian fountain; I’ve consumed most of it though.
I’m also impressed with the number of drinking fountains in Rome that are free to use, and the quality of the water that comes from these. Apparently there are 1300+ in Rome, which is really impressive.
My desire to learn Latin has substantially increased.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 02/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Revisit some Churches, visit the Colosseum, Colosseum night tour, and take photos, Trastavere, look for gifts.
My daily adventures: We went to the Roman Forum, which was spectacular! We stumbled upon an ancient Marian Church that is on display there until September. We got a lot of photos, so that was exceptionally well timed.
The Colosseum was fascinating, and it was incredible to tick it off the bucket list. The night tour of it was even more exceptional. Pizza from the corner shop was okay but not the best. Really cheap though. At the Colosseum, we met an Australian woman who said she thought that the Italians lived in a museum. I thought she was pretty accurate with that comment.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 03/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia and Vatican City
Plans for the Day: Attend Mass, visit the Vatican, Check out of hotel, join and commence our two-week tour.
My daily adventures: Went to Vatican, St Peter’s Square. Bought 300 Euro odd-dollars’ worth of Rosaries, etc. which we had blessed in the Papal blessing. Moved to the new hotel. It has a bigger room but has a less comfortable bed. We met our Tour Director (Lambros in Gk. or Alex in Italian) then Mum and I went and had chips and lasagne (which was beautiful) at a local Italian restaurant that her and Courtney had eaten at year’s prior.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 04/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Sistine Chapel, St Peter’s Basilica, Roman Forum, Colosseum, Dinner.
My daily adventures: This was our first day with the tour.
Sistine Chapel — amazing! We will definitely need to revisit this & St. Peter’s basilica to spend more time taking it in. The tour guide was great, but I felt we didn’t get as much time in the Colosseum and Forum as was necessary. I was very grateful we had visited them previously. Dinner was good, consisting of bruschetta, pasta with peas, lasagne, chicken and potatoes, then gelato and coffee.
I’m not sure how these places are able to make a profit, so I assume it is through bulk cooking that they are able to do so. Dinner was accompanied by a flute player and a guitarist, which was nice.
P.s. Today we also met our bus drive Pino.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / day: Tuesday 05/07/16
Destination: Roma, Pisa, Montecatini — Italia
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
On our way from Rome I felt really sick from the bus motion. Consequently I loaded up on my travel tables. As of lunchtime (now), I’m in a medically induced tiredness. We then went to Pisa and saw the leaning tower. Lunch was pizza and biscotti from some street shops. We opted to check out the Cathedral, Baptistery and the cemetery rather than climb the tower. I tried European Maccas there. We had dinner @ Montecatini at a local winery / olive oil farm. The food and wine were delicious and we had great company.
******
The weather was: Sunny with clouds
Day / date: 06/07/2016 — Wednesday
Destination: Florence, Italia
Plans for the day: visit Florence
My daily adventures:
We went to Florence today and got to do a tour with a local guide. From there we went to a local market sitting on a bridge. There is lots of jewellery and leather in Florence, but it is expensive. The highlight of the day for me was paying 15 Euro to go to the Cathedral, baptistery and Museum. We saw some relics, etc. Back at Montecatini, we went to the Funicular and then had dinner at the hotel. I then had a few drinks at the bar.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 07/07/16
Destination: La spezia, cinque terre, Levanto, Genoa, Italia
Plans for the day: Have pesto, check out local village markets, possibly visit the beach, go somewhere nice for dinner
My daily adventures: Today we went to la spezia to catch a train to the cinque terre. Whilst there we visited Vernazza and Monterosso. At Vernazza I looked at the Church, went up to the tower and walked around. At Monterosso we walked around the old section, had pesto @ Ristorante ‘Da Ely” and I ought a beach towel for 10 Euro. We then caught a train to Levanto, where our bus took us to our accommodation in Genoa, a nice, four star hotel. We then went to dinner at a place recommended by our tour Director Lambros, but I didn’t think it was that great.
******
The weather was: Sunny with clouds, cloudy
Day / date: 08/07/2016
Destination: Genoa, Milan, Lake Maggiore, Italia
Plans for the day: as above, with tour dinner
My daily adventures: We had a tour of Genoa with a local guide. They were very knowledgeable, but I didn’t find Genoa as impressive as some of the other locations we have visited. From there, we drove to Milan. I checked out the Cathedral, had Maccas for lunch, bought some Galati and visited the local shops. We then went to Lake Maggiore. We’re staying in a nice hotel here, although we had to get the bed adjusted from a double to a twin share. We had dinner on a nearby island as part of the tour, sitting with two Australia couples.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 09/07/2016
Destination: Lugano, Switzerland
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: We took the bus from Lake Maggiore to Lugano, crossing the boarder into Switzerland. From there, we went to Monte Tamaro, where we had some lunch and got to see an amazing view. To do this, we had to catch a chair lift up and back. After this, we came back to the hotel.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 10/11/2016
Destination: Verona and Venice, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: we left our hotel and went to Verona, where we had a tour of the place and got to touch the boob of the statue of Juliet. We had lunch there and I had really nice pasta. From there, we drove to our hotel near Venice. At night, we went to dinner in Venice and had a quick look around. The food wasn’t too great (in my humble opinion) but Venice was beautiful.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 11/07/2016
Destination: Venice, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
We went to Venice via boat again. After finding some people in our group that got separated from the group, we did a gondola ride, which was stunning. After that, we went and got a replacement earring for Julie, before getting lunch. I had pasta and a 500ml bottle of Chianti to myself, which left me a little drunk for the afternoon. We didn’t get to see inside St. Mark’s Basilica, but we were able to see other churches, including S. Giovanni Basilica. We had some ice cream, looked at shops, went back to the hotel and had dinner with some Spanish and NZ friends.
******
The weather was: Sunny (Assisi) Cloudy (Ravenna)
Day / date: 12/07/2016
Destination: Ravenna and Assisi (Dante’s tomb is in Ravenna)
Plans for the day: Drop off Mirtza’s prayer in Assisi. Visit the Basilica.
My daily adventures: On the way to Ravenna we saw the longest river in Italy (650 km) and the church where the musical scale was invented. At Ravenna, we visited the Arian baptistery and the Church of St. Francis, along with Dante’s sepulchre. On the way to Assisi, we stopped for lunch and had a lasagne. At Assisi, we visited the Basilica, which was amazing! Three churches on top of one another! We bought some things at the gift shop and then headed over to our hotel in Perugia for the evening, where we had dinner.
“This is a beautiful country.” (My reflection in the margin at 3:15pm on bus in rural area on the way to Assisi)
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 13/07/2016 — Wednesday
Destination: Pompeii
Plans for the day: visit Pompeii, survive the long bus ride.
My daily adventures: We left our hotel early this morning to drive to Pompeii, then Sorrento. On the way we watched a movie, ‘My life in ruins’ (a comedy allegedly w/ Tom Hanks as the producer about tours). When we got to Pompeii, I had some Pasta, bought some post cards and a booklet on the place. We then took a tour of part of Pompeii, which is so impressive! We arrived at Sorrento about 5:00pm.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 14/07/2016
Destination: Capri, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: We went on a ferry to Capri. Unfortunately, I was sick on the way over and on the bus after. This caused me to miss the chair lift. Afterwards, we went to a Museum and had lunch, followed by a walk to some scenic spots and a ride on the funicular. We headed back to the hotel for a nice buffet and went for a walk with some friends through Sorrento, stopping at a wine bar for a drink.
******
The weather was: raining
Day/date: 15/07/2016
Destination: Positano, then Rome
Plans for the day: Visit Positano, get to Rome, wash clothes for tomorrow.
My daily adventures: We caught a bus to Positano, where it was raining. This is the only day so far that it has been raining whilst we have been on tour. We checked out Santa Maria Assunta Esan Vito whilst there. From there, we made our way back to Rome, only stopping briefly at two places to get some food and to have a toilet stop, because traffic jams caused us some delays. The dinner was a bit disappointing, but the company was nice with a brief tour on the bus following at night, along with a stop over at Trevi Fountain.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 16/07/2016
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Move hotels, make our plans for the rest of the week, get a nice lunch / dinner, go site seeing.
My daily adventures: We had breakfast with our kiwi friends prior to moving to our old hotel. 140 Euro a night to sleep on a couch, as Mum had the bed. Anyway, we went and checked out the temples of portuna and Hercules, the mouth of truth and related basilica, another church and basilica, picked up some holy water, crucifix and prayer card, ate pizza and Maccas, washed clothes. I bought a guide to the pantheon (which we revisited) and read it, and also bought a bottle of cheap Chianti for consumption prior to the trip home.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 17/07/2016
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Mass @ Pantheon, visit catacombs
My daily adventures: Today we went to Mass @ the Pantheon. This was cool, as they turned on all the lights and cleared the tourists out for it. There were only 18 or so people 5 minutes beforehand, but it ended up with about 100 or so. From there, we met up with Anita & Ryan after lunch and walked to the catacombs. These were so impressive, and definitely worth the 8 Euro to get in. After this, we bought some pizza and had it on our hotel’s rooftop.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 18/07/2016
Destination:
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
We had a much needed and well-deserved sleep in and low start to the day. We then walked to Trastavere, and had a look around (although there was not much to see). Afterward, we walked to Castel Sant Angelo, and paid to walk around inside. It was quire impressive, but left me pondering why Pope Paul III had a room decorated about the pagan god Apollo. After relaxing, we went hunting for an ATM that worked and then had a nice dinner a few blocks behind the Pantheon.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 19/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Shopping for gifts for family, friends and myself
My daily adventures: We spent most of today looking around to buy bits and pieces for family and friends, then we found a really nice place for dinner.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 20/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Visit Michelangelo’s Moses
My daily adventures: I went to Santa Maria Maggiore, Santo Pietro in Vincoli, St John Lateran and the Santa Scala. We had lunch near the Colosseum, which is probably the worst lunch I’ve had during my time here. Consequently, we had sinner @ the same place as the night before. I started coming down sick today.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day/date: 21/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: Today I was unwell. Consequently, our original plans to visit St Paulo outside the walls did not occur. We’ve had a pretty laid back day today. I have purchased a backpack to take my trinkets and gifts for people home in.

Revisiting Romans 9
One of the religious topics I have most disputed in the last few years is, ‘Does God love all men?’ Historically, I have said no on the basis of Romans chapter 9.
After hearing a sermon on 1 Timothy 2:4 (God desires all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth), I knew I could not accept an understanding that requires two wills in God or the verse to be interpreted to mean, ‘all elect men’, not ‘all men’.
The only section for which I had not been able to come to a reasonable conclusion about was this section in Romans 9, particularly:
Material consulted during the process included:
I understood the Calvinist position well, but was unable to understand the Catholic position on this scripture. They are not quite Calvinistic, Lutheran or Arminian. Nevertheless, a sermon by Adrian Rogers (not Catholic) helped me along with various writings of Thomas Aquinas (summa theologica and his notes on Romans) to finally see how people with other paradigms hold their position.
This position seems to me to make better sense of the particular text, of the scriptures as a whole, and of the Catholic position. Consequently, this post constitutes a retraction of my former position (unless it can be sufficiently demonstrated otherwise that this position is wrong).
The sermon by Adrian Rogers was as follows:

This morning, I stopped by a coffee bar near my house. I’ve become friends with the barista, Stefano. As Stefano prepared my macchiato lungo, he said he had some sad news. His father, who had been ill for some time, had died. The funeral was canceled because of the restrictions imposed on the region.
Stefano placed my coffee on the counter. Normally, in an Italian coffee shop, you stand at the bar and drink the tiny cup of espresso. I took a few sips as we continued talking. A guy with his phone to his ear, apparently a co-worker, stepped over and rapped sharply on the bar. I’d violated a rule. All customers, per the decree, are to sit at tables. This is part of the mandate that people are to maintain a one-meter distance from each other. Stefano said that if a policeman drove by and saw me drinking coffee at the counter, he could be fined several thousand euros. He also reported that city officials had been driving past with bullhorns, urging everybody to stay inside.
Yesterday, at the local supermarket, a man in a uniform…directed everyone to get a large…

When you live abroad Italy is that country that everyone knows. Everyone loves. Everyone has a story about. A son that got married there. A friend that had an amazing time in a city you never heard of.
Italy is the country that lights up people’s face. When they hear you are Italian, a smile appears on their face: “Ah, I-ta-li-anooo”, it’s the most common reaction. And then they start with their stories. Of all shape and type, but with always one thing in common: love. It seems like everyone abroad loves Italy. They love our food, our people, our sea, our mountains, our countryside, our cities, our clothes, our style, our hospitality, our culture, our football teams, our cars and motors, our actors and singers. And the list could go on and on.
In more than 3 years leaving abroad I cannot count how much love, stories and nice words I have heard about our country. I heard people saying: “Believe me, I’ve travelled most of the World by now: Italy is Italy, there’s nothing as unique and beautiful.”
Love doesn’t have an explanation, it’s love that explains things
Let’s start from here. From our culture, from our beauty and our history.
We are incredibly lucky, we just don’t see it — we are too close.

Italy is a country that exudes charm, history, and culinary delights. From the romantic canals of Venice to the ancient ruins of Rome and the artistic wonders of Florence, it captivates millions of tourists each year. However, traveling to Italy raises several questions among first-time visitors and seasoned explorers alike. This article explores five frequently asked questions about Italy, providing insights and information valuable for anyone planning a trip to this magnificent country.
The best time to visit Italy varies depending on your travel preferences, but generally, spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) are considered ideal.

Italian cuisine is celebrated worldwide, but nothing compares to tasting the authentic dishes in their region of origin. Here are some must-try foods:
Navigating Italy can be a straightforward experience if you know your options:
Understanding Italian customs can enhance your experience and help you connect with locals:
While knowing basic Italian phrases can enhance your travel experience, it is not necessary to be fluent. Many Italians, particularly in popular tourist areas, speak English. That said, learning a few key phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture and breaking the ice with locals. Here are some useful expressions:
A1: The currency used in Italy is the Euro (€). Credit cards are widely accepted, but it’s advisable to carry some cash for smaller shops or markets.
A2: Yes, Italy is generally a safe country for tourists. However, as in any popular destination, remain aware of your surroundings and take precautions against pickpockets, especially in crowded areas.
A3: Dress according to the weather and occasion. Italians have a strong sense of style, so dressing well is appreciated. Comfortable yet chic clothing is recommended for sightseeing.
A4: Italy has a good healthcare system, but it’s advisable to have travel insurance. Also, check your vaccination status and ensure you carry any necessary medications.
A5: The legal drinking age in Italy is 18 years. However, parents can allow their children to drink alcohol under supervision.
In conclusion, Italy is a delightful destination filled with rich history, fantastic cuisine, and warm hospitality. Familiarizing yourself with these frequently asked questions can help you make the most of your visit, ensuring an unforgettable experience in this remarkable country. Buon viaggio! (Safe travels!)

Italy — what a unique country! The landscapes, the food, and, more than anything else, a whole unique set of unspoken rules that no one ever bothers to explain. But don’t worry, there’s no need to panic!
In this article, I’ll give you five little secrets that I picked up from my time living in Rome. Try to embrace them, and you’ll navigate the Italian way of life without offending an entire nation. So enjoy, soak it in, and before you know it, you’ll live La Dolce Vita like a true local!
Italians don’t drink cappuccino after 11 am. They cringe at every tourist who dares to eat pizza with pineapple on top. Eating fish pasta with Parmigiano is considered a direct attack on every Italian and putting an ice cube into a wine glass is the fastest way to get arrested.
Ever heard of these things? Influencers have taken over the world and so have their over-exaggerated stereotypes of the Italians.
Italians are some of the friendliest and chill people in the world. They won’t make you slurp a carton of milk if you order a ‘Latte’ instead of a ‘Latte Macchiato’ on accident. They won’t take out some sort…

Italy, a land of stunning landscapes, rich history, and unparalleled culture, has captivated the hearts of travelers and scholars for centuries. From its ancient ruins to world-renowned cuisine, Italy boasts an array of symbols and traditions that have left an indelible mark on the world. In this article, we will explore the top three things for which Italy is most renowned: its art and architecture, its cuisine, and its fashion.
Italy has been at the forefront of artistic innovation for centuries, playing a pivotal role in the development of Western art. The country is home to some of the most significant and influential artists in history, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Caravaggio. Their masterpieces, which adorn galleries, churches, and public spaces across Italy, continue to inspire generations.
When it comes to architecture, Italy has some of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. The Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Colosseum in Rome, and St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City are just a few examples. Each of these structures tells a story, not only of architectural prowess but also of the cultural and historical significance of their times.
The Renaissance, which began in Italy during the 14th century, marked a significant turning point in the realm of art and architecture. This period saw the rebirth of classical ideals, leading to the creation of breathtaking works that continue to draw art lovers from all corners of the globe. Florence, often regarded as the cradle of the Renaissance, is particularly famous for its contributions to art and culture, with its Uffizi Gallery housing masterpieces that tell the story of human expression.
Italian cuisine is world-famous, celebrated for its fresh ingredients, bold flavors, and regional diversity. The country’s culinary history tells a story of simplicity and tradition. Every dish carries a deep connection to the land and the people, making Italian food as much about love and family as it is about sustenance.
Some of the hallmark dishes of Italian cuisine include pasta, pizza, and risotto. Each region has its own variations and specialties. For instance, in Naples, the classic Margherita pizza showcases a simple yet delightful combination of tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. In contrast, pasta dishes like Tagliatelle al Ragù resonate deeply within households and are often made from scratch.
One of the key aspects of Italian cooking is the emphasis on fresh, high-quality ingredients. The Mediterranean climate allows for the cultivation of exceptional produce, such as ripe tomatoes, fragrant basil, and rich olive oil. Italian cuisine encourages the use of seasonal ingredients, resulting in dishes that not only taste exceptional but also reflect the cycle of nature.
Italy is often regarded as the fashion capital of the world, with cities like Milan and Florence leading the charge in haute couture and luxury design. Italian fashion has a distinctive style that embraces sophistication, innovation, and craftsmanship. Renowned designers like Gucci, Prada, and Versace have made their mark not only on the runways of Milan but also in the hearts of fashion enthusiasts globally.
Milan Fashion Week is one of the most prestigious events in the fashion calendar, where designers unveil their latest collections to the world. This event showcases a mix of established fashion houses and emerging designers, illustrating the dynamic nature of Italian fashion. The impact of Italian style permeates beyond clothing; it influences accessories, jewelry, and even the world of home design.
What sets Italian fashion apart is its commitment to craftsmanship and attention to detail. Many Italian brands uphold a tradition of artisanal techniques, ensuring that each piece embodies quality and elegance. The “Made in Italy” label is synonymous with luxury and is a mark of pride for designers and craftsmen alike.
Italy is rich in artistic heritage across various regions. Key areas include:
Italian cuisine varies significantly by region due to geographical factors, climate, and local produce. For instance, Northern Italy features creamy risottos, while Southern Italy is known for its robust tomato-based dishes. Each region’s traditions and ingredients uniquely shape its culinary offerings.
Italian fashion is influenced by historical and cultural factors, including art, architecture, and societal changes. The elegance of Renaissance art often influences contemporary designs, while modern-day Milan serves as a hub for global fashion trends, blending tradition with innovation.
To truly immerse yourself in Italian culture, consider:
The “Made in Italy” label signifies quality, luxury, and craftsmanship. It represents products made in Italy, often using traditional methods and high-grade materials, thereby reflecting Italy’s dedication to excellence in design and production.
Italy, with its enchanting art, delectable cuisine, and impeccable fashion sense, stands as a beacon of culture and heritage for the world. Each of these three aspects intertwines with the identity of the Italian people and showcases their contributions to art, food, and style. Whether you’re an avid art enthusiast, a food lover, or a fashion aficionado, Italy offers a rich tapestry of experiences that celebrate what it means to be Italian.

I am a Finnish software developer who recently moved to Italy. This is the third episode in a series of posts where I write about my experiences in living in my new home country.
The observations are written by someone who has lived most of his life in the Northern Europe: first around 30 years in Finland and then some years in the Netherlands.
This post is not strictly part of the same canon as the previous ones as I wasn’t yet living in Italy at the time the events took place. But the story is still worth telling because it revolves around the same topic as the previous episode: bureaucracy, oh yes!
Around August 2021 me and my girlfriend were looking for an apartment to buy in Sardinia. We went to see a couple of places and found an interesting one. In October, after a careful calculation of our financial status, we decided to make an offer for the apartment. To our surprise the offer was accepted! I started dreaming about sitting on my own patio staring into the sunset while enjoying an ice-cold Ichnusa non filtrata.
I had heard horror stories on how the bureaucracy in Italy can be extremely slow. My pessimistic expectation was that drinking Ichnusa on the patio would have to wait around early spring 2022. Magari!
I wanted to make sure that I have everything ready when the time comes to sign the papers and make the notary act. I applied for a codice fiscale in the Embassy of Italy in the Hague. I contacted my bank in Finland to apply for a mortgage, and I even had the purchase proposal translated into English for them. I made all the necessary arrangements to have all my finances available with a few clicks of a button. My bank told me that after signing the documents for the mortgage, it could take even up to a week for the funds to be available. I assured them that one week is nothing when dealing with Italian bureaucracy.
At the same time, my girlfriend was also applying for a mortgage in an Italian bank. One of the requirements for the mortgage was that there should be a technical inspection done on the apartment. Sounds reasonable. The real estate agent told us that since the building is relatively new, from the early 2000s, and the apartment is quite small, the technical inspection is just a formality, and that there shouldn’t be any issues with it.
The inspection was done around December, and we were anxiously waiting for the statement to be released. Around middle of February we received a message from the agent that all lights are green, and that everything is ready for signing the purchase agreement. I withdrew the mortgage and liquidated my other assets. I was proud of myself for being fully prepared and having everything ready. Finnish efficiency at its best — I’m not going to be the bottleneck. We agreed that we would sign the purchase agreement March 1st. I could almost taste the Ichnusa.
Things started getting delayed by a few weeks but I wasn’t worried. I guess minor delays were expected and nothing out of the ordinary. But then we heard that there is an issue that was noticed in the technical inspection. This is the first time I heard the horrifying word: sanatoria. Sanatoria in itself is not a bad thing, it’s actually good. But the problem is when the sanatoria has not been done, in other words the sanatoria is unresolved. In the context of real estate, this means that someone has improvised and built something funky without proper permissions and violated the building regulations. In Finland this means building an illegal sauna too close to the shore. Legally, you cannot sell an apartment that has an unresolved sanatoria. (Though, this being Italy, of course there’s always a way.)
The technical inspection declared that there was a mismatch between the official documents and the reality. According to the documents there should be a small balcony in the bedroom. In fact, there was no balcony but there is a window. This was a surprise both to us and the owner of the apartment. But doesn’t sound like too big of a problem, right? One might think that it would be a bigger issue if there was a balcony that shouldn’t be there. And yes, that’s true. It didn’t seem like a big problem. But while the balcony didn’t exist, whoever genius who built the apartment had decided to make the bedroom slightly larger than it was supposed to be. And that’s not good.
What is the solution? You need to find a way to make the documents and the reality aligned. So you have to either grab a hammer and start building a balcony, or you need to amend the documents. I don’t know how to build a balcony and I would expect that adjusting the paperwork is easier so that’s what we decided to do. Practically, this means that you need to have a good connection with the municipality officials and you need to hire a local geometra to come make measurements, and draw new blueprints, etc. Obviously, depending on the size of the sanatoria, all of this costs money, but time is the bigger problem. The owner would pay for the sanatoria but it can take a long time to get it resolved, even years.
Apparently, in Sardinia this is a common problem. There are many houses that have an unresolved sanatoria which effectively means that you cannot sell or buy them. Our agent came up with a marvellous (though not a unique) idea: Rather than signing the purchase agreement at this moment, we could make a private agreement with the owner stating that we pay some lump of money right now in advance, then we would wait for the sanatoria to be resolved, I could already go drink Ichnusa on the patio, and after that we would finalise the deal and sign the purchase agreement. Sounds amazing, right? Wrong. If you’ve read my previous posts, you already know that I’m not a big fan of this kind of unorthodox arrangements. We kindly rejected the idea.
The agent assured us that the sanatoria should be definitely resolved by the end of May. Time passed, our offer expired, we renewed the offer, winter turned to spring, Ichnusa got warm, and spring turned to summer. The offer expired again in June and we renewed it for one final time. It expired again in July and we decided not to renew it anymore. We hadn’t heard anything from the agent for a long time. I still had all the earmarked money lying in my bank account. I was sad and disappointed.
In July I went for a trip to Scotland with my friends. We booked a rental car and drove around while sipping whisky: Edinburgh, Inverness, Isle of Skye, Fort William, Oban, Glasgow, and back to Edinburgh. I highly recommend Scotland as a travel destination. I learned that Speyside whisky is not my favourite but I do like Highland whisky. And it was confirmed that I especially enjoy the smoky ones from Islay. Also, after having tasted a whisky it’s nice to compare your experience with maestro Lüning, Horst Lüning, and see what is his interpretation of it. I challenge you to come up with as many adjectives to describe the whisky as Horst does.
Anyway, by the end of our heavily peated trip in Scotland I received a message from my girlfriend that suddenly things are moving fast with the apartment. By some miracle the sanatoria had been resolved and that, if we are still interested, the owner is willing to sell the apartment for the same price as we initially offered. We had to act fast, because the mortgage proposal provided by the Italian bank for my girlfriend was expiring in September, and at this moment we were almost in August. August in Italy is the peak holiday season so finding a notary to notarise the purchase agreement could be extremely difficult, but luckily the agent already had one available.
Finally, grazie a Dio, in the beginning of August we bought the apartment. It only took around 10 months after we made the initial offer. The purchase happened at the same time as we were about to move from the Netherlands to Italy, which felt a bit overwhelming in the beginning. However, the combination of living in the mainland Italy, in Frascati, and having a beach house in Sardinia has turned out to be a fantastic concept. And Ichnusa does taste pretty damn good when you enjoy it on your own patio.
Random observations about the whole process:

I recently came back from a three month working culinary tour of Italy where I fell truly, madly, deeply, in love with pasta. I am a young cook from Massachusetts and embarked on the journey to awaken my senses to the culinary center of the universe that is Italy (apologies to the French). After spending about a month in Florence, eating anything and everything I could get my hands on, I decided to spend the second month volunteering on a farm in the rural city of Città di Castello, about an hour and a half east of Florence. For one month I planted seeds, milked goats, mowed grass, and for the turning point…made pasta. I had made homemade pasta a handful of times before; my dad always made it around Christmas time and I had taken a class about it earlier in the trip. But for some reason, learning it here was completely different. I was taken to another planet when I was making pasta on the farm — it was a transcendental experience for me, if you will. I fell in love with the art of it and knew that I had to continue when I arrived back to the states.
Handcrafted pasta had taken hold of me and wasn’t letting go anytime soon. Here I am, a few months later, back in the states and it’s grip is stronger than ever — I recently opened an Italian inspired handcrafted pasta business, Allora Pasta Co. I use the recipe that I learned from the woman in Italy and take the same time, care, and love as I did then. I focus on carefully sourced ingredients — working with local farmers as much as possible to ensure a delicious, quality product you can feel good about eating and sharing with your loved ones.
While I can’t share my secret pasta recipe with you, I will share a few of my favorite sauces to go along with your pasta of choice. Whip up one of these bad boys, grab yourself a bag (or 5) of Allora, a bottle of Prosecco and you’ll be transported to a little caffe set upon cobble stone streets and beautiful churches in the center of Rome. To learn more about Allora Pasta Co. and my Italian adventures, visit www.allorapasta.com.
Aglio e olio (Garlic and Oil)
Italy’s most beloved sauce and a staple of Italian cooking, aglio e olio is simple to make but offers a complex flavor that will have any guest impressed by your skills.
6 tbsp and 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves of garlic, sliced thin
1/2 cup pasta water, mmm starchy = creamy
Red pepper flakes (if you like a little kick!)
Salt and pepper to taste
Make this recipe after the pasta has already been cooked and reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water. Add the garlic and 6 tablespoons of oil to a large, hot (this is important) pan. Add red pepper flakes for that little kick. Cook over medium heat until garlic is light brown. Transfer your fully cooked pasta and the pasta water to the pan, rev up that heat, and cook — continually stirring and tossing until a creamy sauce forms and coats all of the pasta. Remove from heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, stir well to combine.
Basil Almond Pesto
Deriving from Genoa, Italy, Pesto has been around for centuries. While this isn’t the exact ‘Italian recipe’ it is an adapted version I think you will find delectable to your taste buds.
2 cups packed fresh basil leaves
2 cloves of garlic
1/4 cup slivered almonds
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Combine basil, garlic, and almond in food processor and pulse until all is coarsely chopped. Slowly add the oil and process until fully incorporated and smooth. Transfer the mixture into a large mixing bowl and stir in the cheese. Salt and pepper until perfection!
Tuscan Ragú
Ah, ‘meat sauce.’ The perfect addition to any pasta dish. Turning a light snack into a hearty, wholly satisfying meal. Add the ingredients to a crock pot and simmer for a few hours to invite an even more complex flavor over for dinner.
1 cup stock of choice (veggie, chicken, or beef)
14oz ground beef
3.5oz ground pork, such as ground sausage
2 medium white onions
3 peeled tomatoes
1 celery stick
1 carrot
2 glasses of red wine, 1 to sip and 1 for the sauce 😉
1 cup of milk
Salt and pepper to taste
Add a drizzle of oil to a medium sized pot and brown the vegetables on a medium-high flame, add 1/2 cup of the stock to keep from burning. Season with salt and pepper. Once browned, add the meat and continue to brown. Add the wine (1 cup) and let it reduce and eventually evaporate. Stir in tomatoes and milk. Add more broth if necessary to avoid sticking. Cook on low flame for an hour or so — until all the meat is cooked through and the flavors have come together. Salt and pepper to taste.
All recipes have been adapted from ones I had learned during my time in Italy.

Italy, a country renowned for its rich history, breathtaking landscapes, and delectable cuisine, carries with it several nicknames that reflect its unique identity. These monikers capture the essence of the nation and the various aspects that make it special. In this article, we will explore Italy’s most popular nicknames, their meanings, and what they signify about this beautiful country.
One of Italy’s most famous nicknames is “Bel Paese,” which translates to “Beautiful Country” in English. This nickname encapsulates Italy’s extraordinary natural beauty, encompassing everything from its picturesque countryside, rolling hills, and stunning coastal regions to its historic cities filled with architectural marvels.
The name “Bel Paese” is frequently used in art and literature to describe the aesthetic beauty of Italy. It represents Italy’s legacy of art and culture, where countless artists, musicians, and writers have drawn inspiration. From the scenic landscapes of Tuscany to the grandeur of Venice, it is no surprise that Italy is celebrated for its beauty.
Italy is often colloquially referred to as the “Boot” due to its distinctive shape resembling a high-heeled boot on the map. This playful nickname is used mainly in informal contexts and reflects the country’s geographical layout.
The “Boot” concept adds an element of charm to discussing Italy and is often used to help depict the different regions of the country. For example, the “toe” of the boot refers to Calabria, while the “heel” pertains to Apulia. This geographical representation enables both Italians and visitors to understand the country’s diverse geographical and cultural landscape better.
Another popular nickname that resonates with many people is “La Dolce Vita,” which translates to “The Sweet Life.” This phrase became particularly famous after the release of Federico Fellini’s 1960 film of the same name. The essence of “La Dolce Vita” captures the Italian spirit of enjoying life’s pleasures, from delicious food and wine to beautiful art and architecture.
Italy’s rich culinary tradition, full of regional specialties, delightful desserts, and world-famous wines, epitomizes this philosophy. Italians celebrate family gatherings, socializing over meals, and savoring life’s simple pleasures — an approach to life that many associate with the Italian way of living.
While not a nickname in the traditional sense, it is essential to note that the very name “Italia” carries immense historical significance. The term “Italia” originally referred to a specific region in Southern Italy and has roots dating back to the ancient Greeks. Over the centuries, the name expanded to encompass the entire country after the unification of Italy in the 19th century.
The name is derived from the ancient Italic tribes that settled in the region. Today, “Italia” is a source of pride for Italians and an integral part of the country’s identity. It represents the nation’s long history, rich cultural heritage, and diverse regional influences.
Italy is also often referred to as “The Land of the Popes” due to its historical and religious significance. With over 1,800 years of papal history, Rome is home to the Vatican City — the smallest independent state in the world and the spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church.
This nickname highlights Italy’s important role in the history of Christianity and its influence on global religious practices. Not only does it identify Italy with a significant aspect of its culture, but it also attracts millions of tourists annually who visit the Vatican to see treasures like St. Peter’s Basilica and the Sistine Chapel.
Italy is famously known as “The Cradle of the Renaissance,” a nickname that captures its historical importance as the birthplace of one of the most significant cultural movements in European history. The Renaissance, which occurred from the 14th to the 17th century, marked a period of rejuvenation in art, science, and thought, leading to monumental changes in society.
Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome were pivotal in showcasing revolutionary ideas and artistic achievements. Renowned artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael emerged during this time, and their works continue to be celebrated worldwide. The nickname reminds us of Italy’s enduring legacy as a cultural powerhouse.
Italy is known by several nicknames, including “Bel Paese” (Beautiful Country), “The Boot,” “La Dolce Vita” (The Sweet Life), “The Land of the Popes,” and “The Cradle of the Renaissance.”
Italy is colloquially referred to as the “Boot” because of its distinctive geographical shape that resembles a high-heeled boot on the world map. This nickname is useful for identifying different regions of the country, like referring to the “toe” or “heel.”
“La Dolce Vita” translates to “The Sweet Life,” reflecting the Italian ethos of savoring life’s pleasures, including food, art, and company. It symbolizes the relaxed and joyful approach to life that many associate with Italian culture.
Italy earned this nickname due to its significant role in the Renaissance, a period of cultural rebirth that began in the 14th century. Notable cities like Florence and artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo emerged during this transformative era, leading to lasting contributions in art, philosophy, and science.
The name “Italia” has historical roots, originating from ancient Italic tribes. It has since become a source of national pride and represents the country’s cultural heritage and diversity stemming from thousands of years of history.
Italy’s nicknames encapsulate the nation’s beauty, culture, and historical significance. From “Bel Paese” to “La Dolce Vita,” these monikers highlight the unique aspects of Italian life and the enduring impact that Italy has had on art, cuisine, and religion across the world. The richness of Italy’s nicknames is a testament to its profound influence over the centuries, drawing visitors from all around the globe to experience the magic of this remarkable country.

The alarm clock goes off at 7:00am. I immediately do my morning stretches before going for my habitual morning run, a few kilometers traversing the narrow, winding streets of Cinque Vie and around the Castello Sforzesco. After, either a bowl of whole-grain cereal mixed with bananas and strawberries and Turkish coffee. If I’m feeling extra Italian, a brioches al pistacchio topped off with a warm cup of cappuccino at the corner café. Then I’m off to work at my office located in the historic 14th century Palazzo Borromeo. Lunches would consist of either a plate of pasta or a protein-based dish, to be had on the fashionable piazza just in front of my office with a view of a 16th century church. In the evening, a drink or two at my favorite lounge at the Darsena neighborhood. Had it been Fashion Week or Design Week, a quick pit-stop at an after party or at a gallery opening before heading home to get a peaceful night’s rest.
This was how some of my days looked like in Milan, the city I called home for nearly a decade. I had moved to this bustling metropolis at the tender age of seventeen to study at university. With dreams as vast as the endless cityscape before me, I embarked on a voyage of self-discovery, leaving behind the familiar comforts of my hometown of Jakarta.
The streets of Milan hummed with the promise of adventure, each corner whispering secrets waiting to be uncovered. Amidst the towering skyscrapers and labyrinthine cobblestone alleyways, I found myself at the cusp of adulthood, navigating the intricate tapestry of urban life with a blend of trepidation and exhilaration. With every step, I wove my own narrative into the fabric of the city, carving out a place for myself amidst the chaos and possibility. And so, the saga of my odyssey began, a tale of resilience, growth, and the boundless potential of a longing to succeed.
This journey had not been without its lows. Finding myself in the midst of an international crowd had made it difficult to learn the local language, especially during my initial years in Milan. It was only when I started to join the workforce that the melody of the language began to spark a note within me. What had initially been thinking twice and endlessly practicing under my breath before going into a café to order an espresso eventually became second nature. Over the years, I had become a fixture at these cafés; the staff need not ask what I would like to order anymore, they simply bring me il solito, the usual. I am, after all, a creature of habit.
I owe much of my relative prowess in the language to my friends and colleagues, who patiently endured my stumbling attempts at conjugations. Their encouragement, coupled with countless laughs at my linguistic missteps, transformed my rudimentary grasp of Italian into something more coherent. Granted, they didn’t teach me to speak Italian; they taught me to speak Milanese, which is what some Italians regard as a refined blend of English and Italian generally spoken by overachieving business people and stylish fashion enthusiasts in the nation’s financial capital.
Covered in an abundance of arts and culture, my life in Milan had been rather colorful. I had the remarkable opportunity to come across people from diverse backgrounds, eat marvelous food, and travel relentlessly. However, it had not always been easy. When the pandemic hit at the onset of this decade, like many other young people starting off in their careers, I had struggled to cope with the stringent restrictions. I was fortunate enough to be living with two extraordinary people who respectively hailed from Spain and Sicily, who undoubtedly made my time in quarantine worthwhile. We would sit for hours over home-made Sicilian cuisine sharing stories about our lives prior to coming to Milan. As the sun-kissed Mediterranean flavors danced in our palates, we all felt extremely connected through the commonalities we had discovered in the stories we shared. Naturally, we all kept in touch after we went our separate ways, the Spaniard to Emilia Romagna and the Sicilian to her native island. She would sometimes send me the quintessential pacco da giù, a package usually sent by madres and nonnas of the South to their children and grandchildren in the North. She would fill these pacchi with paste di mandorla, my favorite Sicilian dessert after cannoli.
Among the bustling piazzas of the city, there lay a treasure trove of museums, each a sanctuary for treasured paintings and sculptures. These cultural havens became my beloved retreats, and further fueled my interest for the arts. I often find myself gazing at Francesco Hayez’s Il bacio, the masterpiece on display towards the end of the Pinacoteca di Brera, for prolonged periods of time. Michelangelo’s statue of David commands attention from its prominent position at the heart of the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence, about a two-hour train ride from Milan. I stood transfixed, drawn into the intricate details of this renowned sculpture. Florence offered more than its artistic treasures; as I wondered through its enchanting streets, I was greeted by breathtaking views of the Arno river and the red-tiled rooftops that stretched out before me. I indulged in copious amounts of Tuscan bread, each bite a revelation. Renowned for its lack of salt, it seemed to sing with the flavors of the region, a perfect complement to the rich olive oil and robust wines.
Having lived in one of the most prominent fashion capitals of the world, it would come to no surprise that I had made a great deal of friends that are somehow intertwined with the realm of haute couture. My interactions with them made me somewhat of an expert on the topic. Although I do struggle differentiating between cerulean and other shades of blue, I have learnt enough to know that my favorite fashion show is Alexander McQueen’s Ready-to-Wear Spring ’98; that Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace had a heated rivalry throughout the late twentieth century; and that Tom Ford had initially worked at Gucci before starting his eponymous brand.
Although Milan was beautiful in its own right during the day, it was the nights where the lion awakens in its den. A cocktail da asporto in hand listening to L’appuntamento by the majestic Ornella Vanoni, whilst casually staring at the latest pieces of high fashion embossed in fluorescent light at Via Montenapoleone. Those were the days.
Nestled in the heart of Lombardy, Milan offered a gateway to mountains, lakes, and beaches. This geographical blessing meant that adventures were never far away. During the sun-soaked summers, my best friend and I would embark on journeys to the charming coastal towns of Liguria in his sky blue vintage sedan listening to Italian hits from the ’80s. The salty breeze mingled with the nostalgia of the music, creating a soundtrack to our youthful escapades. As the seasons shifted and snow dusted the peaks, our attention turned to the Italian Alps. Bundled up in our warmest gear, we’d venture into the snowy expanse, eager to carve fresh tracks on the slopes. The thrill of skiing down those majestic mountains was unmatched, each run a new adventure waiting to be discovered.
Milan, with its strategic location at the heart of three international airports, was more than just a city; it was a launchpad to adventures far beyond its borders. International travel became a routine part of life. Den Haag to attend my sister’s birthday dinner? Easy. Frankfurt for my best friend’s wedding? Just another weekend trip. Athens for a bachelor’s party? Been there, done that. London to visit my uncle? A frequent flyer. From the cobblestone streets of Den Haag to the vibrant markets of Athens, each destination held its own allure and charm. Yet, no matter how far I traveled, Milan remained my anchor, always welcoming me back with open arms. It wasn’t just a city; it was the starting point for countless journeys, each one leaving an indelible mark on my soul. And for that, Milan will always hold a special place in my heart.
Navigating the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy was a trial by fire, one that tested my patience and resolve in ways I never imagined. The infamous Italian red tape was a beast of its own, one that many expats struggled to tame. I was lucky enough to emerge relatively unscathed, but I witnessed the battles of others who weren’t as fortunate. I quickly learned that trying to fight the system was like banging my head against a brick wall — painful and ultimately futile. So, I did what any survivor in Italy does: I adapted. One of my greatest accomplishments was obtaining my driver’s license in Italy. Months of grappling with specific terminology and enduring compulsory driving lessons, all conducted in Italian, were no small feat. If there is one way to master the art of driving, it is by maneuvering through the narrow streets of Milan while receiving colorful scolding in Italian from your instructor as you deftly dodge a Fiat 500 driven by a formidable nonna.
As my time in Milan drew to a close, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness at the thought of leaving behind spontaneous adventures. No more day trips to the serene beauty of Lago di Como or the romantic allure of Verona. But as I packed my bags, I knew that the memories of those carefree days exploring the wonders of Il Bel Paese would stay with me forever.
Italy became not just a destination but a journey of self-discovery, marking the beginning of my solo adventures in a foreign land. It was my first taste of independence, a chapter in my life where I learned to stand on my own two feet. I couldn’t claim to have made it solely on my own. Behind every step I took were the unwavering support and love of my family, friends, and colleagues. Their encouragement and guidance were the pillars that held me up during moments of doubt and uncertainty. Yet, Italy represented more than just a physical location. It was a decade-long odyssey, a tapestry woven with the threads of newfound friendships and unforgettable experiences.
Living away from my family and the friends I grew up with was a challenge, but it was also an opportunity to create a life enriched by the presence of beautiful souls who became like a second family to me. They shared in my triumphs and failures, my joys and sorrows, shaping the person I was becoming. As I reflect on my time in Italy, I realize that it wasn’t just about navigating a new country; it was about navigating the depths of my own soul. And in doing so, I discovered a strength and resilience I never knew I possessed. This country had taught me a great deal of things. But it is now time to say good-bye.
Arrivederci, Italia. Until we meet again.

There is none.
Ok that’s a lie — there’s some. But honestly, coming from a US upbringing it really means none. The study of “personal space” is called Proxemics, ever since 1963 when the cultural anthropologist Edward T. Hall, decided to name it extremely appropriately. Because of his wonderful work, more people have noticed this variation of how close people like to be to other people and studied it. So now we know that in North America, the average “appropriate” distance to be away from another person is literally longer than arms-length away at four feet. Italians, the culture that likes to smoosh their faces together multiple times while greeting, are absolutely fine with two to three feet of distance. I will attest to the fact that city Italians have an even smaller circle that hardly extends past their actual being. If I go into the center, I will absolutely touch other people. This is a given now, and I have accepted it for the most part. Today at the playground in the park, however, I couldn’t get over how these kids throw themselves around and over each other without a care.
The study continued to agree that “In Italy, it’s also common for people to establish extended physical contact when having an exchange. For instance, a person may reach for a friend’s forearm as a way to communicate openness and honesty or walk arm in arm with a coworker (of any gender) as they discuss something confidential.” Even when I was younger, I never minded a pat on the arm and thought it nice, so the casual physical interactions that happen here are endearing, and usually come from the older crowd. Older Italians are absolute suckers for babies and puppies and neither is safe from roaming cuddles and kisses. Maybe that’s why the kids Proxemics numbers are subzero numbers here. I’m pondering all this today as I watch three boys crawl over each other up the slide and then past Giulio as he was trying to go down it. It’s madness.
I grew up as one of maybe ten or so kids in our neighborhood that was surrounded by corn fields and woods. We didn’t have a swing set, but we had acres of land to ourselves. Of course, this mirrors throughout society and culture. In the US,I grew up with houses having backyards, grocery stores had parking lots as big as the piazzas here. Three grocery carts could pass in an aisle at the same time. I could do cartwheels in my bedroom. Here, if I did a cartwheel in any part of my house, I’d definitely be at the hospital. If I don’t have to wait for a traffic jam of carts to clear in the grocery store, it’s a good day. As described, the neighborhood fits about forty-eight (this is like a guess-the-jelly-beans-in-the-jar-number. I honestly have no idea. It’s a lot.) high-strung children from the ages of months to preteens in the size of a baseball diamond with four swings, and three slides. Of course youre going to get used to having less personal space — because there isn’t much to go around.
You know the little dance you do when someone else is in front of the item you need in the store? That awkward back and forth waiting for them to move? Not here. If someone wants something, they’ll get it. Maybe even move you out of the way a bit to do it. This, once accepted, is actually awesome when you can use it yourself.
Sometimes, it’s infuriating — this closeness. Sometimes, it’s pretty endearing. It certainly does bring everyone together — because we have to. Everyone is in everyone’s face always. So we learn to deal with each other — just like Giulio having no issue with being bowled over as he runs to the slide — with a special burst of confetti from the other kids on the way (it’s Carnevale here so paper confetti is a free-for-all and, again, everyone just accepts it). Of course, I still believe everyone needs a bit of personal space — and that that’s the best way to be. That’s why we get away every once in a while and have our garden out back. But as I live here longer, my bubble of personal space has gotten smaller, and I think maybe overall it’s a good thing. It really gets you in touch with the people around you. Ha!

Hey friend, congrats on getting married! The ceremony was absolutely beautiful. The church was so charming — though of course, not as breathtaking as the Sistine Chapel, where I went, by the way, when I studied abroad in Italy. Did I ever tell you about that?
My compliments to your caterers — the dinner was delicious. I loved your cute American lasagna buffet, but it’s just too bad you couldn’t serve authentic osso buco or cacio e pepe, which I ordered (and took pictures of for Insta) all the time when I lived among the locals in Napoli — or Naples, to non-Italians. Delicious cake, too — so adorable that it’s from a local award-winning bakery, which reminds me of this tiny rustic corner pasticceria I visited every day for tiramisu — or tiramisu, to non-Italians.
Speaking of Italy, you should have been there the first time I tried spaghetti al nero di seppia. Well, before the part where I spit it out after learning it was made from squid ink, then asked for chicky parm instead. Actually, most of the time I ate these fantastic simple buttery noodles from a part of the menu called bambinos, which in Italian likely means something like “very autentico adventuroso eaters.”

By Natia as told to the Samuel Hall team. Photographs by Tornike Begiashvili
This story was developed as part of Samuel Hall’s work with the FAiR Consortium, focusing on research conducted in Georgia. The FAiR (Finding Agreement in Return) project aims to improve the governance of return migration in the EU, addressing the challenges of legitimacy in return migration policies and exploring viable alternatives. As a partner in the project, Samuel Hall has been working to identify key public discourses and counter-discourses surrounding immigration, emigration, and (enforced) return, and to understand how these narratives are shaped and embedded in broader public and private conversations within non-EU source and transit countries, as well as diaspora communities. This story has also been published on the FAiR website, where you can read more about the project.
Navigating the complexities of dual identities, I grew up in Italy while maintaining deep roots in Georgian soil. I was born in Georgia, but my family and I relocated to Italy when I was just 3-years-old.
The decision to move came in the aftermath of a deadly conflict. Following the Abkhazian War in 1992, my family fled to Georgia and was facing considerable hardships — shuffling between the cities of Marneuli and Tbilisi.
Life was challenging; my father, a chef, earned a meagre salary. Fortunately, his culinary skills caught the attention of an Italian restaurant in Rimini, leading to an invitation to work there. Seizing the opportunity, he relocated our family to Italy in 1996.
We were warmly welcomed. Both of my parents worked at the restaurant, while my siblings and I attended Italian schools from kindergarten through graduation. We spent 21 years in Italy without facing any discrimination, immersed in a community that embraced us.
My parents believed that raising their children abroad would offer better opportunities. However, though our lives were primarily in Italy, my parents never let us forget about Georgia and always talked about, one day, moving back. As much as possible, we tried to maintain our culture — my parents would speak to me in Georgian, and I would respond to them in Italian.
As political and security conditions in Georgia improved, we began to return for vacations, reconnecting with our homeland. It enriched my connection to Georgia. We were welcomed by the community whenever we returned because we were always in touch with them. Every time I spent the summer here, I felt so good that I never wanted to go back to Italy.
My parents had always planned on returning and had bought a house. Owning a home in Tbilisi, my father started giving Italian cooking classes for aspiring chefs. Since all restaurants were closed, my father decided to start teaching people of all ages in order to help them find jobs after the pandemic. Our classes attracted numerous students, some of whom are still working as cooks in Georgia, Italy, and the US.
As the pandemic subsided, my father decided to establish deeper roots in Georgia rather than return to Italy. He expressed that he did not want to work for anyone else anymore. Given his love for hosting people and leveraging their special pizza oven, they opened our own restaurant. The community quickly grew to love our establishment.
My father was the best chef of Italian cuisine in Georgia. In the 2000s, you would rarely see an Italian restaurant in Tbilisi. He was a pioneer spreading the love for Italian cuisine in Tbilisi.
Initially, we only expected students to come for takeout. But then, more and more customers started coming in, and expressed their desire to eat at the restaurant rather than taking it home. We had to open additional rooms to accommodate everyone. So we added another section to make the restaurant bigger. We then added another room and put tables outside. Now we can host 90 diners. My father cooks, my mother makes pizzas, and I work as a waitress. We have also hired 10 additional wait staff.
People ask why we do not open another branch. We tell them we want to keep what we have built here, the taste and the food; it’s so organic. But lately, we have started considering it.
Returning to Georgia was slightly difficult for me because the mentality and lifestyle were very different.
We have a saying in Georgia, “Where you are going, you have to put on the same hat that they are wearing” — this is what we did in Italy and what we do here in Georgia.
When I returned at 18, I had to start reading and learning the language again. You start as if you are a foreigner.
Our identities are deeply intertwined with the culinary traditions we cherish. My favourite dishes — Khinkali from Georgia and pasta from Italy — mirror my dual heritage. I could enjoy pasta every day, delighting in a variety of sauces. Typically, weekends were reserved for indulging in pasta, soups, and pizza with friends. Currently, my diet leans more towards European cuisine; I can relish Italian meals several times a day. Georgian food, with its robust flavours, is something I savour less frequently, often opting for a restaurant experience when the craving strikes.
While we still go back to Italy to visit my brother and old friends, as far as the near future is concerned, we plan to stay in Georgia and expand our business operations — but Italy is still our second home, and my parents are grateful to Italy. When my father returned from Italy, there were few Italian restaurants in Georgia. He was the first to introduce authentic Italian cuisine here, bringing everything he had learned and observed in Italy to his ‘homeland’.
To continue the legacy, I will soon be opening a pizzeria with the help and knowledge of my parents. The pizzeria will be in Tblisi’s city centre and its name will be Rimini, the place in Italy where I grew up.

“Ciao, un caffè, per favore.” That’s how every morning started during my last holiday in Italy. Typically, these mornings I spent in small cafés, filled with the buzz of loud voices and the clink of espresso cups. These cafés made you feel at home with warm sunlight streaming through the glass windows and the fine aroma of coffee delicately wrapping around you. Among tanned locals, you order a tiny espresso cup with a glass of water, just like a typical Italian. Hot, bitter coffee runs through your veins, you place the cup back on the bar counter, put on your sunglasses, and then disappear into the narrow streets…
How did I get there? After an amazing lunch with pizza, my friend and I decided to spend a couple of weeks in Italy, visiting the most iconic cities and eating authentic Italian pizza, something we had always dreamt of doing. After researching, we chose four destinations: Florence, Rome, the Cinque Terre National Park, and Genoa. We booked Airbnb flats, packed small suitcases, and embarked on our greatest adventure to the land of sun, pizza, coffee, and delicious gelato.
An unusually bright and hot sun greeted us when we arrived in Florence. Though we were exhausted from the journey, we decided to take a short walk to the city center. We were staying quite close, on the opposite bank of the Arno river. The weather was perfect for a summer evening: warm, but with a light breeze.
Our first stop was Florence’s famous cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. The construction of this magnificent Renaissance dome began at the end of the 13th century. The vast Gothic structure is striking, with its front decoration showcasing an incredible mix of pink, white, and green marble. Due to circumstances, we couldn’t go inside, so we peered into the marvelous interior through the open door.
Next, we visited the less famous but charming church, Santa Croce. I have a special connection with this place. As a child, I visited Florence with my mum. Once, in a funny and somewhat scary moment, we nearly got lost and missed our group. We had to rush across the Santa Croce Square to meet our guide. It was our first trip abroad, and we were a little scared of getting lost in a city we’d never been to before. Fourteen years later, as an adult, I stood in front of that beautiful church, smiling at my childhood memories. I was surprised at how different things looked after so many years. The square in front of the church wasn’t as huge as I remembered it being as a child.
Then we went to the Roman crossing, the Ponte Vecchio, or Old Bridge. Since the 13th century, there have been shops lining the road across the bridge. In the evening, it becomes full of street musicians and couples. Ponte Vecchio is a very romantic spot in Florence, with its great views over the river and of the bridge itself. We arrived just as the sun was setting, and its pink and brown shops started to gleam gold, reflecting in the calm water. On the other side of the river, there were tiny identical cottages with pollards. Followed by the deep red-purple sunset, we sat down on the dry, rough grass and cooled ourselves with tasty gelato. While enjoying the amazing flavors, two police officers came to warn us about insects in the grass that could bite us. They didn’t speak English well but heartily tried to convey their message. In the end, they smiled and waved to us before moving on to another group of people.
After two full days in Florence, having walked over 30 kilometers each day, my friend stayed to rest in the city while I decided to visit Siena. What seemed like a casual trip to a nearby city turned into a wonderful adventure. I didn’t expect anything special and was pleasantly surprised.
Siena is a small city in the heart of the Tuscany region. The first thing I encountered was the Medici Fortress on my way from the railway station to the city center. The massive yellow stone building caught my attention with its high fortress walls. I guessed there might be nice views from the top, and I was right. It was afternoon, and from the top, I saw a magical skyline, a clear blue sky with thin white clouds, and wide verdant hills in shades of green. Then, I entered the old city. Its narrow streets led me into a labyrinth of yellow and red stone buildings that protected me from the hot Tuscan sun. A welcome coolness covered my shoulders and made me shiver a bit. I didn’t have a map, so I followed the signs on buildings and asked people for directions. The signs led me to the stunning Piazza del Campo, with its massive Palazzo Comunale and Torre del Mangia in the center of the town. The square was full of people, cafes, noise, and street vendors. There wasn’t enough space for all the tourists. I walked a few steps up from the square and faced the magnificent Duomo, which dominates Siena’s city center. It wasn’t as big as Florence’s Duomo but still very impressive. That day, I returned to the hotel very tired. Going up and down the hills was more exhausting than usual walking.
Rome, where history intertwines with modernity, is a place of contrasts, both noisy and peaceful.
An ancient city with a vast historical heritage, Rome impresses you from the first steps. I’m not referring to the arrival by train, as the railway station, while not the ugliest or dirtiest I’ve seen, is still somewhat unpleasant. After the relative calm of Florence, Rome overwhelms you with its noise and crowds. Initially, I thought the city itself would be less crowded than the railway station, but I was mistaken. Wherever you go, Rome is packed with people in June.
The district where we found an Airbnb flat was far from the city center and didn’t seem particularly safe at first glance, with many migrants and poorly dressed individuals. However, it didn’t feel like a rough part of town, and we didn’t encounter any problems. So, we left our bags and ran to explore the city.
As I mentioned before, I visited Italy fourteen years ago, including Florence, Rome, and a few small cities. I had dreamt of returning as an adult to not only see and remember everything but to truly experience it. Italy is all about the gesticulating Italians, the smell of pizza and coffee from every corner, enjoying your dinner with pasta and wine in small cafés with lovely views, and soaking in the special atmosphere that is unique to this country.
We planned to see the most famous sights like the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and the Vatican. We marked these spots on the map and decided to walk through the beautiful old streets rather than use public transport. We also didn’t plan where to eat, leaving it to chance, which added a spontaneous and adventurous spirit to our journey.
Compared to other Italian cities, Rome feels very big and noisy. I suppose it was peak tourist season, so we were a bit unlucky in that regard. Near all the major attractions, you constantly hear street vendors calling out “Cold water — 1 euro” or “Hat, buy a hat.” You simply want to enjoy the view and take photos, but it’s almost impossible due to the crowds and the persistent sellers.
We did a quick loop around the Colosseum, hurried by a strong, sandstorm-like wind. We delved into the labyrinth of streets and found another Roman gem — the Trevi Fountain, the largest Baroque fountain in the city and the most famous in the world. Unfortunately, the situation was the same there. The small square was overcrowded with tourists, making it difficult to get close to the fountain. We decided to return early the next morning, hoping it would be less crowded.
The next day, we woke up very early and by 6 a.m., we were already at the Trevi Fountain. The atmosphere was completely different from the previous day. The fresh morning air was much more pleasant than the scorching day heat. There were only a few tourists around, allowing us to enjoy the view. This was the perfect time to walk around the city and appreciate its ancient masterpieces. We had enough time to admire the gorgeous statues and throw a coin for luck into the blue water while the statue of God Oceanus watched us attentively. Bathed in the soft light of sunrise, we moved on to the Spanish Steps.
The Spanish Steps connect the Piazza di Spagna at the base with Piazza Trinità dei Monti, dominated by the Trinità dei Monti church at the top. The marble steps, polished by thousands of feet, shone in the bright sun. Lazy, yawning tourists began to appear, and we even saw several weddings having photo sessions on the steps.
We continued our walk and arrived at the Quattro Fontane square, an ensemble of four Late Renaissance fountains installed in the 16th century at the intersection of Via delle Quattro Fontane and Via del Quirinale. The morning sun was starting to bring its summer warmth, and we chose the shady side of the road as we headed toward the Vatican.
The Vatican hardly needs an introduction. There’s plenty of information available in any guidebook, but I advise you to plan your visit carefully. Be aware of Catholic holidays and check the opening hours of St. Peter’s Basilica.
Standing in front of one of the largest churches in the world, I remembered an episode from my childhood. When I first visited with my mom, it was nearly dark. Yellow lamps cast a warm glow over the square. Our driver, who didn’t speak English well, tried to tell me something in Italian. Finally, he pointed to the Apostolic Palace and said, “Papa. Roma. Window.” It was the most memorable moment of that trip. Though I enjoyed the old buildings and their significant history, I couldn’t fully appreciate them as a child. However, that summer night, standing near the native who proudly showed me the Pope’s window, I felt something incredible. As an ordinary girl, I was standing just meters from the head of the Catholic Church and the Vatican, whom I’d only seen on television. It felt almost magical. As an adult, I felt the same childlike wonder when we returned. I showed my friend that window with a warm smile, remembering the Italian driver.
After a busy day of walking, we moved to the most beautiful and colorful area of Rome — Trastevere, which feels like a different city. After ancient forums, ruins, and historical sites, there isn’t as much to see, but the atmosphere is entirely different.
The busy city blurs in the dim sunlight as we step into the Trastevere area. Its narrow cobblestone streets are picturesque, lined with ochre-colored buildings entwined with bushy green plants, arched passageways, and old doorways with antique door knockers. Don’t miss this atmospheric place. My friend from Rome recommended a café known for its famous pasta — tonnarelli. Although there was a long queue for a table, it was worth the wait. The outdoor tables, warm yellow lights, loud emotional Italians, and delicious food created a recipe for small happiness.
We finished our pasta late in the evening and took a walk around the city. It had completely transformed. The day’s heat had given way to a fresh breeze. Tourists had disappeared from the streets. Bright day colors had faded, replaced by ochre and dark brown hues under the cozy yellow street lamps. Magic was in the air, filling us with complete happiness.
The next day, we left Rome. It will always hold a special place in my heart. Rome is where treasures can be found around every corner, and even the most unassuming streets hold incredible history. You just need to ease your mind and enjoy the city, where history intertwines with reality in a quaint way.

After the problems with my passport finally subsided (not so funny story: it was expired and I had to leave the country to renew it, but couldn’t leave the country with an expired passport), my family decided it was time to venture out further than our usual trips from northern to southern California and organize our first visit to Europe. The planning process was strenuous as each of us tried to melt our ideas of the perfect adventure together, but looking back I could not be happier with how it played out. One of the most memorable experiences, in fact, was our two-day deviation from the mainstream: Quercianella.
Rather than hitting every crowded tourist destination in Italy, we rented a car in Florence and drove down the Tuscany coast, stopping first at Sienna, and then ending at a miniature beach town by the name of Quercianella.
A town where you could count the number of restaurants on your hands, and every resident was likely on a first-name basis, this was the epitome of an escape. The air smelled of salt and the temperature was perfectly warm. Every one there seemed care-free — families walked freely on the sides of the road, shop owners sipped coffee outside, and you could see locals laying on the stretches of rock and beach basking in the sun and purely enjoying the company of friends or a good book.
After driving down the town’s narrow roads for a while, we found our “Villa Margherita” and unpacked starved, ready to uncover the local wonders. Being a Yelp-connoisseur, I offered to scour the food scene, but soon realized that Yelp did not carry much weight in this little town. So, we slipped on our sandals and just began to walk. After following the main road for a few minutes, we turned onto a street with a gelateria on the corner, and quickly found a pizzeria nearby.
We sat outside on a string-lit patio and soon began speaking with the waiter, who also happened to be the owner’s son. In contrast to the people working the service desk at the hotel, with whom we had to communicate through vague hand gestures, he spoke a great amount of English. It was a comforting revelation, since the town probably did not get many tourists coming from the US. So, taking advantage, my dad asked for dish recommendations. He told us to get a pizza each, as they were personal-sized and he could easily finish one or two. We probably should have known that his idea of personal would differ than ours, however, and when he brought them to the table, all my sister said was “it’s almost bigger than me!” I wasn’t complaining though; we ended up taking the leftovers for a late-night snack.
At the end of our delicious meal, we were greeted by another unexpected surprise. We began talking to the owner and his son about where we were from (Palo Alto, California), and the son’s face suddenly lit up. It turned out he had lived a couple miles away from us for ten years while working his past job, after which he decided to take some time to move back home and work with his father. Our meal then turned into a night of laughs and good conversation as we exchanged stories of California and got to know the family of the pizzeria.
Even in a seemingly random beach town, we found a connection to our home thousands of miles away. The unexpected link was a reminder that we live in a minuscule world where the owner of a pizza place you happen to stumble on in Tuscany could very well have once been your neighbor.

When I travel alone, I am the complete opposite of someone who obsessively plans every part of their journey. I obsessively try to avoid planning as much as humanly possible until the absolute last minute when I need to figure out what I’m supposed to do before my flight back home.
Back in Autumn 2023, during a month in Puglia, I suddenly felt I’d spent enough time eating focaccia in Bari, and decided to visit the coast of Salento, specifically a charming beachside town called Gallipoli. A few hours by local train later, passing through rolling hills and small charming Apuglian towns, I was there.
I walked around the historical center, ate pizza, and enjoyed the perfect weather and view of the beautiful Ionian Sea. None of my pictures do the place justice, especially considering I went to the beach without a camera or phone (since I went alone), so I was unable to capture the most magical sunset I have ever seen in my life — as the sun hit the horizon, a lone tree on a small island acted like the iris in a…

Seated backward on a high-speed TGV approaching the 8.5-mile-long Mont Cenis tunnel, I unwrapped a piece of Tome des Bauges I had purchased hours earlier at Chambéry’s Marché Des Halles.
Next to it on my tray table, I had a tiny baguette, given to me free at La Panière, just outside the Marché. Thankfully, the bistro on board offered wooden cutlery so that I could cut the rind.
I was even more grateful that the bistro sold a crisp Pays d’Oc chardonnay to accompany my 11 am snack.
This grassy, somewhat stinky cheese would be my last taste of the French Alps on this trip.
I would soon enter a tunnel that would take me under 6,000 feet of rock — pushed upward by tectonic collisions 30 million years ago — and when I emerged, I would be in Italy

GOSPEL songs — earworms! — play in my head constantly now after two intense weeks of learning them with a choir touring Tuscany. We weren’t a choir before we boarded our respective flights, but we are a choir now.
And right now I can ‘hear’ a very beautiful Italian prayer-song, Signore Delle Cime — Lord of the [mountain] Peaks — in my mind and I, a non-believer, am nevertheless deeply moved. Who wouldn’t be?
Signore Delle Cime asks the Lord to take ‘our friend’, a fallen mountaineer, up to heaven covered ‘with a soft white blanket’. It soars.
Then there was Bella Ciao, the rousing hymn of the partisans who would die for la liberta. It seems all Italians know that one.
The 30 singers in our choir are mostly Australian and we also have a sassy soprano from Canada who lives in New Zealand, three terrific tenors (Scotland, Canada and New Zealand), and an Irish lass, our scintillating soloist and queen of the altos, who lives in Melbourne.
We learned songs, mostly gospel in nature, in Italian, French, Samoan, Zulu (yes!) and English. And we performed a selection of them in two churches, one in the gentle medieval town of Mercatello sul Metauro in the Marche region that borders Tuscany, and another in Firenze. (The angelic altos are pictured above.)
Our maestros were exceptional talents — Guerrino Parri in Mercatello, Edoardo Materassi who taught us in the first week of our tour in Montestigliano, near Siena, and in Firenze, and Tony Backhouse, who taught us for the entire two weeks. Many readers will know Tony from his acclaimed Sydney-based choir, the Café at the Gates of Salvation Gospel Choir, as well as his Heavenly Light Quartet. That’s him, below, with Guerrino in the background getting ready to begin.
Each of these three conductors was a joy to watch at work. So knowledgeable — so animated! — and able to sing each part (bass, tenor, soprano, alto), they lifted us up with their energetic love of the music and of teaching it. What a joy.
Members of Guerrino’s choir in Mercatello joined us for our concert there, and in Firenze we were treated to exceptional performances by Edoardo’s choir, Animae Voces, who also joined us for some tunes.
Now I am in Anghiari, ‘my’ beloved medieval village near Arezzo, very happy to be here again so unexpectedly soon, thanks to one person dropping out of the singing tour before it began. [I spent last November and December here.] ‘Making Music in Italy’, organised by a Byron Bay-based outfit, The Create Escape, had been fully booked when I inquired about it months before. When I tossed my cap in, I assumed it unlikely that a spot would become available — but it did! So, with just four weeks to get myself prepared — flights, insurance, what to do after the tour, and so on — I said yes. Life is short, yes?
I have always eschewed the idea of group tours, but now I am very glad I took what felt like a leap of faith and dived in. The accommodation in Montestigliano, Mercatello and then Firenze was excellent and interesting in different ways; we ate sumptuous meals, had some lovely parties and stimulating side trips as well as the pleasure of learning. (You can see a snippet of one of those parties here.)
One of the side trips was to the hilltop restaurant Il Girone dei Golosi just out of Mercatello; another was to the beautiful organic winery Pomaio near the town of Arezzo where we went for lunch on the way to Firenze (see pics below).
I’m sure we all made some lovely new friends. (And here I must make special mention of Susie and David from the Northern Rivers who had the brilliant idea of making this tour the first leg of their honeymoon! It was a treat for all of us to have them along.)
Now I’ve seen more of Tuscany than I had before. It is my fifth time visiting Anghiari and I’ve opted to spend a month here to catch up with acquaintances I have come to know and love. After all, the airfare is just the same for six weeks as for two, isn’t it?
A presto. Mimi :)
PS: If you would like to see the choir in action, some parts of our concerts can be found on YouTube. Go to ‘Making Music in Italy, 2024’. You’re welcome. xx

It was June 2023 when I drove to Italy for 3 weeks to find a second house or a renovation project in Italy. I had sold my house in the Netherlands as I felt it was time to move forward without any mortgage. Freedom.
Initially I was focussed on moving to Spain. My boyfriend’s native language is Spanish, and learning Spanish is already a challenge. Putting another language in the mix like Italian, didn’t feel very useful. Long story short, I couldn’t get a homy feeling in Spain, and I always loved and felt connected with Italy. Italy it was.
Like many house searchers, Idealista is a great way to start. With a long list of 50+ houses I drove to my preferred area around Lucca and further up the coast in Liguria. Obviously many houses weren’t at all what they seemed online, but more, I couldn’t see myself living in those areas. Secondly, I was all over the place with what I was looking for: a nice holiday home or a golden gem like a big mansion to renovate.
Having one week left, I went back to the heart of Piemonte where I had spent the first 2 nights. I ended up in a B&B owned and run by Francesca. We clicked and I loved the area: the rolling soft hills with its vineyards, the laid back little villages with one bar in the center as the communal place to meet each other for coffee or an aperitivo.
I visited some more houses in the area but nothing came even close to making my heart jump a tiny bit with excitement. This is not the right way, I felt. Let’s reverse the process: stop hunting, trust that life will show me what or where to look next. As a side note, I always bought the houses I lived in very intuitively, which has never let me down. In fact, it has given me a lot of financial expansion over the years.
I just posted my ‘I trust the universe’ post on facebook when the cousin of Francesca stepped into the garden. 10 minutes later, he offered to show me his house down the road that he bought a year ago. Would I be interested to buy his house as his plans had changed?
Is this a sign? Curious as I am, I said that I would be open to explore. It wasn’t love at first sight. It wasn’t the Liberty House from early 20th century with heigh painted ceilings I was hoping to find, but it was huge! And that ignited my interior design excitement. I love a good renovation challenge! I have had my design business for 13 years, and although I never see myself in that role again, I love to be my own client!
3 Months later I signed the contract, and became resident in one day. The house, with a potential of 600m2 living space and 14000 m2 land, was mine. Definitely a design challenge as 40% of the house, the barn with its hay attic, needs a complete transformation. For Italian standards the whole process went very smoothly, mainly due to great help I received from the seller!
Why did I say yes? It just felt like the one thing to do. Not just buying it, but to move out of the Netherlands immediately and start something new. It all felt right: the potential of the house with 7–8 bedrooms and the potential for an equal number of bathrooms, living spaces to share and some to keep private, enough space for my children to come and stay, alone or with their friends and the idea of creating a business sanctuary, whatever that will be…I felt a new phase opened up. How exciting!
Back to the summer of 2023. My partner wasn’t as thrilled as I was when I showed him the house the first time. Understandable! His favourite spot to visit, the Netherlands, was suddenly swapped for a rural area with a bunch of farmers. Having a long distance relationship for 6 years now, travelling between Lima-Peru and The Netherlands very frequently, has worked well for us, but will it be the same with my drastic move?
While I didn’t really involve my partner in the decision, I did involve my 3 (young adult) children! Perhaps not realising the complete impact of this move, they were supportive of my choice. I feel blessed with their ability to give me this space although it certainly hasn’t always been easy for them for different reasons.
So here I am, 14 months later. A year of learning and rooting. Slowly learning the language. Connecting with the ground I live on. Making the house with simple means a home for now until the renovation is done. Enjoying the simplicity of life in the country. Meeting so many beautiful new people, of which a few are becoming good friends.
And of course, not everything goes easy and smoothly. My renovation started with a classic mistake, trusting the wrong person and ignoring my inner doubt as I was too eager to get started. It has cost me quite a sum of money with which I had come to terms with for myself. I felt so angry and frustrated but also a bit ashamed with my mistake. Shouldn’t I know better as an experienced renovator and intuitive person?
I stopped working with the first contractor, continued with his collaborating partner (as he was a victim of the whole situation as well) to finish the terraces and new swimming pool. Normally one starts with the house and the outer areas are last on the list. For sure it will turn out quite unpractical to have a new terrace while the whole house needs to be taken care of, but I am so happy I enjoyed a first summer with a lovely space outside and my beautiful new swimming pool. At least the pool can’t fall of the budget anymore! A lovely first summer, sharing it all with friends, family, and of course my children.
While I moved on my own to a country where I didn’t know anyone, I can’t say I ever felt alone or lonely. In fact, in between all the visits, and my own travelling to the Netherlands, Peru and some other places, I am happy to have some weeks on my own. I love the different seasons: fresh sunny spring, warm rain free summer, foggy autumn mornings and cold winters with the snowy mountains of the Alps as a postcard view from my terrace.
And the house? For a while I didn’t want to renovate it at all. I live so comfortably already, and I have enough rooms for guests to stay. My youngest spontaneously brought 7 friends for a week around New Years Eve. My son enjoyed a week in the summer with 6 of his friends! And you know, sharing 2 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms worked fine for everyone.
But after a few months, I felt the excitement bubbling up for the next phase of the renovation. I refreshed my skills so I could use my design software again. It had been a while but I really loved solving this big puzzle. How to make the best out of the house. This part had always been my favourite element of my interior business: creating the most optimal living spaces, a natural flow, all within the limits of the building and a budget. To me it is the definition of simplicity: creating such a design that solves all complexity (integrate all wishes affordably, elegantly, beautifully and within the limited space) while the results looks very natural like the house has always meant to be like that. In other words, I don’t like over designed houses for the sake of creating something new and expensive.
The house had grown on me, which made me change some of my initial ideas. I finalised the complete design in September. Now what? How to find the right contractor(s) this time? One that is flexible to find affordable and beautiful solutions: my budget is limited and my standard is high! But more importantly, finding one who is willing to work differently from the very bureaucratic way that is known in Italy and very costly in my view.
I did hire a geometra. A geometra works within the triangle of the municipality, the contractor and the house owner. A geometra can easily take 15–20% of the budget as an add on! That is excluding the costs for an architect, an interior designer and an engineer (for constructive calculations). I decided to hire my geometra only for the permit, the (ridiculous but mandatory) safety and security rules and some engineering guidance. I followed the same process as I did in the Netherlands for many years to receive budget proposals from 4 contractors. Well, that already made a pre-selection. Two of them resigned as they didn’t like my way. They would only give a quote based on the standard procedure here where the geometra prepares the whole costing format. Basically this means, they only have to fill in the price per item and you get a very clear overview per contractor what his offering is. Sounds great and good for comparing budgets, but quite costly for me and way less flexible.
Now I am left with 2 parties who both feel like good companies to work with. One of them is very eager to grow his business and the other has an established contracting business. I haven’t finalised the deals yet, but it feels like the project will be divided amongst these 2 parties.
I am excited to get started, to work with the workers wherever I can, find solutions and the right materials. I am best when I can design the little details in the moment.
Please follow along in this blog to read about my weekly updates, surprises, joys, fun facts and challenges as I navigate this BIG project!

When it comes to food, I do not mind experimenting now and then. While health has overtaken taste as the most significant determining factor, there’s always the possibility of eating healthy without making significant compromises when it comes to taste.
Having said that, there’s one food item for which I detest the idea of having plenty of options at my disposal or, for that matter, appreciating the modifications made during its preparation. I am very rigid when it comes to pizza. It is a personal favorite, and I look forward to enjoying every slice. As such, I prefer to play it safe, at least from my side.
I stick to margherita, the classic Italian variant, and refrain from having a detailed look at the menu of any pizzeria or restaurant. It is the safest option to place your bets on, I believe. Despite not being a picky eater per se, it will suffice to say that I am prudent when it comes to pizza. In fact, I even detest the idea of modifying or distorting my preferred choice.
There’s one aberration to that rule, though. I do not hesitate to contemplate another alternative if I’m…

Been working in italy since 2014. Tipping was frowned upon. Then cover charges started popping up. Just got back after 3 weeks in Rome, Florence, and Rimini and EVERY restaurant had cover charges. At one restaurant the GS (servizo incluso) on checks plus the coperto (cover charge) equaled 50% of what I paid. I spent more between them than I do paying 20% in the US. I didn’t get back to France and Spain this year and wonder if they are doing the same?

A few days before Christmas, Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli was welcomed back to Earth after a long tour on the International Space Station.
During his four-and-a-half months he posted some of the most amazing photos and images of Italy from space… And he became the first astronaut in space to make pizza aboard the International Space Station.
With the end of his latest tour on the International Space Station, Nespoli has spent so far a total of 313 days, 2 hours, and 36 minutes in space.
We can’t thank him enough for his photos and the amazing posts on social media.
To celebrate the upcoming new year, Italy, and the beauty of our country, and to thank Nespoli and all Italian astronauts, we decided to publish a mini collection of some of the most beautiful images of Italy from space, as logged by Nespoli and other astronauts in 2017.

Have you ever felt emotionally affected by a place that seems untouched by time? Matera is a city I love visiting. It’s a place that left an impression on me when I took a childhood church pilgrimage with mamma, and it’s a place that so instantly brings a great sense of appreciation to my life.
During a not so recent trip to Italy, I visited yet again this magical UNESCO site I encourage everyone to visit at least once, except this time I experienced the most humbling moment. As I was standing at the Chiesa Di Santa Maria Di Idris (Saint Mary of Idris), I was overwhelmed by the beauty and history surrounding me. As I walked through the church, I struck up a conversation with Rocco, a kind, older gentleman who volunteers to maintain this sacred space. His genuine interest in sharing the church’s history, with my genuine curiosity to know the deep roots of this sacred timecapsule, immediately fostered a sense of trust. He invited me to a hidden space behind the church, a small terrace with a breathtaking view of the cave dwellings below. As I stood there, looking out over centuries of history, I was moved to tears — this was more than a moment; it was a connection to the soul of Italy. I found myself at the mercy of a moment so raw, so full of the history and struggles of the people who lived and fought to survive there, that I was left breathless, feeling like I was part of something much larger, something that words alone could never express. After I took it all in, we returned inside, chatted some more, exchanged numbers and I left with the greatest gift of Matera — learning it’s history from someone who’s parents understood firsthand the art of making do with very little, and living a life of ration — something I boldly claim none of us reading this have any understanding of.

Out my window in New York I can see a tall white slice of a building where the Russian diplomatic corps lives. In that contained compound, there’s also a long, low building with a big round window, a school for their children. What are the mindsets of people there — especially when they see protesters waving the Ukraine flag across the street? What kind of history lessons do they teach those kids?
I mention this curious, closed-off world because it’s the kind of environment that can send fiction writers down long trails of exploration. And if all their research and imaginings lead to a vivid, unusual tale, readers may scratch their heads and wonder how the heck the writer came up with it.
When I read a new novel by Paolo Bacigalupi, Navola, I did some of that proverbial head scratching. It’s set in an alternative version of Renaissance Italy, filled with deception, vast wealth, and cut-throat power plays. So many questions surfaced in my mind, which led to some unexpected discoveries.
Before getting into that, here’s a little bit about Bacigalupi and the novel. If you’re a sci-fi fan, you might have gone head-over-heels for his first published novel, The Windup Girl, which picked up two of the most prized awards in the genre, a Hugo and a Nebula, along with other honors. Maybe you read some of his work that came after that — until he disappeared from the literary scene. Then last year, he rose up once again with Navola.
This marks the first time that Bacigalupi has dived into the fantasy genre. He sidestepped many of the usual suspects — magic spells, knights, princesses, witches, elves. But he did dust off the old dragon trope and gave it a strange quality. We first learn about it in the book’s opening paragraph, which begins:
“My father kept a dragon eye upon his desk. An orb larger than a man’s skull, gone milky and crystalline but still burning with inner fire as if it retained life.”
MISFIT IN A POWERFUL FAMILY
The narrator is a boy, and later a young man, born into a banking family. The young scion, Davico, may be extraordinarily wealthy, but he can’t meet the huge expectations of the father he so reveres. Davico is educated in warfare and how to perceive the dark secrets that are rife in Navola, the city-state where he lives. He pushes himself to become a master negotiator and to achieve far-reaching knowledge about all the bank’s clients. But he seems to always fall short. His passions and natural gifts lie elsewhere.
One of his gifts has to do with that dragon’s eye. The relic isn’t mentioned very frequently and seems inert to everyone but Davico, who senses its pent-up power. It seems like it’s going to do something. But what? I read much later into the night than I should have, wondering about that.
Another reason for my sleep deprivation had to do with a character named Celia. She arrives just after Davico’s father wreaks revenge against her family, which had plotted to overthrow his power. The father decides to adopt Celia, giving Davico an unexpected sister. It makes for an awkward introduction.
Over the course of the novel, Celia transforms from a subdued, quiet girl into a vivacious wit who is able to navigate through the treacherous, opulent world much more easily than Davico.
A third reason why I couldn’t stop reading relates to Bacigalupi’s master skills of foreshadowing, teasing the reader about what’s to come without giving much away. Consider the confessional tone of Davico in this passage, which is addressed to his readers:
“I have lost interest in hiding who I was or what I have become. I am tired of the lies and excuses, and wish only to lay myself bare before you, so that you at least will understand, even if you do not forgive.”
In addition to all my curiosity about where the book was headed, I also started to wonder about Bacigalupi’s inspirations and how the book had come about. It was so different than what I’d read of his other work.
It wasn’t hard to discern that novel’s world was some ancient version of Italy. Bacigalupi also invented certain words, gestures and body markings that seemed to borrow from Italian culture. But where was that all coming from? With a name like Paolo Bacigalupi, I assumed that he had an Italian family history. I was wrong.
My research uncovered an unexpected set of circumstances. Navola’s storyline came to him at a time when he was no longer interested in exploring the sci-fi topics he’d become known for, like changes in the world due to extreme weather and bioengineering.
‘NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,’ NEW AVENUE
He explained his mindset in a Write-Minded podcast interview: “A lot of the [future] trends that my brain locks onto are the frightening ones. And so you end up spending time being sort of anxious in your daily life. And then you go into this creative space where you actually expand on those anxieties and go deeper and deeper into them. And it builds this sort of, I don’t know, synergistic toxicity. And eventually I just broke down, fundamentally. I kind of had a nervous breakdown.”
A new way forward gained momentum during a trip to Italy with a friend, who wanted to learn Italian by living in Bologna. Bacigalupi had gone along for the ride. But it turned into so much more than that. Italian architecture and history proved fertile ground for his imagination, and that’s so evident in Navola’s landscape.
“One of the things about Bologna was all these rival families in the city would build these towers, and they were defensive towers for their families, but they were also statements of wealth and importance,” he told Locus magazine in a December 2024 article.
“The landscape is telling you something about politics, saying, ‘Oh, this city is not a cohesive political unit, even though you’ve got a wall that goes around the whole city — inside it, there are armed factions who war with each other, and retreat into their towers when they’re unsafe, then come out and attack each other. They’d imprison one another in their towers, all sorts of stuff. You can see this layer of anarchy clearly established in the architecture, and that’s not something that I would have organically thought of, but it’s something that I could observe and then steal and bring into my own world.”
There was at least one unexplored story thread in Navola that I kept waiting to play out as the pages turned. And while it never did, I suspect it was a little hint about what’s to come. At the time he was interviewed by Locus, Bacigalupi had written 60,000 to 80,000 words of a sequel book. As with Navola, it will be published by Knopf.
“I’m going to let the story be as long as it wants to be. If I need to go back to Knopf and offer another book, I’ll do that. If I can wrap it up elegantly in two, I’ll do that,” he said at that time. “I’m trying to be as loose as I can with it and allow the thing to take on the shape that it wants.”
With or without that dragon’s eye, I’ll be waiting.

Favorite Chocolate Shops in Italy
With Valentine’s Day, thoughts turn to chocolate. Here’s an excerpt from “100 Places in Italy Every Woman Should Go” to help you find the best places for chocolate in Italy…
“Let them eat chocolate,” was the kind proclamation of Madama Reale.
The year was 1678. Madama Reale was thirty years old, widowed, with a boy to raise, and had become the ruler of the Piedmont region in northern Italy. She took her job seriously and carried on major beautiful changes to the city during her reign , continuing in the tradition her husband had began, remodeling the Palazzo Madama into pretty French style.
In Madama Reale’s day chocolate was a precious novelty served only to royalty and priests. It had come to Italy through the Spanish explorer Cortez, who found it in South America.
When a Turin baker asked Madame Reale’s permission to make chocolate for regular folk, I imagine she figured, “Why not?” She probably needed the seritonin fix to deal with the hassles of being a female ruler and wanted to pass on the high to keep her popularity ratings up.

Or how a Balinese priest told me who I would marry
“There’s a wonderful old Italian joke about a poor man who goes to church every day and prays before the statue of a great saint, begging, ‘Dear saint — please, please, please… give me the grace to win the lottery.’ This lament goes on for months. Finally the exasperated statue comes to life, looks down at the begging man and says in weary disgust, ‘My son — please, please, please… buy a ticket.”
That profound realisation is from the blockbuster book Eat Pray Love. In the iconic movie scene, Julia Roberts says these words while overlooking ancient Rome. I have seen this film time and again, but I didn’t realise it until last year — did I just relive Eat Pray Love itself?
Dear saint, I did buy three tickets years apart… to Italy, India and Bali… and my lottery is a prophecy.
Italia… amore a prima vista! I was a teenager on my birthday when I first set foot in Italy. The fact that I don’t recollect the exact year is evidence that I speak of time long passed. It was a high school trip and my highlight was Casa di Giulietta (or Juliet’s house) in Verona. I revive the memory of a line of people flocking to this medieval tiny courtyard with one wish in mind — to find true love. Standing before the statue of Juliet, supposedly where Romeo wooed her, I was observing how everybody was writing their names on a wall, followed by symbols and dates important for them, as well as the name of their crush, husband or partner.
And then there was me. I found myself in front of the wall with a pen in my hand. I wrote ‘’Mila’’ followed by a tiny doodle of a heart. And then I looked up to the sky and set out the following intention ‘’I left the space next to my name empty. Let whoever is meant to be with me, write their name next to mine. And let the universe do its magic and introduce me to that person in divine timing.’’ Something inside of me as a young girl told me that I was probably the only one who did that.
But the woman in me today knows who wrote their name next to mine.
Namaste, India! It was my 21st birthday. The land of contrast. The thing about India is that you either love it or you never want to go back. I fall in the first category. I call to mind entering a Hindu temple for the first time in my life. ‘’No phones allowed’’ — it said on a very high fence. As a 21-year-old just entering the era of Instagram this is the last thing you want to hear. ‘’Well, I don’t have a choice’’ — I said to myself while proceeding to entering the temple. If you have been to India, you know that New Delhi is chaotic. Yet, somehow this Hindu temple was the trailer to how tranquillity feels like in the hustle and bustle of the big city.
The only time before that I was in awe of a building was in Barcelona when I entered La Sagrada Família. But Akshardham Temple in Delhi was something magical. This was the exact moment when I fell in love with India, Hinduism and Asia. I stood in front of the central sanctum and in a trice I couldn’t see anyone else. It was just me and this massive gold statue before me. The entire world went still. It was a fleeting moment, but it was something that I couldn’t explain to myself. What I know for sure, though, is that if I had my phone with me I wouldn’t have had this memory.
Om Swastiastu, Bali! I had to go back to Asia. The older you grow, the more life pushes you to search for peace, meaning and answers. ‘’Om Swastiastu, Miss Mila, my name is Ketut, nice to meet you.’’ No way. Did he say Ketut? I just rewatched the movie Eat Pray Love (which is by the way based on a true story) on my flight to Bali and if you have seen it, you know who Ketut is in the story. To make the picture even more unbelievable, Ketut that stood before me is a local priest in Ubud.
One morning, before inviting me to a Balinese family celebration that happens only once every 30 years, we had a talk about life. I shared that I wanted to visit a local palm reader. Sometimes when you’re desperate, you look for answers from places you never thought you would run to. ‘’I do’’ — he said, ‘’but you don’t have time for this today… have you visited The Pyramids of Chi? I think you should go’’ — said Ketut, accompanied by a witty smile, as if he almost knew what would happen there.
Like I wrote in another article, the gods always travel incognito. Ketut was convincing in an almost demanding way, leaving me with no choice but to go to those pyramids. I went to the reception and asked for a ticket for the first session available. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was in a pyramid built on top of a rice field, about to meditate to the sound of a gong. And let me tell you — I was the type of person that could never do yoga or meditate.
I still find it hard to put into words what happened to me that morning. I started having visions, one of which was a very specific necklace with a lotus flower. Once the session was over and it almost felt like I just woke up for the first time in my life, my legs took me to the giftshop. And guess what — that exact necklace I saw in my meditation was sold at their shop! I got goosebumps. A receptionist approached me and said to me ‘’Miss, this is the last necklace.’’ Nothing is a coincidence and signs do exist.
A year later, fate took me to Bali again, despite planning to go to Thailand instead. I had to go back to those pyramids again. I needed more answers. It was not an easy task to revisit a place without the burden of the expectations from the first time. However, I told myself that if those visions are a reality and not just my mind playing tricks on me, I must see the number 17 immediately when I leave the pyramid.
The sound healing was done. I ran to grab a piece of my favourite peanut butter chocolate cake and drink a comforting cup of ceremonial cacao. The woman at the counter handed me a note with a number and told me to put it on the table so they know where to bring my order. I grabbed it without looking and started playing with a frangipani flower that fell next to me. I sat down, a waiter brought my cake and to my astonishment I looked up — the table number I was given was… 17. And next to the cake the word ‘’love’’ was written with strawberry jam.
Then I went back to my homestay and Ketut asked me the mandatory question of how my day was. How do I tell this man that he sent me to a place that changed my life? I was looking for a palm reader, but I ended up being my own palm reader. What really made my jaw dropped was what Ketut asked me. ‘’Mila, do you have a partner?’’ and before I could even respond he continued — ‘’You have already met him, I saw him’’ and then with that same smile he gave me last year, he walked away and wished me good night. He saw him? What did he mean?
I don’t really have an ending for this story. An ending would imply that a cycle is completed. Yet, why does it feel like this cliffhanger by a Balinese priest is just the beginning? Or maybe I myself started this prophecy by writing my name on a wall in Italy over 14 years ago? And… what if maybe he also told me who I will marry?
Let’s connect!

The Alps are the highest and the most extensive mountain group in Europe, extending across 8 countries: France, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia.
In this chapter, I focus on the road trip I did last year on the first nine days of May, driving from Southeast Switzerland to northern Italy, Tyrol Austria and Liechtenstein. If you prefer only to visit the Swiss Alps click here.
The last stop in Switzerland before crossing the border to Italy.
Lake Como
Driving along the lake’s road through the towns of Domaso, Menaggio, Lenno, Laglio…and at the southern tip Como, where we stayed a night.
Picturesque and romantic city
Lake Endine
A smaller lake also in Lombardy and the perfect stop to stretch our legs and have a lunch break before reaching Lake Iseo.
Lake Iseo
Views to Mont Isola at the island of Lake Iseo were breathtaking so we decided to stay here for the night.
Hiking trails connecting very small ancient villages, old churches, and olive fields with sheep and donkeys.
Lake Garda
Lazise
Bardolino and Malcesine
Riva del Garda
Famous for its beaches, swimming, sailing, windsurfing, hiking and cycling holidays. Here you can paraglide too.

Italy is an extraordinary country that blends history, art, culture, cuisine, and natural beauty in an unparalleled manner. From its ancient ruins to its vibrant cities and picturesque landscapes, Italy has captivated the hearts of millions. In this article, we will explore the various aspects that make Italy unique, from its rich history to its diverse regional offerings.
Italy is often called the birthplace of Western civilization. The ruins of ancient Rome, providing remnants of its powerful empire, speak to its historical significance. The Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon are not just tourist attractions; they are testaments to a bygone era that shaped architecture, governance, and law in many parts of the world.
The Renaissance period flourished in Italy, primarily in cities like Florence, Venice, and Milan. This cultural movement saw the emergence of remarkable artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, whose works have left an indelible mark on art and culture globally. The legacy of the Renaissance continues to influence modern design, art, and literature.
Italy boasts an astronomical number of art treasures. The Vatican Museums, showcasing works by Raphael and Michelangelo, are one of the most visited destinations in the world. Additionally, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence houses masterpieces from the likes of Botticelli and Titian. The sheer volume of artistic genius within Italy’s borders is unmatched.
Italy’s architecture is as diverse as its regions. The iconic Leaning Tower of Pisa, the intricate Gothic facades of Milan Cathedral, and the romantic canals of Venice star in the country’s architectural repertoire. Furthermore, the charm of small medieval towns, with their cobbled streets and historic buildings, add to Italy’s architectural allure.
Italian cuisine is celebrated worldwide, but what makes it distinctively unique is its regional diversity. From the rich risottos of Northern Italy to the fresh seafood of the Amalfi Coast, each region offers unique flavors and traditions. Dishes like pizza, pasta, and gelato have their roots in specific locales, showcasing the country’s culinary heritage.
Italian culinary excellence is tied to its commitment to high-quality, local ingredients. Olive oil, fresh vegetables, cheeses, and meats play a crucial role in traditional dishes. The Mediterranean lifestyle, which is intrinsic to Italian culture, emphasizes a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, promoting wellness and enjoyment of food.
Italy’s landscapes are incredibly varied. From the rolling hills of Tuscany, adorned with vineyards and olive groves, to the stunning cliffs of the Amalfi Coast, the country’s natural beauty is breathtaking. The Dolomites in the North attract outdoor enthusiasts with their rugged peaks, while the serene beaches in Sardinia offer a slice of paradise.
Italy is home to the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world, with over 58 sites. This includes the picturesque landscapes of the Cinque Terre, the historical and architectural wonders of Venice, and the cultural landscapes of the Val d’Orcia. Each site tells a story of the intertwined relationship between nature and human creativity.
Italy’s cultural calendar is sprinkled with festivals that showcase the nation’s heritage and local traditions. Events such as Carnevale in Venice and the Palio di Siena draw crowds with lively parades, colorful costumes, and thrilling horse races. These festivals provide insight into the local way of life, uniting communities in shared joy and celebration.
Italian culture places a strong emphasis on family and community. Meals are often shared events, where multiple generations gather to enjoy traditional dishes. This communal spirit fosters a sense of belonging and reinforces the importance of relationships in everyday life.
Italian is often considered one of the most beautiful languages in the world. Its melodic tones and expressive vocabulary contribute to its uniqueness. The language is also a significant part of Italy’s identity, with numerous dialects reflecting the rich diversity of various regions.
Italy has a rich literary tradition, with significant contributions from authors such as Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Umberto Eco. The literary works originating from Italy often explore themes of love, philosophy, and human experience, reflecting the nation’s diverse cultural heritage.
Italy is synonymous with high fashion. Cities like Milan are considered global fashion capitals, housing revered designers such as Valentino, Prada, and Gucci. The Milan Fashion Week is a pivotal event in the fashion industry, showcasing cutting-edge designs and trends.
Beyond fashion, Italian design is celebrated in industries such as automotive (Ferrari, Maserati), furniture, and architecture. Italian designers prioritize functionality while maintaining a strong emphasis on aesthetics, leading to innovative and timeless creations.
Some of the top tourist destinations include Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, and the Amalfi Coast. Each of these locations offers unique attractions, historical landmarks, and cultural experiences.
The best time to visit is typically during the spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) when the weather is pleasant, and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak summer months.
It is advisable to dress smartly in Italy, especially when dining out or attending religious sites. Comfortable walking shoes are also essential for exploring cities and towns.
Must-try dishes include pizza Napoletana, pasta carbonara, risotto alla Milanese, and gelato. Each region has its specialties, so be sure to explore local cuisines.
Overall, Italy is considered a safe country for tourists. However, it’s wise to stay vigilant and take standard precautions against pickpockets, especially in crowded areas.
Italy’s unique blend of history, culture, cuisine, and stunning landscapes continues to inspire travelers from all over the world. The country’s rich tapestry makes it not only a destination but also a profoundly dynamic experience that lingers in the hearts and minds of those who visit.

Italy is a beautiful country, full of history, culture, and delicious food. But what if I told you that you can explore and enjoy this country to the fullest without compromising on your lifestyle as a digital nomad? As someone who has stayed in over 2000 hotels across Italy, I specialize in finding mid-range accommodations with a budget of €60–110 per night, focusing on 3 or 4-star hotels. My experience has taught me to strike a balance between comfort and cost, making the most out of each stay without going to extremes.
In this article, I’ll share with you some of the best tips and tricks I’ve learned along the way. But this is just the beginning! Throughout this series, we’ll go beyond the basics of “where to stay” and “what to eat,” diving into the practicalities of living well on the road: how to maximize your experience, find hidden gems, and maintain a high quality of life that goes beyond mere survival.
Who Am I?
I’m a digital nomad with a unique perspective. I work as a technical consultant for a multinational company, splitting my time between freelance projects and a steady job that takes me all over Italy — and sometimes beyond. Because of my work, I’m always on the move, and I’ve made it my mission to find the best places to live, eat, and work remotely, no matter where I am.
But unlike some digital nomads, I’m not willing to live like a “poor man” nomad, squeezing myself into the cheapest hostels and cutting corners just to get by. I also refuse to become a “digital hermit,” living in isolation away from the pulse of the cities. Instead, I aim to thrive — finding a balance between comfort, productivity, and enjoyment. And that’s what I want to share with you in this series.
What Does It Cost to Travel Well in Italy?
Let’s start with the basics: What does it cost to travel well in Italy? I’m not talking about scraping by on a tight budget. I’m talking about a lifestyle that includes good food, nice hotels, and experiences that leave you feeling fulfilled.
How to Travel Around Italy Efficiently
Italy’s public transportation system is good, but knowing how to navigate it can save you a lot of time and stress. However, unlike many digital nomads, I don’t often find myself traveling between big cities like Rome and Milan, where trains are ideal, or from Rome to Catania, where a plane would be the obvious choice.
Why and when Traveling by Car is Essential in Italy
Unlike in many other countries, my job rarely takes me to the major hubs like Rome or Milan, where trains and planes would be the most practical options. Instead, I travel to small towns and villages off the beaten path — places that are hard to reach by public transportation. If you’re in a similar line of work, it’s crucial to understand that the car becomes your lifeline.
Driving in Italy is not only a practical necessity but also a way to fully experience the country. Italy is densely populated and full of charming towns and villages that are worth exploring. Driving to get your groceries or grabbing a beer in a small village becomes an unparalleled experience!
Given the layout and structure of Italian towns, unless you want to be a “caravan nomad” moving with public transportation, a car is essential. And if you enjoy driving as much as I do, it’s an experience to cherish rather than a burden. Italy is not like Spain, where cities are spread out and public transport is a more viable option. Here, the car is strategic. I’ll share with you some tips on how to make the most of it and save money while you’re at it.
Tips for Enjoying Your Hotel Stays
One of the perks of my job is staying in a wide variety of hotels. Whether it’s a 5-star luxury resort or a small boutique hotel in a hidden village, I’ve learned a few tricks to make every stay more enjoyable:
The Joy of Exploring Small Towns in Italy
One of the true joys of traveling around Italy is exploring its many small towns and villages. Every region has its own charm, and the people are often warm and welcoming. The best part? Even in the most remote locations, you’ll rarely feel isolated. Unlike in some other countries, where you can feel like a stranger in the countryside, in Italy you’re more likely to be invited to a local event or to share a meal.
This is why you’ll never feel like a “digital hermit” in Italy — unless you choose to be. The density of the towns and the hospitality of the people make it easy to connect, network, and create meaningful experiences, no matter where you are.
Wrapping It Up
Italy has so much to offer, and it’s possible to experience it all without compromising on quality. This is just the beginning of a series of articles where I’ll explore various Italian and European destinations, sharing what it truly means to live well as a digital nomad.
Stay tuned for more articles where I’ll dive deeper into specific cities and regions, sharing hidden gems, recommended hotels, and, of course, the best places to eat. Because living like a digital nomad shouldn’t be about “making do” — it should be about living well.

Touching down in Italy for the first time was simply magical. The warm Mediterranean breeze greeted me as I stepped off the plane, carrying with it tantalizing hints of freshly baked pizza and rich espresso. My senses were immediately awakened by the vibrant hues of the landscape and the animated chatter in melodic Italian. Rome’s bustling street life unfurled before me with scooter-filled alleyways, ancient ruins peeking around burgeoning modernity, and lively piazzas brimming with locals and tourists alike. It was here, while savoring a creamy gelato beside the majestic Colosseum, that I first fell in love with Italy’s intoxicating blend of history and contemporary charm.
Wandering through Italy’s cities revealed a tapestry of experiences that surpassed all my expectations. From the romantic canals of Venice to the artistic fervor of Florence, and the fashion-forward streets of Milan, each city possessed its own unique character and allure. The locals’ warm hospitality made me feel like I was welcomed into a large, extended family, eager to share their rich cultural heritage. I was captivated by the seamless way ancient monuments coexisted with modern conveniences, creating urban landscapes that felt both timeless and vibrant. What truly surprised me was how every corner of Italy offered something different; a culinary delight, a hidden historical gem, or a breathtaking view that left me in awe.
Italy’s cities are like a playground for the curious traveler, each offering a distinct set of adventures waiting to be discovered. Join me as we delve into the top 10 must-visit cities across this enchanting country. Buckle up for a journey through Italy’s urban gems, where history whispers through cobblestone streets and modernity pulses through lively markets and trendy cafes.
Although the post describes 10 experiences in , Italy, you can explore 2947 experiences in , as well as thousands of other cities across the globe on Travel Ninja. Watch the video below for more information, and download the app at Travel Ninja.
Stepping off the plane in Rome felt like diving into a living, breathing history lesson drenched in vibrant modernity. The first thing that struck me was the timeless grandeur of the architecture — ancient ruins stood majestically beside chic boutiques and lively cafes. As I strolled through the bustling streets, I encountered a fascinating blend of people: tourists eagerly snapping photos at the Colosseum, locals animatedly chatting in small piazzas, and street performers adding an artistic flair to the atmosphere. The hum of scooters zipping by and the welcoming aroma of freshly baked pizza were a sensory delight. I managed my expenses well, finding accommodations in a charming mid-range B&B for around €80 a night and enjoying delicious meals for approximately €10-€20 per meal.
During an early morning exploration, the usually crowded Trevi Fountain was serene and almost ethereal in the soft dawn light. It was then that I met a couple from Argentina, and we shared our travel stories over espresso, marveling at the fusion of Rome’s ancient roots with its contemporary vibe. The energy shifted noticeably during the off-hours; the city seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, offering a more intimate glimpse into its heart. This visit made me appreciate how Rome thrives on its contrasts — tradition and modernity, hustle and tranquility — all of which are seamlessly woven together in its cultural tapestry. This immersion deepened my admiration for the city and gave me a richer understanding of its unique social fabric.
Exploring Venice felt like stepping into a living painting. The narrow, winding streets blend seamlessly with majestic canals, buzzing with vaporettos and gondolas. At every corner, there’s a mix of excited tourists and locals casually sipping espressos or chatting in lilting Italian. With a budget of €50 a day, I savored delicious cicchetti at vibrant bacari, sipping Spritz Aperol and marveling over Saint Mark’s Basilica’s intricate mosaics. The blend of ancient architecture and contemporary life is stunning. Venice is both a historical marvel and a hub of modern energy.
Dawn strolls across the Rialto Bridge, practically deserted, offered me quiet moments to soak in the serene beauty. One delightful incident involved a cheerful American couple who, upon sharing their map, eagerly guided me to the lesser-known Fondaco dei Tedeschi terrace. We debated the best gelato flavors while marveling at the panoramic view. Interactions like these made me realize how Venice serves as a meeting point of cultures, fostering camaraderie among strangers. The trip deepened my appreciation for how Venetians preserve their rich heritage while embracing the cosmopolitan vibe — it’s a city where tradition beautifully dances with modernity. Can’t wait for your stories!
Upon arriving in Florence, the city greeted me with an intoxicating mix of history and vibrant modern life. The cobblestone streets whispered tales of the Renaissance as Vespa scooters buzzed by, creating a lively, eclectic atmosphere. Walking towards the heart of the city, I marveled at the grandeur of the Duomo, its pink and green marble facade glistening in the sunlight. The bustling Piazza della Signoria was a feast for the senses — gelato shops with their rainbow assortments, the grandeur of Palazzo Vecchio, and street musicians playing classical melodies. With my stepping counter enthusiastically tallying more than 15,000 steps, I felt every euro spent was worth it — entrance fees to museums (€15–20 each) and delicious meals at cozy trattorias (€10–15 per meal).
As evening fell, the city transformed into a romantically lit wonderland. Less crowded now, I wandered along the banks of the Arno River, the Ponte Vecchio glowing under the streetlights. I struck up a conversation with a couple from Brazil at a quaint wine bar, and we swapped travel stories over a glass of Chianti (€5). The blend of tradition met modernity beautifully here, from historic architecture to chic boutiques. This juxtaposition deepened my appreciation for the city’s dynamic character. Florence isn’t just a relic of the past; it’s a living, breathing city, full of creativity and life. My experience was an eye-opener to the cultural depth of Florence, where each encounter, be it with locals or fellow travelers, is a brushstroke in a rich, colorful canvas.
Walking through Milan feels like stepping into a living blend of history and modernity. My visit began at the awe-inspiring Duomo di Milano, a gothic cathedral that pierced the sky with its spires. As I marveled at its intricate facades, the bustling Piazza del Duomo spread before me, where chic locals mingled with eager tourists. The energy was palpable, with street performers adding to the vibrant ambiance. For a reasonable 10 euros, I ascended to the rooftop, where the city’s panorama offered glimpses of both medieval structures and contemporary skyscrapers. I’ve never felt such a unique blend of past and present.
Exploring the streets, I encountered high-end fashion boutiques nestled beside centuries-old cafes, symbolizing Milan’s knack for harmonizing tradition with the avant-garde. An evening aperitivo in the Navigli district was an unforgettable experience — think canal-side bars with a backdrop of golden sunsets, a spread of delicious appetizers for just 12 euros, and lively conversations with fellow travelers from all over the world. I exchanged stories with an architect from Tokyo who came to Milan to study its renowned design styles. These interactions and the city’s dynamic atmosphere deepened my appreciation for Milan’s role as a global cultural hub. Even during the quieter hours, the city’s spirit remained vibrant, resonating with the whispers of history intertwined with the buzz of contemporary life.
Naples, ah, what an unforgettable adventure it was! Stepping off the train, the city welcomed me with its vibrant and bustling energy. The air felt electric, rich with the smell of fresh pizza wafting through narrow, cobblestone streets lined with Vespas and ancient buildings, effortlessly blending the old with the new. I found myself among a varied crowd — from stylishly dressed locals to backpacking tourists, all contributing to a chaotic, yet harmonious atmosphere. A slice of authentic Margherita pizza cost me a modest 4 euros and was worth every penny. As I meandered through the cities alleyways, I stumbled upon an impromptu street performance that turned a casual evening into a lively, shared experience, underscoring Naples’ vibrant social culture.
During quieter moments, like early mornings before the city fully awakes, I could almost hear the whispers of history amidst the stillness. Walking along the waterfront, with Mount Vesuvius majestically framing the skyline, I felt a mixture of awe and peace. An encounter with a friendly fellow traveler at a small, family-run café led to an intriguing conversation about Naples’ transformation over the years. Their insights into the juxtaposition of the city’s time-honored traditions with modern flair deepened my appreciation for Naples’ unique character — a city where past and present coexist in perfect symphony. Whether exploring the ancient ruins of Pompeii just a train ride away, or marveling at contemporary street art, Naples enchanted me with its seamless blend of history, culture, and vitality.
Stepping into Amalfi felt like walking straight into a living postcard. Nestled between the rugged cliffs and cerulean waters, the town exudes both nostalgia and vibrant energy. The atmosphere was intoxicating — sun-drenched piazzas brimming with locals and tourists alike, mingling as the scent of fresh lemon groves wafted through the air. With a budget of around €120 per day, I managed to grab gelato on the bustling main street and watched as couples and families chatter animatedly over espresso at sidewalk cafes. The quaint shops boasted everything from hand-painted ceramics to luxurious silk scarves, standing as a testament to Amalfi’s seamless blend of tradition with modern splendor.
Despite the lively crowds, there were tranquil moments during the early morning and late afternoon. Wandering through the narrow alleyways when they were almost deserted, I felt an intimate connection to the soul of the town. An elder local, noticing my curiosity about the stunning Duomo di Sant’Andrea, shared tales of the cathedral’s storied past, enriching my appreciation for its architectural grandeur. As evening fell, I joined a group of fellow travelers at a small trattoria where we feasted on fresh seafood and homemade pasta for less than €30 each. Our conversations flowed effortlessly, bridging diverse backgrounds and languages. This encounter illuminated Amalfi’s unique charm — a place where time-honored traditions coexist with the thriving pulse of contemporary life, fostering a deep sense of belonging and community. My visit wasn’t just a trip; it was a gateway to understanding the rich, multifaceted culture of Amalfi.
Stepping off the train at Sorrento felt like walking into a sun-drenched painting. The narrow streets burst with vibrant colors — blue and yellow tiles lining the walls, vivid bougainvillea spilling over canopies. The air was a divine blend of citrus and sea salt, creating an intoxicating atmosphere that was both grounding and exhilarating. I strolled along the bustling Piazza Tasso, where locals and tourists melded in a lively dance of conversation. For just about 15 Euros, I enjoyed the creamiest gelato as I soaked in the scene — a symphony of clinking glasses, laughing children, and the occasional Vespa zipping by. The town harmonizes timeworn traditions with modern charm effortlessly, from ancient architecture to chic cafes.
Off-hours revealed a quieter, more contemplative side of Sorrento. Early mornings were my favorite, as I wandered the virtually empty Marina Grande. The fishermen were returning with their catch, exchanging hearty greetings in musical Neapolitan dialects. A friendly local named Marco invited me to join a small group savoring freshly-cooked seafood — free of charge! His stories of Sorrento’s history deepened my appreciation for the town’s timeless energy. Interacting with other visitors from around the globe, I relished discussions that ranged from travel tips to cultural insights. This unexpected camaraderie made me realize how Sorrento is not just a destination but a confluence of life, tradition, and modern pleasures that bring people together.
Walking through the cobblestone streets of Verona, the city feels alive with history and a touch of romantic whimsy. The air is filled with the soft hum of conversation, a symphony of Italian laced with laughter and the clang of espresso cups at corner cafes. The first thing that captures my attention is the Arena di Verona, an ancient Roman amphitheater that stands testament to both Verona’s past and its vibrant present as it still hosts operas and concerts. With a budget of around €30 for a guided tour and another €15 for a cappuccino and pastry at a charming café, I felt like I was living in a dream. The blend of medieval architecture with chic boutiques and restaurants painted a vivid contrast of tradition and modernity.
As the evening sun dipped below the horizon, I wandered into a quaint piazza where locals gathered for aperitivo. The mix of people — from elderly couples to young professionals and curious tourists like myself — added a rich tapestry of stories and energy. Striking up a conversation with a fellow traveler from Brazil, we shared thoughts on Juliet’s House and whether touching her statue really brings love luck. As the night deepened, so did my appreciation for Verona’s fusion of past and present; its traditional roots were palpable even as the city embraced a contemporary, globalized spirit. This visit wasn’t just a sightseeing trip; it was a soulful dive into a culture that balances heritage and modernity with grace and flair. If you’re planning your trip, set aside some time to simply absorb and enjoy Verona’s unique vibe.
Walking through the charming streets of Bologna, I felt like I had stepped into a living, breathing museum. The terracotta-roofed buildings, medieval towers, and long porticoes painting a fascinating blend of the old and new. The energy was palpable as locals darted through Piazza Maggiore on their morning errands while tourists marveled at the Basilica di San Petronio. I joined in, exploring on foot, and ended up having an impromptu coffee chat with a group of friendly university students. They introduced me to the best gelato in town, costing only €2.50, and shared stories of studying in this historic yet dynamic city.
As the day turned into night, Bologna transformed. The streets bustled with an eclectic mix of people — young professionals unwinding after work, street performers enchanting passersby, and elderly couples strolling hand in hand. Dinner at a local trattoria, where I spent about €15 for a plate of tagliatelle al ragù, was an absolute delight. It was here that I met a Dutch couple who were on a culinary tour of Italy. Our lively conversation about Bolognese traditions versus their modern aspirations gave me a deeper appreciation for Bologna’s unique character. By the late evening, as the city quieted down, I appreciated the serene yet lively ambiance that made Bologna feel like a timeless gem waiting to be discovered over and over again.
Imagine stepping into a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors and intoxicating sounds as you walk through the bustling streets of Palermo. The aroma of freshly baked sfincione — a local-style pizza — mingles with the scent of citrus from the vendors at the Ballarò Market. With a modest budget of €50 a day, I indulged in street food, savored an espresso at an alfresco café, and soaked up the local atmosphere. The streets were a lively mix of tourists and locals, each bringing their unique flair to the city’s intricate mosaic. The chatter in various dialects, combined with the honking of scooters zipping through narrow alleys, created a symphony that was quintessentially Palermo.
By evening, the city transitioned into a different rhythm. The grand Teatro Massimo was serenely lit, casting a majestic glow over the piazza. I met a fellow traveler from Argentina, and we shared our awe over Palermo’s confluence of ancient history and modern vitality. Wandering through the charming streets after hours, I marveled at how the city retained its old-world charm amidst modern cafes and boutiques. This visit truly deepened my appreciation for Palermo’s unique blend of tradition and innovation, making it a city that’s as timeless as it is contemporary. If you’re planning to visit, do spend an evening chatting with locals to fully savor this rich cultural tapestry.

Buongiorno! One of my favourite countries in this world? Italy! Pizza, pasta, and wine in masses, all under the dry heat of the sun with some of the most lovely people on earth.
This is one of my favourite places on earth, hands down. It is the kind of Tuscan village you see in movies and on postcards. Driving there on the street with cypress trees on both sides takes you back in time. Yes, this village is a little touristy but it is gorgeous and when in Tuscany, you need to go here. Nestled in green nature near the Mediterranean Sea you can find small restaurants, cafes, gelato, interior decor shops, wine and Italian specialities, it has everything your touristy Italian heart could ever desire. Go to the cafe in the middle of the town and treat yourself to an Espresso con Coretto (or with Grappa, they have both) with some Cantuccini or pastry of choice. Get lovely Ice Cream (the Bolgheri flavour is mouth-watering). Take a little sniff at the room perfumes in the interior store left from the gate.

This article was originally published in Spanish and you are invited to read it as well in my beautiful language here
I am not a psychologist. I could read a bunch of books to find answers to questions like why we enjoy dreaming, and why we love idealizing places, people, and situations… but I’m too lazy to do that.
All I know is that if you idealize your life, it’s probably because you like living in a self-generated Matrix avoiding some problem, denying it, or worse, you’ve always lived that way.
Nowadays, however, we have a huge choice of online resources, and it’s possible to get a real sense of what a place might be like: ideal for living or vacationing, boring or lively, safe or dangerous. You have the chance to even interact with its inhabitants long distance or, simply ask travelers about their experiences.
A few months ago a video of a girl went viral because she was complaining about how to get to Amalfi. She said she had to fly to Naples, take a train to Sorrento, a ferry to Amalfi, and finally climb lots of stairs to reach her hotel — all this in the height of summer, with that heat! Can you believe it?
She said influencers should be jailed for saying things that aren’t true… (deep breath…)
Here’s the thing: living is easy with eyes closed, but today you don’t have excuses. You have to be in the here and now. Whether it’s Instagram, YouTube, a book, or an article, you must remember that someone’s version of a place or an experience is subjective and probably idealized. You need to be aware that what you’re being sold on social media is either driven by economic convenience or because the person in question is feeding their delusion, trying to rope others into their fantasy.
You can’t plan your vacations, your life, or your career based on the ideas others give you. You have to go out into the world, connect with people, try, smell, ask, think critically, question, and then decide what to think, how to act, what to do, and where to go.
Mistakes are always lurking around the corner — you should always keep that in mind — but I can assure you that you’ll feel less frustrated knowing that you did everything yourself and consciously made the effort for your project to succeed.
Having said all this, I imagine you now understand why I said “No” in response to the title of this article.
But maybe I’m not so good at explaining my thesis, so here it is:
No, it’s not beautiful in Italy or anywhere else if you’ve decided to see life through filters, through the eyes of others — call them dream sellers, rich kids who study or live abroad, or immigrants who haven’t adapted to a new lifestyle or who’ve endured years of bitterness before achieving a decent standard of living and showing it off to you.
Life is beautiful only when you look at it with your own eyes and your ideas. It’s beautiful with both the good and the bad — not just when you see it through the Deep Summer filter.
Wake up!

This is the third time in my life that I have been a tourist. The first time was in 1975 when I was traveling with a guy, and he was a tourist. I had hitched a ride, and he wanted to see the Eifel Tower, Notre Dame and the cathedral in Cologne. He also wanted to eat pastries — I found it bizarre. We parted company, and I found another ride. Thankfully, it was less than a week.
The second time was with my daughter last December when we went to Valencia together. We had (and have) very different ideas of what travel means. For me, it means skipping all the tourist places, wondering around the streets with a camera — walking for many miles each day, just looking at the buildings and the people. For my daughter, it means going to museums and other tourist attractions. For her, it mean eating in restaurants to try out new tastes. For me, it means going to the grocers, buying tinned sardines, a bread roll, and keeping food cheap and healthy. I’ve no interest in eating out.
And then there’s now.
Each January, there are travel sales. Ryanair was offering return tickets to Rome for €30. I thought I would take advantage of that, although I’ve never had the slightest interest in either Rome or Italy. As a…

I took a three-day trip to Italy on New Years. It was always my dream to visit the great Ancient Rome, so you can imagine how excited I was for this trip. Throughout my visit, I experienced some wonderful places, great food, and met new people. I want to share with you the rookie mistakes that I made, the things I did right, and ultimately what I learned from this experience. Here are some tips for navigating your way through the beautiful city of Rome.
Pack well (and right!!): Extra clothes, check, portable charger, check, type C, F, and L power outlet plugs, not check. Seriously, I spent the first half of my day there looking for electronic stores with the correct power outlet adapters. I made a rookie mistake, and hopefully, you will not have to.
Don’t pay extra. If anyone tries to convince you that you have to pay to get into the Vatican, I will assure you that you don’t. As soon as I arrived at the Vatican, I was unpleasantly approached by a man who apparently had only two tickets left to sell for the Vatican. Most might think that they “got lucky” and that they had just made it there in time before tickets were sold out, but that isn’t the case at all. Just keep your head up and walk right into the Vatican. It’s free. Thankfully, binge-watching travel videos on youtube helped me with that one.
Take lots of pictures. If you are traveling along, you can even ask tourists to take photos of you! As a solo traveler, I had plenty of time to soak in all the views and take my time appreciating all the sights and wonders. It is nice to take some pictures so you can reminisce later (who knows when you’ll be back). If you want to take some pictures of yourself, ask tourists if they’d be willing to take it for you, you’d be surprised how much photography talent there is in the crowd. If you see someone who could use a hand, offer to help them take their picture, they might offer to take yours back. Well, hey, it worked for me.
Plan well! I packed my day with wonderful sightseeing adventures and activities. It is crucial to check openings of the different places, especially on holidays. Unfortunately, I missed out on the great opportunity of seeing the Sistine Chapel because it was closed on the new year.
Throw a coin (or two) into the Trevi Garden. Legend has it that if you throw a coin over your head into the Trevi Fountain, chances are, you will return to Rome. If you throw two, you will return to Rome and fall in love, and three, you will return to Rome, fall in love, and get married there. I don’t know if this has been proven correct, but it can’t hurt to take your chances either way. Unluckily, I didn’t get to throw coins into the fountain, but have no doubt; I shall return.
Check out what Italy is known for, then make sure not to miss out. I enjoyed some delicious Italian Ice Cream, Pizza, and House Wine. The wine is incredibly affordable in Italy. While in the restaurant, don’t rush to receive the bill. It is customary in Italy to stick around and have a conversation after a nice meal.
Fly Ryanair! This one is a little bit controversial. If you asked me then if I would fly Ryanair again, I would have said that I would absolutely not. Looking back though, I realize how convenient it was to have a cheap flight from London to Rome. Just make sure you read exactly what you need to do when buying the ticket so they won’t charge you extra for late check-in or carry-on bags. If you don’t want to experience flight delays though, don’t fly with Ryanair. They might have cheaper flights, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost.
I hope asome of these travelling tips helped you out! I know that I need to take some of my own advice on my next trip to Rome.
Edit: This blog is a repost from 3 years ago when I first visited Rome. Hope you enjoy!

“Why are there so many tourist scammers? In the EU? How is that possible?!” I find myself pondering as I sit on a bench at Capitoline Hill in Rome, having just dismissed the fifth “salesman” hawking water/hats/bracelets/ whatever in the span of ten minutes. Perhaps equally surprising is the police who keep a few meters away but do not intervene.
“Consider this — by selling three bracelets they have an average hourly rate that could rival a much harder job in Glovo or something,” remarks my boyfriend having recently engaged in a lively argument with a guy offering him an African souvenir for free, which later suddenly appeared to cost “at least something”.
“But it’s illegal! It’s immoral! Do they have any respect for Italian culture? Or to humans at all? I simply couldn’t look up to the Colosseum because another guy f****d my mind forcing us to buy a ticket for the hop-on-hop-off bus!” I exclaim, my emotions getting the better of me. However, the worst was their pre-prepared reaction to every answer to the question “Where are you from?” My bad, I replied I was from Ukraine — and then they transformed the historic “Slava Ukraini” (“Glory to Ukraine”) into a cheap plea for me to…

When I think about Italy, I think about a place I never ever want to leave. It reminds me of places in Disney I dreamed of as a young girl, hoping my dashing prince in a dazzling amour would steal me away to, and we would ride into beautiful lands, under the soothing breeze in the evening sun. I asked a friend how he would describe how Italy makes him feel, and he said “Romance. A date night in Venice driving an expensive car wearing a white shirt and having on good perfume and her wearing a sundress and red lipstick”.
We all have our various descriptions of how Italy makes us feel. One thing we would all agree on is that Italy is a place where our dreams come alive!
When I think of Italy I think of peace, beauty, and history. It’s not just a country, it’s an experience, a lifestyle, it’s an unending sweet memory for everyone who gets a taste of “la dolce vita”.
REASONS WHY ITALY HAS OUR HEARTS
La Dolce Vita
This translates to English “The sweet life”. This embodies a lifestyle that is the core of Italy’s identity. It’s more than just a saying, it’s a philosophy, an attitude, and an outlook on life that makes even the mundane aspects of life fulfilling. It is a lifestyle that enjoys the sweetness of life, its pleasures, slow leisures, relaxations, and the finest things it offers. After the popular film of the 1960s la Dolce Vita by the outstanding director Federico Fellini, this phrase became a popular phrase attached to the country. In its broadest sense, “la dolce vita” is about savoring life — enjoying good food, company, and the beauty of the world around us. It’s about finding joy in the small, everyday moments, whether it’s a leisurely meal with friends, a walk through a sunlit city street, or enjoying a glass of wine at sunset. The phrase encapsulates a spirit of hedonism, but it’s not necessarily about excess; rather, it’s about balance — taking the time to appreciate life’s sensory pleasures. The ease of this lifestyle is why every single person desires to attach themselves to the luxury of this idea.
Art
Italy is considered one of the birthplaces of western art, giving expression to one of the most celebrated artists in human history, the most fascinating architectural wonders throughout the world hailing from its origin. From the ruins of ancient Rome to the modern art galleries of Milan, Italy’s rich artistic heritage, its art continues to evolve, influencing and shaping global art for centuries. Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome became the cultural epicenters of Europe, drawing innumerable people to the awe of its rich beauty. So many people come to Italy and all they can take away from these cities is the depth of thoughtfulness, talent, creativity, and genius that produces such great art. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci with Monalisa, and Michelangelo Buonarroti, known for his sculpture David and his work on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which remains one of the most revered artistic achievements in history. From the roadside views to the elaborate museum, Italy is the home of art. We will forever love it!
Food
If there’s anything Italy is associated with it’s the many delicacies it offers. It is a country where cuisine is not merely about nutritional sustenance but a reflection of the country’s history, culture, and regional diversity. Italian food is celebrated globally for its simplicity, flavor, and use of high-quality, fresh ingredients. Food in Italy is more than a meal; it’s an integral part of the Italian way of life, a social experience, and a manifestation of family, tradition, and place. From the rich pasta dishes of the south to the taste-fulfilling risottos of the north, and creamy pizza from Naples, you’ll find rich, hearty dishes like lasagna, tortellini, and bolognese sauce a delight. From Rome to southern Italy, to Milan and all its beautiful cities, each of them comes with its specialties, curated with expertise and care. Food in Italy is an expression of love, pride, and tradition. Italian families often pass down recipes from generation to generation, and meals are a time for bringing people together. Whether in a bustling trattoria, a family kitchen, or a high-end restaurant, food is central to Italian life, fostering community and connection. Many Italian celebrations — such as Christmas, Easter, and regional festivals — are marked by elaborate feasts that showcase the country’s diverse culinary heritage. This is why we love Italy
Natural and Man-made Awes
Italy isn’t just known for its art, food, and lifestyle, it’s blessed with the most gorgeous nature, with stunning landscapes the snow-capped peaks of the Alps in the north to the golden beaches of the Mediterranean coast, and the historic architecture that graces its cities and towns, Italy’s natural beauty and man-made structures continue to top the world’s most popular tourist attractions. Italy’s varied topography is dominated by mountain ranges, with some of the most dramatic peaks in Europe. These mountains offer breathtaking views and a wide range of outdoor activities, like skiing, hiking, and mountaineering.Italy’s coastline stretches for more than 7,000 kilometers, offering some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe.
The glistening shores of the Amalfi Coast and the pristine sands of Sardinia are its main locations. The country’s beaches cater to every taste — whether you’re seeking luxury resorts, charming coastal villages, or quiet, hidden coves.
Last but not least, the Italian architecture is renowned for its rich history, artistic expression, and innovative design, influencing architectural styles around the world for centuries. From ancient Roman engineering feats to modern design movements, Italy has been a cradle for groundbreaking ideas in architecture. The foundation of Italian architecture can be traced to ancient Rome, where monumental structures like the Colosseum, Pantheon, and Roman Forum showcased the mastery of arches, vaults, and concrete construction. Romans perfected the use of concrete, allowing them to build large-scale structures with unprecedented durability and grandeur. We know so well that Italy’s beauty will continue to transcend time and generations just as it always has.
Love & Romance
Italy is often synonymous with love and romance, a country where passion is its culture and history. With romantic cities to its art, literature, and food, Italy has long been a symbol of romance, drawing couples from around the world to experience the magic of its cities and countryside. Many of Italy’s cities have a natural allure for lovers. Venice, with its winding canals and romantic gondola rides, is perhaps the most famous destination for romance. The city’s dreamy atmosphere, with its ancient palaces, narrow alleys, and bridges like the Rialto and the Bridge of Sighs, evokes a sense of timeless love. The Gondola ride along the canals remains one of the most iconic romantic experiences.
The floating city Florence, birthplace of the Renaissance, is another city that captured the hearts of lovers. Its art, architecture, and breathtaking views like Piazzale Michelangelo or the top of the Duomo are perfect settings for romance. Florence also hosts the Vasari Corridor, a hidden passage that once connected the offices of the ruling Medici family with their private palace, offering an air of mystery and history for lovers to explore. With movies, music, and tales that show us Italy’s beautiful love and romance in our everyday world, like my friend when saying he thinks of Italy, he thinks Romance, it’s the same for millions around the globe, It’s a universal feeling.
Culture
Italian culture is one of the richest, most diverse, and influential in the world. Its long history, shaped by ancient civilizations, the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, and centuries of regional traditions, has given Italy a unique cultural identity that continues to resonate globally. Italian culture blends art, music, cuisine, fashion, architecture, and family life into a living celebration of beauty, passion, and creativity. Italy is renowned as the origin of some of the world’s most important art movements, including the Renaissance, which emerged in the 14th century and reached its peak in the 16th century. The works of artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian still stand as monumental achievements in the history of Western art. Italy is home to countless masterpieces housed in museums, churches, and palaces. With its people who are warm and receptive to strangers on travel explores, to the rich language, and festivals of its several descents, Italy’s depth and cultural diversity cannot be ignored.
There are so many reasons to love Italy and these are a few. When we think about Italy our hearts burst with excitement and longing for the experiences it gives us! Italy is such a great country and its greatness is still waiting to be discovered!

One cannot really experience a true immersion in a place during a 1–2 week vacation, it takes time to go beyond stereotypes and shallow ideas about a nation and culture. My family and I spent all of June and July of this year in Northern Italy, from Milan we explored as far West as Sardegna, as far East as Venice, as far South as Siena (Tuscany) and a dozen places in between.
This is my home country, I was born in the Italian Alps and left for America at age 11 — just before the language centers of the pre-adolescent brain fully develop. It is for this reason (thankfully) that my English lacks that distinct Italian accent. I speak Italian as a native speaker (someone who has learned the language in its country) so my immersion in this place is quite a bit more than what a typical American would experience. I am atypical.
This allowed for a much deeper experience, for obvious reasons. Unnecessary are the countless events where one is fumbling around for a word or a basic understanding. The cultural differences are substantial enough without a language barrier and a language is a fundamental part of a culture.

I spent a considerable amount of time in Italy, forming friendships with both locals and people from various parts of the world, both within and outside the European Union. While Italy has a fascinating culture and beautiful architecture that many people admire, I have some reasons why I didn’t choose to live there permanently. I want to share these reasons to help others make informed decisions if they’re thinking about moving to Italy.
Here are the main reasons I decided not to make Italy my permanent home.

Italy is not just a destination — it’s a journey through centuries of art, passion, and flavor, where every corner tells a story and every meal is a celebration.
I have been in Germany for almost a year as a medical Ph.D. student. This is the first time for me to travel in Europe except for Germany and to my pleasure, Italy is the first country I visit here. So it’s a good time to tell you about my recent life here.
Our routines are as follows:
City №1: Milan
City №2: Venice
City №3: Florence
City №4: Pisa
City №5: Rome
Place №6: Vantican
Milan Catheral (Duomo di Milano)
I stood in front of the Milan Cathedral, completely captivated — its delicate spires stretched into the sky like frozen music, and as I wandered through its vast, echoing interior, I could almost feel the weight of history in every carved stone and shaft of light. And its rooftop offers panoramic views of Milan and the Alps on clear days.
Unfortunately, we didn’t have an opportunity to reach the roof of it but we reserved St. Peter’s Basilica roof ticket which we look more forward to it.
Milan Central Station (Stazione Centrale)
Walking into Milan Central Station felt like stepping into a grand palace disguised as a train hub — its towering arches, ornate stonework, and sheer scale make it one of the most majestic railway stations I’ve ever seen, blending Fascist-era power with Art Deco elegance.
City №2: Venice
We only spent half a day in Milan and then took the fast train from Milan to Venice. You can see a lot of luxury shops there, but we are not rich enough, so why not leave earlier, right?
Right outside the train station, Ponte degli Scalzi was my first real step into Venice — it gave me that instant “I’m really here” moment, with boats gliding under its stone arch and the Grand Canal unfolding before me.
Barefoot bridge(Ponte degli scalzi)
Rialto bridge
The Rialto Bridge is pure drama — crowded, grand, and full of life. Standing at its peak, I watched gondolas, vaporettos, and reflections dance along the Grand Canal, Venice’s main artery pulsing with history.
St. Mark’s Square
St. Mark’s Square felt like the heart of an empire — wide, majestic, and echoing with footsteps and pigeons. Surrounded by grand architecture, I stood in awe beneath the domes of the Basilica and the watchful eye of the Campanile.
Ponte dell’ accademia (academy bridge)
Ponte dell’Accademia gave me my favorite panoramic view of the Grand Canal. The soft curve of the water, historic facades, and distant dome of Santa Maria della Salute — it all looked like a living painting.
Murano island (without picture)
In Murano, the furnaces burn hot and the glass glows. The island buzzes with centuries-old craft, and watching the artisans shape molten glass felt like peeking into a world of tradition and skill. I find it a bit crowded and boring.
Burano
Burano stole my heart. It was peaceful, almost dreamlike — with fewer tourists, quiet alleys, and rows of cheerful, colorful houses reflected in calm canals. It felt like a hidden storybook village where time slows down.
City №3: Florence
Florence is a city that feels both intimate and immense — it’s small enough to walk across, yet bursting with history at every turn. With its narrow streets, lively piazzas, and Renaissance beauty, it thrives quietly, blending daily life with timeless art. Everything is close: cathedrals, cafes, museums, and the river Arno. It’s a place where convenience meets cultural depth.
Uffizi Gallery
The Uffizi Gallery is a treasure trove of Renaissance masterpieces. Walking through its elegant corridors, I stood face to face with Botticelli’sBirth of Venus — graceful, ethereal, and iconic — and just steps away,Primavera (Spring), bursting with life and symbolism. Giotto di Bondone’s Madonna Enthroned stood solemn and powerful, a bridge between medieval devotion and the early stirrings of the Renaissance. Every room held a window into centuries of beauty, belief, and brilliance.
Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael Sanzio are three of the most famous and influential artists of the Italian Renaissance. They’re often considered the ultimate “trio” of Renaissance genius.
Giotto di Bondone’s Madonna Enthroned
Spring
Botticelli’s Birth of Venus
Gentleman -Raphael
Santa maria novella square (piazza santa maria novella)
Old bridge (ponte vecchio)
Michelangelo square
Santa croce square (piazza santa croce)
Pisa
Pisa is more than just its famous leaning tower — it’s a charming, walkable city with a laid-back vibe and deep historical roots. The heart of the city, Piazza dei Miracoli, feels almost surreal, with the Leaning Tower tilting beside the grand cathedral and baptistery, all glowing white against the green grass.
If you come here, don’t forget to take the iconic pictures with the Leaning Tower.
City №5: Rome
Rome (Capital) is a vast, booming city where ancient ruins and modern life collide in an exhilarating rhythm. It’s busy, loud, and alive — cars zip past thousand-year-old monuments, and every corner holds a piece of history. At the Colosseum, I stood where gladiators once battled, imagining the roar of the crowd echoing through time. The Borghese Gallery offered a quieter side of Rome — intimate rooms filled with masterpieces by Bernini, Caravaggio, and Canova. And at the Trevi Fountain, surrounded by crowds and coins tossed in mid-air, I joined the tradition, making a wish in front of its dramatic baroque sculptures.
Colosseum
Borghese Gallery
Trevi Fountain
Place №6 Vatican
Italy was breathtaking and full of unforgettable sights — from Venice’s canals to Rome’s ancient ruins — but there was never enough time to see it all. It was beautiful, intense, and exhausting in the best way.

Ah Italy. I always say that it is impossible to have a bad time in Italy. Not only are there so many beautiful cities in Italy, but you can also almost guarantee that they will all offer fantastic food, wine, and coffee.
As a travel blogger I am lucky enough to travel more frequently than the average person. I have actually now lost track of how many times I have visited Italy — it must be at least 15. And I don’t plan on stopping there — Italy will be one of my favourite travel destinations for the rest of my life.
So here are my 15 Most Beautiful Cities in Italy, some classics and some hidden gems.
I loved Syracuse — it was a highlight of Sicily where to stay. It is such a cute and atmospheric city. The old town of Ortygia is the place to stay, eat and wander. It is at its most magic as the sunsets.
Ortygia is the perfect Italian old town. It is full of little streets that are perfect for wandering. The best time to go is early evening — kick-off about 30 minutes before the sunset.
This Sicilian town is at its busiest at this point but this provides atmosphere rather than headaches. Don’t miss Ortygia’s famous fountain and the main square.
Ortygia also has fantastic shopping. There are lots of Italian classics but a large number of unique and interesting boutiques. There are also some of the nicest souvenir shops I have ever seen. My hot tip is Ortigia.
And don’t miss the nearby town Noto. This beautiful little town 40km away from Syracuse is full of beautiful pale coloured buildings.
I loved Sicily and have written several posts about it. Read about Where to Stay in Sicily, things to do in Sicily, my 7 Day Sicily Itinerary and the best Sicily Boutique Hotels.
Montepulciano is quite frankly heaven for wine lovers. This stunning hilltop Tuscan town is ridiculously beautiful and it is just filled with wine. Wineries, red wine, white wine, wine cellars, oak casks, wine shops, wine bars — it really is just wine-tastic! There are so many wineries in Montepulciano.
In addition to all that wine, Montepulciano is also a beautiful hilltop town. It is pedestrianised and full of small steep streets oozing with atmosphere — and some amazing restaurants and wine bars.
The main square of Montepulciano sits right at the top of the town and has a beautiful church and tower.
Read more in my post on the best 12 Best Wineries in Montepulciano and 7 Romantic Tuscany Boutique Hotels.
This gorgeous white city is set on a hilltop only 8km from the sea and one of the key Puglia destinations. It was raining when I visited but still very cute.
It is not easy to find your way around the narrow streets — apparently, the town was built without a plan which makes perfect sense after you have visited.
However, like many of these towns, the best thing to do when visiting Ostuni is to just explore and get a bit lost in the back streets.
It is a bit of a walk to get to the main part of the old city of Ostuni (right on the top of the hill) but it is worth it. There is a stunning cathedral and then views down to the sea from one side of the old town.
It is also extremely instagrammable with lovely arches, cute coloured doors, and shutters, white stone streets etc etc.
Read more about Ostuni in my post on the 7 Best Places to Visit in Puglia.
Yes it is a little dull to have Rome in a list of the most beautiful cities in Italy but the reality is that Rome is an incredibly beautiful city. Italy’s capital sits on the Tiber river and often has more tourist attractions in two streets than entire cities.
It is, of course, mandatory to visit the Colosseum, the Vatican, Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, etc but for me, the best of Rome is just walking through its beautiful streets and being in Rome.
I am lucky enough to have visited Rome 4 times and I plan to return. So when I do visit I like to just walk and wander and eat as much as I possibly can. It also provides an opportunity to explore more of the neighborhoods of Rome like Trastavere.
Plus Rome has some fantastic day trips like Hadrian’s Villa which I highly recommend.
Lovely Ravenna was the capital of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until 476. As such it has some stunning architecture which has been very well preserved and is home to several UNESCO sites.
But best of all Ravenna has mosaics. I had heard about the mosaics of Ravenna and in all honesty I had never been particularly excited about them. Until I visited Ravenna.
The Basilica di San Vitale, the Basilica di Sant’Apollinare Nuovo and the Galla Placidia Mausoleum all feature what can only be described as jaw droppingly beautiful mosaics over very large areas.
Plus Ravenna is a charming city with lots to explore and some wonderful restaurants.
Rimini has long been famous for its long stretches of golden sands and location on the Adriatic sea. However, the big surprise for me of Rimini was its absolutely charming old town.
Rimini was established in 268 BC by the Romans so there is a lot of Rimini history.
However, it has gone through considerable change — which has resulted in the absolutely lovely old town which is located in the heart of the Rimini Emilia Romagna Italy.
The beaches are still lovely but should be combined with the Rimini old town and plus some of the neighboring towns when it comes to the best things to do in Rimini.
Find out the 14 best things to do in Rimini in my post.
A bit like Rome, it isn’t possible to speak about beautiful cities in Italy without mentioning Venice. Sure it is usually full of tourists but it doesn’t stop it being a special moment when you first visit this famous city.
Whilst the gondola ride is a cliche it is also a lot of fun and very worthy of photos. Head to St Mark’s Square in the late afternoon to watch the sun turn Saint Mark’s Basilica into gold.
Again the best of Venice is walking its little back streets and taking a water bus or Vaporetto across the Grand Canal. Don’t miss Venice’s famous bridges like Ponte di Rialto and the beautiful glass blowing island Murano.
One of the largest cities in Italy’s bread basket region of Emilia Romagna, Parma is best known for its famous cheese and prosciutto. Personally I feel that a Parmesan tasting is mandatory for any visit to Parma.
However, Parma also has a beautiful cathedral, stunning piazzas, a gorgeous park, churches and of course terrific restaurants and cute backstreets.
Parma can also be a great base for exploring some of the other foodie towns of Emilia Romagna like Bologna and Modena (home of balsamic vinegar).
is the oldest republic in the world and it has never been taken over by anyone. This small country of just 61 square kilometres sits on top of a hill and overlooks the Italian countryside.
San Marino is home to just 30,000 people but has its own police, its own schools and it doesn’t belong to the European Union. So it isn’t actually Italy strictly speaking but I decided it was okay to put it in this post as it is kind of in Italy.
A hilltop town in Italy is always going to be at least a base level of photogenic. San Marino then has multiple sculptures, is mostly pedestrianized with lovely paved streets, excellent use of flowers throughout the country and amazing views everywhere.
The highlight of San Marino is walking to the very top of the country and its famous three towers which date back to the 11th century.
Another way to get some fantastic views of the Italian countryside is to take the compact San Marino funicular. The funicular will bring you up into the main square of San Marino.
Find out more about San Marino in my post on things to do in Rimini and nearby.
There are so many things to do in Puglia — and lovely UNESCO World Heritage Site Alberobello — which is also very fun to say — is one of Puglia’s Trulli towns.
A Trulli is basically a white stone cottage with a cone-shaped roof. They are a cross between something from early Star Wars and the kind of place you would expect to find in a desert in the middle east.
Which is of course why this lovely city is a UNESCO World Heritage site.
There are 1400 Trulli in the old town area of Alberobello. They are mostly located on small cobblestone streets of the historic centre that have been pedestrianized.
The best thing to do in UNESCO world heritage site Alberobello is wandering its cute streets. We followed the signs for the Centro and once we hit the pedestrianised area found the closest place to park.
From this point, there was a terrific view of the main square and the trulli section of town — great for photos.
We enjoyed an excellent pasta lunch with local wine at La Locanda Del Gallo. This cute little restaurant was inside a trullo and in the old part of town.
Read more about Alberobello in my post on the 7 Best Places to Visit in Puglia.
Lovely Lucca is the quintessentially beautiful Tuscan town. This walled city is filled with atmospheric back streets and cobblestones. It is known as the city of 100 churches so there are loads to visit if that’s your thing.
Piazza San Martino is home to Lucca’s very impressive Duomo. Piazza dell Anfiteatro was once a Roman ampitheatre. The Basilica San San Michele in Foro is another stunning church in Lucca.
For me the highlight of Lucca was walking its medieval walls. The walls have been very well preserved and it is possible to walk the entire circumference of the city.
Torre delle Ore provides a fantastic view and photo opportunity of the rooftops of Lucca.
Taormina is a ridiculously gorgeous town in Sicily. The town itself is pedestrianized and filled with cute backstreets and lovely architecture. Taormina is full of great restaurants, cafes and fantastic shops.
Taormina is definitely the place to go shopping in Sicily. It has a fantastic mix of classic Italian names you know like Furla and Coccinelle and super cute local stores filled with handmade shoes and handbags.
The Taormina main street is really the best place to go — I didn’t find as many good stores in the back streets. Handbags and purses are the things to buy here.
There are also many places to stock up on tasty Sicilian food products such as olive oil and balsamic vinegar plus lovely streets for strolling and some fantastic restaurants.
I loved Sicily and have written several posts about it. Read about Where to Stay in Sicily, things to do in Sicily, my 7 Day Sicily Itinerary and the best Sicily Boutique Hotels.
Bologna, Italy is popular as a holiday destination for a variety of reasons. The city has historical appeal, housing the oldest university in the western world.
It also features charming architecture, with over 20 towers dotted throughout the area. As well as numerous grand churches and cathedrals. And some of these historic buildings are home to the loveliest boutique hotels in Bologna.
Although Bologna has a well-preserved historical centre, it still exudes a trendy cosmopolitan character owing to its large student population. Its trendy atmosphere is perfectly complemented by its culinary reputation.
As the capital city of Emilia-Romagna, it forms part of a region with a food history just as old as its celebrated university.
Find out where to stay in my post on Bologna Boutique Hotels.
Urbino is a lesser-known walled city on a hilltop in central Italy. The Palazzo Ducale is the city’s main tourist attraction. The slope opposite the Palazzo offers some of the best views over Urbino.
Urbino is the tiniest Italian town in this post and that is part of its charm. This walled city has many small backstreets that are filled with Italian charm and character.
Home of Opera and Romeo and Juliet lovely Verona also has bags of Italian charm. It is a very walkable city and easy to get around.
The Arena di Verona is a highlight of any trip to this beautiful city in Italy. Visit during the day to get some great photos. I highly encourage you to book opera tickets before you head to Verona.
I am not the biggest opera fan but attending the opera in Verona in this beautiful amphitheater was a very memorable experience.
Climb to the top of Torre dei Lamberti for some fantastic views over Verona and enjoy the square where it is located, Piazza Delle Erbe.
Casa di Giulietta is Juliet’s house. The courtyard area is free to visit but you’ll need to pay if you want to step onto the balcony. Sure it’s a bit cheesy but seeing Juliet’s balcony is a must do in Verona.

First of all, it is good to remember that Italy is divided into twenty regions, and each region is different from the others, so life changes depending on which part of Italy you are in.
Living here (Livigno)
it’s different to live here (Milan)
Or here (Sardinia)
Or here (Umbria)
Or in my city (sorry, I have a soft spot for my city):
Ok, having said that, what is it like to live in Italy in general?
Disadvantages of living in Italy? Bureaucracy, taxes, and sometimes inefficiency of the public apparatus. (but not excessive).

Think you know Italy? Think again.
Though I knew a fair amount about Italian culture before moving to Calabria last year, I’ve learned a few things that have surprised me now that I’m here.
In the U.S., we are used to being spoiled by friends and family for our birthdays, aren’t we?
Here, it’s the opposite. You, the birthday girl, are supposed to take out your loved ones to celebrate you. I think it’s to offset the cost of the gifts that they give you.
This year, I avoided breaking the bank by having a party at my house instead. But I almost made a faux pas by offering to split a meal the day after my birthday with my “Italian mamma” until I remembered this strange cultural norm and quickly went to pay for our lunch.
I have never been big on blowdrying my hair, but in Italy, I get raised eyebrows.
It turns out, Italians believe in what they call a colpo d’aria, literally a hit of air. It causes, or so they believe, headaches, colds, and a litany of maladies. And having wet hair invites it.

Everyone has Italy on their travel bucket list, and for good reason. Italy has everything from beautiful landscapes to rich history. I have traveled to Italy at least once a year for the last six years. There are some cities you can’t see once, like Rome and Venice. Some others should be seen just once or avoided completely.
These are the three Italian cities I wouldn’t return to.
Italy’s third biggest city is not the most popular and for good reason. Naples is a city filled with so much history.
Dubbed the city with the most beautiful metro stations in the world. Naples has something for everyone, regardless of your interests. If you are a football enthusiast, It’s home to one of Europe’s most famous and oldest football teams. For those of us who love a bit of adventure, the south-east of Naples is home to the infamous mount Vesuvius. The glorious view of the city from the mountain’s summit is a must-see.
A twenty-minute boat ride from the center of the city will get you to the beautiful island of Capri. Another short boat ride away is the breathtaking Amalfi coast.
Before I got to Naples, I wondered why I hadn’t seen thousands of videos about it like I had for Rome, Venice and Milan. Upon arrival, it all started to make sense. For a city that had so much to offer, it had so much working against it.
According to Numbeo, Naples has one of the highest crime rates in Europe and has been that way for a long time. It’s the only city I’ve visited where military trucks camp in residential neighborhoods. The truck stationed a few meters from my Airbnb had at least 10 soldiers posted with it. I guess this was because the Santa Maria di Costantinopoli area was usually very busy, even after midnight. However, I was not quite sure if that made me feel safe or just uncomfortable.
The city has a bustling population. Be prepared for packed metro trains, along with a good number of pickpockets.
Naples is a tight knit city filled with a plethora of dark alleys and sketchy neighborhoods. Walking by some of these places late at night made me feel very uneasy. I could feel stares and the silence always made me feel like something was about to happen.
Will I visit Naples again? Yes! But, only briefly, as I’d use the city as a brief pass-way to the Amalfi coastal towns and Sorento.
This has got to be one of Italy’s least known cities. But, it’s one of those small cities that’s blessed with. a great location and history.
A small city in the southwest corner of the island of Sicily, Catania is one of those places I was happy to visit.
But I never want to visit again!
The best thing about Catania is its proximity to fascinating Italian places. An hour north from the city lies the tallest volcano in Europe, Etna. The imposing volcano can be viewed from almost all over Catania as well as the neighboring towns. Hiking up the volcano was an unforgettable experience. That one activity changed my entire perception on traveling.
2.5 hours from Catania is home to one of the most beautiful beaches in Italy, Taormina. The town is high up and boasts some breathtaking views of the sea.
Walking through the center of Catania, you will bump into many historical landmarks like Roman amphitheaters, tucked inside tiny neighborhoods. It is still an Italian city, so there’s no need to speak about the amazing food. Catania has all the pistachio you can eat and in every form imaginable.
However, the city is far from perfect!
Catania is the only Italian city with a higher crime rate index than Naples.
First thing that struck me when I arrived was how uptight and unfriendly the locals were. The only person I saw smile was my Airbnb host.
I remember almost getting hit by cars (yes, plural!) while walking on zebra crossings several times on my first day. I had a hard time getting a simple Covid test done, but I was lucky to meet some Italian-speaking Ghanaians who made things easier.
This was another city that was filled with a lot of sketchy areas. My second day in Catania, I was up at 5am to get some sweet sunrise photos. It was only a short 15 min walk from my Airbnb to a great spot by the dock, but somewhat uncomfortable.
Google’s shortest path had me walking in the dark through some questionable streets like Viale Africa with expensive camera gear. Needless to say, that was the only time I was out that early for sunrise pictures.
Yes! That Florence. The same history rich city that’s on everyone’s bucket list. Florence was my third stop on a backpacking trip across five cities in Italy a few years ago. My stay was brief but filled with unforgettable memories. Some good, some not so good.
Florence is beautiful, there’s no question about that.
I was blown away by the surreal details of the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore and the jaw dropping view of the city from Bulwark of San Giorgio.
The food, oh the food! We all know Italy is famous for its food, but dining in Florence was a whole new experience.
I could go on and on about the magnificence of Florence. But to keep this post short, I’ll dive into the reasons why I wouldn’t want to return in the future.
A bit of context, before this trip, I had already been living in Europe for a couple of years. Florence was the first experience of being tailed by security in a store. I stopped by a convenience store and the security guard stayed on my back. He didn’t return to his post until I left the store (I spent at least 30 mins shopping).
That was a new and uncomfortable experience for me, something I had only heard about on tv and vlogs.
Walking by the train station, one notable thing you would see from sunup to sundown is ”idle” people. This is common in most cities, why’s it different here? Aggression! They can come off a bit strong when asking for money.
I remember getting verbally harassed when I refused a guy’s request for money. It could have developed into a physical confrontation had I given him more attention.
To summarize, I didn’t hate my visit to any of these cities, on the contrary, I had some amazing moments there.
The purpose of this post is to help travelers be a bit more aware when they visit, especially the solo travelers.
Here are some tips that might help if you decide to visit:
Lastly, tell me your least favourite Italian city in the comments.
Cheers.

If you are a new student in Italy from another country, this story is for you! I’ve been living in Turin for about 5 years and want to share my experiences with you. If it helps even one person, I’ll be happy. 🥰
First, I give a brief introduction about myself. When I was in my own country (Iran, Tehran), I studied software engineering and working as a front-end web developer for 3 years. After a 5-year gaps, I returned to academia. 🤓📚
I moved to Italy, Turin in August 2019 and graduated in December 2022. I studied in Politecnico di Torino to get a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering with a Data Analytic specialty. I began working for one year as a business data Analyst; you can read more about my job experience here.
Before moving forward, I need to point out that these are just my personal observations and views; other people may have different experiences.
Okay, let’s have a look at the challenging parts of studying and living in Italy. 🤟🏼
Without a doubt, the most difficult aspect for me was Italian language! Yes years of studying English from bottom of my heart was nothing! 🥲 (Believe me I get used to study English as a hobby) and the fact is nearly 97% of the Italian population speaks Italian and only 13% of Italians speak English. English is a mandatory school subject in Italy, however it’s not taught very well.
The main reason my Italian hasn’t improved much, because my master’s degree was in English and I was surrounded by international students and academics, and when I started working, I noticed it was essential to know Italian language, and most of the recruiters will ask you about the level of your language and personally I lost some job opportunities just because I can’t speak Italian well. 🥲
Even if you work in a large company with foreign colleagues, don’t expect them to switch to English during the internal meetings, in coffee or lunch time; trust me, it’s hard for them and need to put more efforts. People in shops, post offices, and nearly everywhere speak Italian. 🤷🏻‍♀️
So, even if you don’t want to stay in Italy for ever, I recommend that you start learning Italian as soon as you decide to come here. 🤝 🇮🇹 Knowing the language will greatly improve your quality of life, as well as your ability to make friends and integrate. When you first try to speak Italian, Italians are quite helpful if they feel that you are making efforts. So, don’t be shy; start talking, even if you only know a few words, use them. 💪🏼
For the first year as a student on a tight budget, it was difficult for me to rent my own flat (In Italian: monolocale), So I lived in a shared house with other flatmates and roommates, but for the second and third years I had my own room in the university dormitories.
If you would like to live in a shared house, you should be prepared for the challenges that come with coexisting and living with other people. However, it might be helpful at first to not feel alone and making friendships and meet people who have a similar situation as you.
To find a house, try to check the Facebook or Telegram groups. Prices vary depending on location, proximity to universities, and city centre. Furthermore, it depends on the place where you live; for example, rent is more expensive in Milan or Rome than in Turin.
Overall, the process of finding a house takes time, so be patient and don’t be disappointed, especially at the start of the academic year, when new students will arrive, so begin searching earlier.
For the first year, I recommend having your own room in a shared house. Living with Italian flatmates can help you enhance your language skills during your free time too. 😎
If you want to preserve your state scholarship, you must pass specific credits each year, which requires dedication to studying. Most courses, aside from the exam, have a project that should be worked on during the semester, as well as a large amount of material to study DURING the semester; I emphasise DURING because if you study in Iran, you get used to studying a few days before the exam 😅 but this does not work in Italy at all 😣, and you should actively study, and you will most likely pass on the first call, but some exams you can pass or get your desired score after the second or third call. The lowest score is 18 🤌🏼, and the maximum is 30 ✌🏼.
I suggest doing other activities in your free time, such as joining a gym, going to nature, to avoid becoming overwhelmed and burnt out from only studying. 🥵
Thinking about staying in Italy in the future depends on your preferences; if you know Italian well and like good food 🍕🍝🍷(who doesn’t?! 😄) and sunny weather ☀️🌊 ⛱️, then Italy is your place 🤝 or you may prefer to stay in a country that has better facilities for immigrants (like Germany, Netherlands, Belgium or Canada or America).
Italy lacks infrastructure for immigrants; as an example in order to obtain a driver’s licence, I need to know Italian (at the B1 level) or you can get a passport after ten years! While In other countries, you can obtain earlier than this. Also consider that the base salary and expenses are lower in compare with the other countries.
I hope you enjoyed this story, please let me know your feedback or if you want to know more about living in Italy.
Have a nice day and thanks for reading! 🥰

Hello you!
If you know me, you know how much I obsess over the movie Eat Pray Love and Julia Roberts’ performance in it. Ever since I watched Julia in the movie enjoying her best life in Italy — living alone, learning Italian, eating pasta (my favorite food) and pizza, drinking lots of wine, and making lovely, warm friends — I knew I wanted that. Here’s the tweet — oh, I mean, X post — I saved up to express this goal of mine.
One of my favourite scenes from the movie is when Julia eats pasta and drinks wine in Italy. That moment, along with her performance, is pure bliss.
Today, I watched Emily in Paris, Season 4, Part 2. Spoiler alert!
I saw a similar scene where Emily and Marchello eat Italian food with the same sense of bliss, making me feel warm and smile. It reminded me how much I longed for that full Italian experience, just like Julia Roberts in Eat Pray Love.
Italy, await me. I’ll see you soon!🥂

Over the past seven years, I’ve lived in Southern Italy for at least three months a year. In the past two years, my partner and I have lived in Italy full-time, most of it in the south.
Between November of 2019 and November of 2021, we hadn’t actually been back to the States. When we finally were able to go back without fear of being denied re-entry to Italy, we realized there were so many little tricks we learned along the way.
My first experience in southern Italy came in the spring, when I flew over from China to visit my mom, who happened to be renting an apartment in a small town.
Coming from the Southeast in America to this small, damp town located in the foothills of the Cilento, my mom had her radiators on full blast.
During one particularly chilly afternoon, we were offered a coffee from a neighbor up the road. When we arrived at her house, we found the entire family in the kitchen, huddled around a TV, fire merrily dancing in the fireplace. The neighbor explained that in the winter, families will retreat to one room, usually the one with a fireplace or wood pellet stove. Gas, the main source of heat, is expensive, and…

Why Saying ‘Arrivederci’ to ‘Careless’ Meat and Cheese is Key to Restoring Italy’s Relationship with Food
I’ll never forget my summer road trip through the land of gastronomy. I spent several days touring Italy’s most fertile agricultural valley. I marveled at the pretty villages with picturesque churches and hilly backdrops. The endless pastures and crop fields. The balmy days of blue skies and t-shirt temperatures. Friendly people at every turn. And the smell of the most delicious food.
No wonder Italy is so widely cited as the world’s number one for cuisine. Whether pizzas, pastas or gnocchi served with a myriad of flavours, Italy seems to have it all.
Italian food engenders an exhilaration like no other; what world-renowned Italian chef, Giorgio Locatelli describes as the “the relationship between food, sex, wine and the excitement of life”.
Except, there was something missing. In my days traversing the fields, valleys and plains of the rich Italian countryside, I never once saw a farm animal outside. It was an irony that has stayed with me ever since.
Where were the cows producing milk for world-famous Parmesan or Grana Padano? Or the pigs renowned for Parma ham? Or the chickens producing eggs for Carbonara?
Quality not quantity
What I discovered is that farmers in Italy’s richest agricultural region had forgotten how to keep animals outside. They simply had a blind spot. They couldn’t see why it wasn’t right to keep them cooped up indoors all day, every day. They couldn’t see the irony of grass being grown then mowed and packed into bales to feed incarcerated cows.
They had lost sight of the fact that cows, pigs, and chickens like to feel fresh air and sunshine as much as we do.
It put me in mind of something else Locatelli once said: “It is better to have fantastic meat once a week than fill ourselves up every day with cheap, carelessly reared meat. We all have to get used to quality, not quantity.”
Famous cheeses
The most surprising discovery on my travels through the Italian countryside was the way dairy cows were kept, not least for those world-renowned iconic cheeses of Parmesan and Grana Padano.
I remember checking the production details for Parmesan and Grana Padano and finding they both mentioned the cows being raised on fresh grass and hay.
But cows wandering the fields, gently tugging at grassy stalks or chewing the cud under the shade of trees, were conspicuous by their absence; the only cows I could find were crammed into darkened sheds.
I remember seeing a hundred cows peering out of a single square shed. They were trapped inside but had a perfect view of the lush pasture they were prevented from grazing on.
I watched incredulously as heavy goods vehicles delivered grass to a processing plant. A yellow tractor scooped grass into a giant machine, while yet more trucks took compacted blocks of grass and drove them away.
Instead of letting the animals graze in a time-honoured fashion, mechanically pressed bales were being produced to feed confined cattle.
What happened to cow paradise?
In what should have been a cow’s paradise, nature’s way had been abandoned.
According to the Grana Padano consortium, 80 per cent of their cows are denied pasture access with approximately 40 per cent confined indoors, not even having outdoor ‘paddocks’.
It reinforced my impression that we now have a generation of cattle farmers in Italy that simply don’t know how to keep animals as nature intended — on pasture.
I wondered whether things were now different for those cows milked for Parmesan — or Parmigiano Reggiano to give its full name. Surely, this ‘king of cheeses’ would be made from the milk of cows that are kept on grass?
Like Grana Padano and many other regional foods, strict rules govern the manufacture of Parmesan. Given its protected status, only cheesemakers from Parma, Reggio Emilia, parts of Bologna, Modena and Mantua can qualify.
My enquiries to the Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano Reggiano, the consortium that governs the manufacture of Parmesan in 2016 resulted in them sharing that the proportion of cows grazing freely in fields for them during the summer months was “very low”.
I was told that there were few exceptions, perhaps as few as one per cent of their farms had cows out grazing. In 2023, I asked them for an update and received no reply.
Known as ‘zero-grazing’ — keeping cows indoors permanently — I subsequently found that it was common practice all over Italy.
As Kees de Roest wrote in The Production of Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese: The Force of an Artisanal System in an Industrialised World, ‘almost all Italian dairy farms apply the zero-grazing system’.
Whilst cows are confined indoors, Italy’s crop fields are often dedicated to growing feed for them rather than food for people.
Unsustainable
About half of Italy’s cereal crop is used to feed intensively reared animals. In addition, the country is a big importer of soya, importing about 3 million tonnes a year, much of which is used to feed industrially reared animals.
Farmed animals are now spookily conspicuous by their absence from the fields and valleys of Italy’s Po Valley.
Which reminded me of those prophetic words by Italian chef, Giorgio Locatelli who warned against eating cheap, carelessly reared meat, saying, “We all have to get used to quality, not quantity.”
Putting quality back on our plate seems the right ingredient for ensuring that Italian cuisine once again reflects that fabled relationship between food, sex, wine and the excitement of life.
Saying ‘arrivederci’ to keeping cows permanently indoors should be a big part of a recipe for nature-friendly food for the future.

Originally written for The Unexplorer.
Every day, I learn something more about my new home in Calabria, Italy. I now laugh at how much I DIDN’T know before I moved to Italy. Hopefully, this post will help you gain a few more nuggets of wisdom if you’re planning to relocate to Italy!
I’ll be in the middle of a deep conversation with a friend or my boyfriend and then the phone rings. 98% of the time, they’ll answer.
While many Americans also keep their ringers on and answer or respond to texts, by far, the Italians have them beat. They will respond no matter what they’re doing. (Do not ask me to elaborate. You can use your imagination here!)
And if they’re the ones calling and if they get no answer, they’ll call again. And again. And again. Italian phone numbers don’t have voicemail, so you can let the phone ring until tomorrow if you want.
This is one frustration I haven’t gotten over. I feel like when you’re with people in person, they should be your focus, not whoever’s calling to shoot the shit.

Italy is my happy place. There are so much to love I don’t know that I can fully articulate them all. I fell in love with this magical country over a decade ago on my first trip to Florence and Rome. For me, there was something that happened when I took that first sip of Italian wine while sitting at a quintessential Italian bistro. For me, it was a sort of spiritual awakening. I didn’t feel like a tourist at all. I felt like I was finally coming home. So much so that when I took my 23 and me test a few years back I was convinced it would come back confirming what I felt in my soul. Turns out I’m only 7% Italian, but one can dream.
Fourteen years and four trips later I am more in love with Italy than I’ve ever been. Every time I leave to come home, I’m already obsessing over when I can go back. Time doesn’t stand still and we can’t ever duplicate an experience though. I’ve learned to embrace this over the years. Because of this, each of my trips to Italy have been dramatically different. So much so that my perspective and appreciation of Italy changes a little each time. I have learned a few simple things during this time that I want to share to make your journey everything it should be.
One of the most spectacular things about Italy is the landscape. You don’t want to miss a minute of it. To miss out on this part of the journey is like missing out on seeing the ocean if you visit the Oregon coast. For this reason, if you’re visiting multiple cities on your trip the only way to do this is by train. Do not; I repeat; do not waste your precious time on a bus. It is by far slower, stinkier, and you miss out on much of the countryside( I know this unfortunately by experience). The train system in Europe is very convenient. I recommend using the app Omio. You can search and purchase tickets from city to city, find the quickest and most inexpensive routes, and then store your tickets right to your I-phone or smart phone. Book a window seat so you can be sure to take in all of the amazing views. Pro tip: Pack lightly and make sure your bags are easily accessible when you disembark the train. This process can get a little bit chaotic, but still so worth it.
Everyone enjoys a summer vacation. School tours, large groups, and just about everyone in between will be in Italy in the summer. For this reason, if you can manage the timing heed my advice when I tell to you go during a non-peak season. Not only will you avoid the stifling heat, you will pay less for pretty much everything, you will get to have some leisure that doesn’t happen when you are battling the summertime crowds. You can enjoy your time in front of the David without waiting in line and then having to fight your way to front just to get a photo. Imagine standing in the middle of St. Mark’s Square in Venice, with only a handful of other tourists ( I have very fortunately experienced this). Or picture yourself standing in the Sistine Chapel without wall to wall people. This is an experience that precious few can say they’ve encountered while traveling in Italy.
While you’re taking time to get in touch with your inner Italian make sure you allow your eyes to move from the map you’re using. Close the navigation on your phone and please get lost. One of the beautiful things about being in a foreign country is allowing yourself to wander. We live in an age of maps and GPS everywhere so I realize this can be challenging. But by putting the directions away you will find that you start to see what’s right in front of you instead of planning how to get to the destination on your mental to-do list. Roaming through the streets of a walled city in Tuscany is something you won’t regret or ever forget. Allow yourself to stumble upon the unique local shops and chat with the friendly Italians. While I agree that some planning is necessary on your journey the real adventure comes when you let yourself drift and soak up the treasures just waiting for you.
Italy is truly a remarkable place. There’s an omnipresent feeling that you’re surrounded genius works of art and culture. I challenge you to visit and enjoy, but always save a little bit to explore on your next trip. I do hope that your journey allows you get in touch with a little bit of your Italian and keeps you coming back for more. You won’t regret the views from the train. You’ll not want to miss any of the Italian wine while you eat the best pasta of your life. And don’t forget to find yourself on a street that you hadn’t planned on visiting, soaking up a view that you didn’t realize was waiting for you.

Italy has to be on everyone’s travel shortlist — and, for a long time, it was on mine as well. It’s a destination like Paris or London or Tokyo that fills people with wonder and has an iconic feeling thanks to Hollywood and everyone’s brag-worthy Insta shots.
I can’t say why we hadn’t made it to Italy yet. We’ve been working our way through Europe country-by-country, mainly as add-ons to my work trips. There are other places I’ve gravitated towards first because they have been a bit higher on my list. We also took a massive three-week trip in 2013, and while we went to Portugal and Spain, Italy didn’t make the cut.
But I happened to have a work trip to Zurich for The Company in December, and since we did Denmark and Sweden the following year in November and froze to death, we decided to go south this trip and finally check Italy off of the list.
Italy was disappointing.
That’s not a popular sentiment. I’m dear friends with many Italophiles, and I love them and trust their opinions, but I’ve since learned that I don’t have to love all destinations equally. And Italy just isn’t my jam.
I tried to break this down into broader categories, and I realized that there are a few things that I look for when I travel:
Order: If we think about a continuum from order to chaos, I’m a lover of order. I find that chaotic places can be somewhat anxiety-triggering, but beyond that I find a smoother travel experience when it’s easy to get from A to B and when people know how to queue in lines in an orderly fashion. Even if it’s not the structure that I know, I’m happy to stand back and observe the rules and adapt to them.
Politeness: A close cousin to order is the politeness of the people in individual interactions. Are people open and kind? Do they hold doors, try to stay quieter at night, or stand up to give seats on transit for expectant mothers? When you treat someone with respect, do they respond in kind?
Warmth: How welcome do you feel, even if you are different? Do people welcome you into their lives and their families? One country that feels incredibly warm to me is Mexico — just pull up a chair and join the family! You are welcome no matter who you are and feel that people genuinely care about you.
History/Culture/Stuff to Do: This is actually the easiest requirement of all because I find so many things interesting! I can find something interesting in almost any place.
[Note: One huge exception here is camping. I don’t camp. I hate it and I refuse to spend my vacation doing something I can’t stand. So if camping is the attraction, or the accommodation, I’m out.]
So when I step back and think about my favorite trips I’ve ever taken, it’s not surprising that they would score highly across the board. If I were to rate my favorites, the top three thus far are Australia, Austria, and Hawai’i. Each of these is quite different, with different things that attract me, and each has their own detractions (scary creatures, weather, humidity, excess sand, etc.), but they are places that have a good orderliness, polite and warm people, and interesting cultural sites and activities.
The big attraction to Italy was the culture and the history. It’s the freakin’ Roman empire — how amazing to visit a society that was such a powerhouse for a thousand years! So when I think about the highlights of our visit to Rome and Florence, these cultural attractions made the biggest impression on us.
But Italy did not score so well in the categories of order, politeness, and warmth. Whenever I mention this to an Italophile they express one of two things. First, they might express regret that I didn’t experience the Italy that they love (one dear friend said, “Well, by the fifth or sixth time Italy is amazing!” which made me laugh that I’d have to do four more trips like this to discover the charm of the place). And I can see that this could be true because there were pockets of warmth. There was the amazing B&B host in Florence who gave us a mini walking tour around the B&B and kept adding recommendations to our map (to the point that I kept feeling bad that he was taking up so much time). We had some very kind servers at some of the restaurants in Rome, especially those we visited in the Jewish quarter.
But this was not a country filled with politeness or order. It felt a lot like Portugal — a city that was once great but that was, quite literally, in decay. I found the Italians en masse to be loud, pushy (literally) and rude. Sometimes their aggression is well-served — say, in the way that they drive — but in other cases it just seemed misplaced.
I have some empathy for what Romans must experience, living in a city that every idiot tourist in the world wants to visit. They tromp off of their air-conditioned coaches in khaki shorts and big white tennis shoes, stopping in the center of the sidewalk to unfurl their maps or position their selfie sticks. I get it. These are the same idiots that show up in Seattle in June, July, and August.
What frustrates the crap out of me is that we work very, very hard to not be that kind of tourist. I’ve found that learning some of the local language can be incredibly helpful. I’ll never forget my first trip to France with some friends. One of them refused to say “Bonjour” when we entered shops, instead saying “HI!” in a super-American accent. Greetings are one of the simplest ways to show respect of other cultures — it doesn’t take more than 30 minutes to learn five basic phrases in a language, and now that we have the Internet, there’s no excuse!
When it came to Italian, I spent two months learning a bit more than the basics on DuoLingo. Yes, it did help a little, but in most cases it helps grease the skids for moments of connection. Not in Italy. Not at all.
Two other simple adjustments we make when we travel is in the way that we dress and the way that we behave in public. If you’ve ever been on a train in Germany or a flight in Sweden you’ll notice how quietly people converse, mindful of the shared spaces that they are in. These are places where one doesn’t need to draw attention to oneself through behavior or dress. Dressing for the road is actually rather simple — we wear clothing that is classic and plain, or in muted patterns (like stripes, small checks, or small florals). We ditch the clothes with words and jokes and logos to go for the pan-European look. Because of how we look physically people are often unsure where we’re from (no one ever guesses Mexico for Sergio!), and because of this we can “pass” for different nationalities. The best compliment to me when traveling in Europe is for someone to think I am Swiss or German (but I’ll take Canadian!), and I take a lot of joy when I say that I am American — just one who is considerate in other countries!
All of this amounted to nothing in Italy. No amount of blending behavior worked at all. Maybe that’s because we weren’t blending with the culture? But even if you can’t blend, I had hoped there would be some appreciation that we weren’t obnoxious.
In the end, I think my experience of traveling in Italy was very much like my travels to New York City. It’s not popular to say this, but I’m not a fan of NYC. Sure — there are lots of things to do and see. I love the museums and the shows and the food. But it entirely lacks in charm and warmth, not to mention trees (I’ll give Rome this — they do have some trees here and there).
One last note, and that’s food. Food might be the fifth category, if there is one. My opinion on food has changed since I’ve modified my diet (no dairy plus I follow a modified version of the FODMAP diet) — I’m interested in the local cuisine, but in some countries the choice foods aren’t something I can eat. Italy is a great example — most pizza and pasta is covered in cheese, a big no-no for me.
I admit that we sinned big one night and had lasagna, which was delicious and worth the stomachache. Italian food was good, but since it’s widely available, there wasn’t much about it that felt so special that I could only get it there. This is different than some other cuisines where it is very difficult to get authentic cuisine outside of the place. Have you ever had amazing barramundi in the US? What about perfect shave ice outside of Hawai’i? Or flødeboller outside of Scandinavia? Or perfect spaetzle and strudel outside of Bavaria?
So that’s that. Italy turned out to be a bit of a bomb for me. We don’t have any upcoming work trips planned to Europe, but we do have a big trip planned in the spring! For something completely different, we’re going to Norway, Estonia, and Finland! To say that I’m excited is an understatement. A fair bit of my heritage is Norwegian (with a bit of Swedish and Finnish thrown in for luck), so I’m excited to visit Norway in particular. We’ve also visited both Denmark and Sweden, and while the Scandinavians aren’t the warmest people when you first meet them, those countries score off-the-charts on order, politeness, and history! I’m going to start learning basic Norwegian phrases next month!
Ciao for now, Sarah

After 15 years of transcontinental trips, I finally accomplished my goal of visiting all 20 regions of Italy (magically, just before the pandemic hit). I will continue to return over and over, as there is so much more to see and do and learn, but in this blog series I look back, through the rear-view mirror, and share some of the highlights I discovered along the way — One region at a time.
Piedmont sits in northwest Italy, bordered by France and Switzerland, as well as by the Italian regions of Aosta, Lombardy, and Liguria. As its name suggests, Piedmont lies at the foot (pie) of the mountains (monte). Italy’s second largest region, it is surrounded by mountains on three sides and is home to many of the highest peaks and largest glaciers in Italy. The landscape is incredibly diverse, from rugged peaks to rolling hills covered with vineyards, to rice fields and plains.
Turin is the regional capital, was the first capital city of Italy, and for centuries before that was the heart of the Kingdom of Savoy. Not surprising, the city is rich in history and culture. A mix of elegant Baroque, Neo-classical and Art Nouveau architecture (more reminiscent of Paris and Vienna than Rome and Naples), combined with broad, portico-lined streets, sets its historic centre apart. Many of Italy’s more traditional medieval centres that I have visited (e.g., Florence, Siena, Bologna) tend to have narrow, haphazard streets, and stocky Romanesque architecture. The differences are striking
My experiences in Piedmont (Piemonte) centred around Turin, where I spent 2 weeks during the World Masters Games (2013) and Monferrato, where I spent 3 weeks working at a winery and agriturismo (2019). I also felt compelled to return to both place in 2021, to reconnect with friends from my earlier visits. My eyes were opened wider with each visit.
La Casaccia Agriturismo and Winery sits about an hour east of Turin. For some background, I was at La Casaccia as a volunteer, working in exchange for room and board (part of an exchange program called WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms that I highly recommend for anyone who wants an authentic Italian experience). For me it was a way to extend my stays in Italy without breaking the bank, to practise my Italian and, as much as possible, to live like a local. Mission accomplished!
I chose La Casaccia for several reasons. A major draw was its location in Piedmont, a region I wanted to spend more time exploring. The fact that La Casaccia was a B&B /agriturismo as well as a winery was also appealing, as I was sure to learn more as I helped out in the variety of activities. It turned out to be an amazing experience with a wonderful host family. I did everything from preparing breakfast for B&B guests to working in the garden and kitchen (where I learned some local recipes), to working in the cellars and vineyards (helping prepare for and participate in the vendemmia, or wine harvest, as well as in the production process for the various organic wines they made). I loved every minute of it, and my return visit 2 years later felt like a family reunion.
While at La Casaccia, I also had the luxury of exploring the area on electric bikes the family owned. Something I highly recommend if you get the chance, particularly since the area is quite hilly. The vineyard landscapes of Langhe Roere and Monferrato that I biked through are a designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Piedmont is a spectacular region of Italy. My visits offered just a glimpse of what it has to offer. Click here for more information about Piedmont and here for information on the Monferrato wine region and its wines.
I look forward to hearing from you about your highlights from Piedmont, whether you are a travel enthusiast, lover of Italy, reader, writer (or all of the above!) and especially about your experiences getting off the trodden path and seeing Italy from all its amazing angles. For more about my experiences through other regions of Italy please check back for new posts. You can also check out my website Susan J Bocock Author

Oh, Italy. Your vast landscapes, rich history and culture, gorgeous architecture and inexpensive cappuccinos, how I love thee. Before taking a week long roadtrip through Italy, I had expected nothing but bliss. While there was definitely bliss, there were quite a few roadblocks (like, literally.) Now that I know the quirks of traveling in Italy, my next trip there will probably look completely different, and I want to make sure that you’re set up for success for your own trip! From start to finish, here’s everything you need to know about traveling in Italy from Milan to the Amalfi Coast.
Where to Stay
When asking what most millennial’s would want from a travel guide, most of my Instagram followers said, “budgeting tips!” Obviously, where to stay takes up a significant portion of your traveling budget. That being said, I definitely suggest booking Airbnb’s on your trip in Italy if you are looking for a cost-effective experience. Here are some ways to make the most out of your #AirbnbExperience.
Not all Airbnb’s are created equal: Something I didn’t know is the difficulty of finding and entering Italian Airbnb’s. I’m sure there are areas in Italy where newer apartments/homes are available, however, NOT SO with where we stayed. Keep in mind that the buildings in Italy are, well, ancient. It is rare to find an elevator in apartment/condo buildings, and even if you do, it might be the kind that you have to manually open and close the doors of and still hike up a floor (yes, this happened.)
Prepare to sweat: If running AC is a dealbreaker for you in the summer (like it is for most people), make sure to select “Air conditioning” in Airbnb’s search options. If you don’t, you might end up trying to decide whether it’s a good idea to sleep naked with all the windows wide open all night. In the winter, this wouldn’t pose as much of an issue, since it is quite nice in the evening, but if you opt for a non-AC equipped unit in the summer just to save a few bucks, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Your host WILL meet with you and it MIGHT be awkward: A funny detail about Italy is that most Airbnb’s are run like hotels. Families own entire floors of old apartments and rent them out. That being said, check-in won’t be done solo. Unlike America, where your host will typically hide the key, wish you goodluck and not speak to you until they leave you a *fingers-crossed* kind review, Italians greet you at the street corner, will carry your bags, walk with you to the apartment, then sit with you in the living room giving you local tips. At first, this made me uncomfortable. After realizing how absolutely crucial it is to travel with a local’s tips, I looked forward to each check-in process. Don’t hurry them out, listen to every last word like it’s your religion.
Travel tax is often not included in the cost: Prepare to pay between €1–2 per person per night* at each place you stay. It’s often not included in the Airbnb cost so have euros readily available at every location. Also, prepare for your host to snap a photo of your ID or Passport. This alarmed me at first, but it is actually Italian law to report your guests to the government with their valid ID. Who knew?
*This cost maxes out after three days in one location. If you hop around Italy every few days staying in different locations, it will renew and you’ll need to pay the tax at each location.
Transportation
My favorite flight tracking site is SkyScanner, second favorite is the app Hopper. Watch flight costs and book when it’s low, then plan to travel in Italy one of two ways: public transportation or rent a car.
Car rental: If you’re absorbing the cost of more than one person (like, if you’re married, OR have the option to split travel costs with friends) it’s cheaper overall to rent a car. Tolls were around €200, the rental itself was €700, and we chose a diesel car so that every tank of gas would take us farther. We were crossing a country border, so it’d cost around that just to get to one location in Italy for both of us. However! I do not suggest driving in Italy. You might save overall, but the time wasted trying to find parking, (and in some places, paying for parking) is not easy. If you rent a car in Italy, each driver will require an Italian driver’s permit. You can acquire one at your local AAA office in the US for $20. (To my knowledge, you can not acquire one once you are overseas.)
Trains, trams, and busses: Get to Italy by plane and there will be a train station either underneath or within walking distance of any airport. Get a pass that covers the duration of your stay and you’re set. Trams and busses are optional depending on location, so I wouldn’t plan ahead for these. Depending on how many locations you visit, this is probably the best option for you. I can’t guarantee what your overall cost would be, but if you’re a solo traveler it’s most definitely the way to go.
How to Pack Light
The easiest way to pack light is by following the capsule wardrobe rules. My favorite capsule wardrobe concept is the 10x10 wardrobe created by Lee Vosberg of the Style Bee Blog. Here are the rules: pick any 10 items (not including accessories or jewelry) from your current closet and style those items into 10 different looks. Easy! The basic formula is choosing 4 tops, 2 bottoms, 1 dress, 2 shoes, 1 top layer. Pay attention to the local weather (duh) when packing, and look for inspiration by searching the #10x10Friends hashtag on Instagram!
After the fun things are packed, don’t forget the boring yet completely necessary things. If your luggage is full, purchase a space saver bag to secure your clothing in—it really will save you tons of space inside your luggage!
Budgeting
Budgeting for travel begins way before you book the flight or get on the plane.
My overall rule for budgeting is based on the rules of minimalism. I spend on experiences, not things. I don’t buy what I don’t need, and I think about purchases long and hard before taking the plunge. If traveling is a desire or a goal for you, sacrifice has to come from somewhere. Think of the person you see online constantly traveling. Unless they’re a total baller or just racking up credit card debt, the money being spent has been saved for that moment. They’re sacrificing in one area so that they can experience life more fully in another. So, stash your cash monthly toward a traveling fund rather than letting it slowly drain from your bank account simply because it’s there and available.
Additionally, don’t overspend on your zero-transaction fee credit cards (I’m really pushing for these) while you’re abroad. Stay in line with your routine budget**. It’s easy to get carried away, but painful once all those swipes reveal themselves on your monthly statement.
Overall, I can’t tell you what to or not to buy. That’s ultimately up to you. But I can advise you to evaluate your “must have/see/do’s” and ditch the things that don’t actually interest you. If it’s not your thing, don’t go to a museum because everyone tells you to, don’t rent a beach chair because I tell you to, don’t wait in line or take a tour of a monument that everyone posts on Instagram but you could care less about. See the places you want to see with your own eyes, not the eyes of your friends, family, coworkers, etc. Clearly define your traveling desires before lift-off and your life on-the-road will be easier.
**If you don’t have a routine budget, I highly suggest starting here!
Now, to the fun part! Find Airbnb, restaurant, and budgeting suggestions below for each location we visited in Italy!
MONTEROSSO AL MARE (Cinque Terre)
Where to Stay: I highly suggest staying in this Airbnb. This is one of the locations that is run like an actual bed and breakfast and is literally steps from the ocean and “new town” center.
Where to Eat: You won’t need to search very far for delicious eats. Down the main street of old and new town, you’ll pass at least thirty shops offering two cappuccinos and croissants for no more than €6. Eat at these spots during the day and save the ones below for your evening dining!
€: Fornaio Di Monterosso
€€: Bar Davi
€€€: Torre Aurora, L’Ancora della Tortuga
What to Wear: After one hour in the sun you will shed all your clothing and end up in the ocean. Wear your swimsuit, throw on shorts and a tank and call it a day. In the evening, wear something light and comfortable for dinner. You’ll see people dressed up for dinner, so if you plan to bring an outfit that makes you feel fancy when sipping on your cocktail of choice.
Local Tips: This is truly a hang out at the beach all day, shop at the mini-markets and eat your weight in seafood kind of place. The way to really enjoy it is by getting up early and snagging an umbrella by the shore while you can. The cheapest spot is right outside the Beach Bar Stella Marina. (It costs €30 for two chairs and an umbrella for the entire day.) You can purchase the spot and it’s yours until after the sun sets! Leave your towels and wander around when it’s too hot to tan, grab a bite to eat, grab some souvenirs, then come back and take a nap in the shade. If you plan to be there for a few days, get a train ticket (the train stops literally right smack by the ocean in the center of “new town”) for the duration of your stay so that you can hop around to the other four towns in the Cinque Terre, because Monterosso is only one of five!
Budgeting: The nice thing about Monerosso al Mare is that you can count on spending around €50 per day, umbrella included (if you’re not counting the Airbnb cost.) Street food is delicious and ridiculously inexpensive. Get your fill on €1 cappuccinos, croisants and gelato, then treat yoself at dinner. Budget a little extra for shopping and alcohol and you’re good to go. Side note: You can get a bottle of wine at dinner for only $18, soooo, yeah, you’re gonna wanna get that.
ROME
Where to Stay: This Airbnb was gorgeous but difficult to enter and the AC wasn’t fantastic. But it was right smack in between Vatican City and the Colosseum, so we didn’t have to spend money on transportation. If you’re able-bodied (keep in mind that you must climb a flight of stairs after taking a manual elevator) and don’t mind waiting for the air to cool down, book this Airbnb for its charm and location. If not, find one with AC and easy entry in the surrounding area.
Where to Eat: We were only in Rome for one day, but each of these spots were to die for. These are a MUST when in Rome.
€: Da Simo Pane e Vino, Pergamino Caffè, and best gelato in Rome, Della Palma!
€€: II Corallo
What to Wear: Rome is hot in the summer. Like, real hot. The locals are extremely fashionable, but they’re also adjusted to the heat, so, not sure where I land on this one. Use your own discretion. I do suggest comfortable sneakers, though, since you’ll be on foot all day.
Local Tips: Assuming you’re visiting Rome to see Vatican City, The Colosseum, etc. prepare to spend a half day or more at each location. Drink lots of water and prepare to pay to use any public restroom! Have euros on hand, always!
Budgeting: This location is hard to indicate a set budget for because everyone’s preferences are different. But things you can keep in mind: most everything to see has a fee, coffee and pastries are cheap as they are everywhere in Italy, a fine lunch/dinner can cost anywhere from €8–30 per person, and bottles of wine at dinner are CHEAP.
AMALFI COAST
Where to Stay: Our Airbnb was an absolute dream. We were a short bus ride away from central Amalfi and just down the road from a cafe, beach, and a few restaurants. This specific location is on the side of a cliff. Dreamy, but takes a quick downward hike to get to since there aren’t elevators on the sides of mountains.
Where to Eat: Surprisingly, we only ate two meals in Amalfi. One dinner, and one “breakfast”, which was actually just a croissant and a cappuccino (the only way to do breakfast in Italy!) The restaurant is, shockingly, not on maps and I can’t even remember the name. However, if you walk around in the city-center long enough, you’ll find a spot. This is the type of place to leisurely walk around and land upon a spot that captures your attention!
What to Wear: I was genuinely surprised to realize that this is not as much of a “beach town” as I’d expected. This is more of a luxurious, million-dollar-making, yacht-owning, white-elitist’s playground than a beach bum’s paradise. If you want to keep up, dress up. If not, don’t. I personally walked around in a swimsuit and shorts all day with my hair in a bun and my face red hot from the sun. But that’s just me.
Budgeting: Ironically, this specific city isn’t overwhelmingly expensive unless you’re staying in one of the high-end resorts. The food is cheap, the beach is free, you can get a few inexpensive bus tickets to take you to local cities like Praiano, Positano and Naples. However, if you’re not hopping from town to town and you’re not the stay-in-our-Airbnb-all-day type, you might run out of things to do. The city-center is beautiful to walk through, but isn’t very large, so keep that in mind when choosing to visit this city or not.
CAPRI
Where to Stay: We stayed in Amalfi—we took the ferry to Capri early one morning and returned later that afternoon.
Where to Eat: We only ate one meal in Capri, and it wasn’t great, so I won’t mention its location. However, try to find a restaurant off the beaten path because it will be less touristy, better priced and much more delicious. One that was suggested to us by our boat tour skipper was La Canzone Del Mare!
What to Wear: Pretty much everyone is in their swimsuits with a cover-up since the only things to do here are go swimming, boating, tan, drink, and eat. P.S. the sun is HOT so make sure to pack an eco-friendly, organic sunscreen.
Budgeting: Ferries to and from Capri will cost you €40 per person, a tour to the Blue Grotto varies between €15–35, a private boat tour will cost you around €180, and the food is between €12–30 per plate. You’re looking at a wild day of spending but a mind-blowing array of beauty, so, soak it up!
FLORENCE
Where to Stay: I am not joking when I say that the Duomo is in full sight from this Airbnb. It is steps from the city-center and is equal distance from all the areas you will want to visit.
Where to Eat:
Breakfast/Brunch: Le Vespe Cafe is a zero-waste cafe located in Florence! This place really made my whole day. Their cappuccinos are amazing, too!
Dinner: Osteria dei Centopoveri is a Tuscan restaurant and pizzeria, so any budget will work here! Their pizza and calzones are huge and delicious, so you’ll definitely want to visit more than once! Make sure to order a bottle of local wine—you can score an entire bottle of Tuscan wine for only €15 and they’ll cork it for you to take home if you don’t finish it!
Gelato: If you don’t get gelato from Grom, were you even in Florence? It’s literally rated the best gelato in Florence, so, don’t miss out. (The best two-scoop mix is chocolate and grom flavor!)
Cocktails: Jazz Club Firenze is one of the top rated spots for drinks and vibes in Florence. Unfortunately, they were closed for holiday when we visited, but if you are in Florence when they are open, you’ve gotta stop by and tell us how it is!
What to Wear: Florence in the summer is quite warm! This is becoming an Italian trend, eh? If you’re exposing skin (which I recommend, because seriously, it’s HOT) lather up in sun-screen. From there, you can pretty much wear anything. Florence is a stylish city but what’s important is being comfortable, since you’ll be on foot all day.
Budgeting: Everything historic has a fee, including the Medici gardens. Unless you’re ready for a hot hike around the garden, skip it and climb to the top of the Duomo, see the Medici Villas, and visit the museums, instead. You’re looking at spending between €50-€100 per person for a day or two of historic venturing. Other inexpensive restuarants are around every corner, you just have to look for them!
MILAN
We were only in Milan for lunch since we passed through it on the way back to Switzerland, but our one suggestion is a good one.
Where to Eat: Do not leave Milan without visiting Lùbar! This is closer to the €€€ scale, since the plates are small, made to share, and they recommend ordering four or more per person. But, wow, the food and drinks are jaw-dropping good.
Okay, guys. That’s it! Did I miss anything? Is there anything you have questions about that you’d like more info on? Let’s chat! Shoot me a DM on Instagram at any time and let’s plan your next adventure!

So what happens when you land up in the capital of a country, which would have welcomed you with open arms had you not uttered those deadly words right at the onset: “Sorry, I don’t speak Italian!”Well, you will definitely be frowned at, ignored, unanswered or just be left on your own - which I am sure nobody would prefer in a vibrant space such as Italy.You can make sure to begin your conversation with at least “Scusi” (Excuse Me— formal) or with a minimal salutation like “Buongiorno” or “Buonasera”. Then, perhaps, you could proceed to tone down your actual question in English by using cue words in Italian, like “toilette” (Italians prefer the french word to their own “bagno” in reference to the washroom) “piazza” or “pizzeria” “ristorante”, so that the local Italian understands quickly what you are referring to.Don’t be afraid to use Italinglish: “scusi, where is “ristorante”?” or something even shorter: “Scusi, toilette?” which will be taken more into consideration than your English version.
Italians like being elaborate when they give directions, as for everything else in life. Be patient and say “Scusi, non parlo italiano!” (Sorry, but i don’t speak Italian!) which is a table turner. This will immediately make an average Italian rush to your help even if their English is not so good. You must not, however, ever point out to an Italian that their English is not up to the mark! Praise them if you must, criticize them never. And you never know, this might be a great start to a cross-border friendship.You see, Italians take an instant liking to you if you express any sort of interest in their culture and language; they are extremely protective, just like any culture where multiple languages and dialects are spoken, about their native tongue. You’d be surprised to know that some of their dialects are full fledged languages in themselves, and equally diverse are their traditions which vary greatly from north to south.
Having learnt and then having taught the language to Indians – I have had the possibility of meeting many Italians. And I have always felt they might have, a soft spot for India and Indians in general – because in a way they are as multi-hued as us and they relate to our cultural diversity. So for them an Indian with even a basic knowledge of their language comes across as someone very “figo” (an informal slang for “cool”)!
But that is true for anyone who lands in Italy with a basic knowledge of Italian – you’ll be befriended at the bar, at the ristorante, in the tassi, in the underground metropolitana, the autobus faster than you can imagine. Don’t be overwhelmed, and don’t shy away from engaging with each one as you go. The more you chat, the more you will enjoy this land of wonders.
One last advice: If you really want to enjoy your first, and many more trips to this architecturally and scenically beautiful space – you better have your hellos, thank yous and wows in order (“Ciao” “Grazie” and “Che Bello!”)!So with the first cultural contact established, hope you have a Buon Viaggio in Italia!

FOR weeks, a question had been nagging at my mind. What gives Italians their enormous self-belief while the rest of Europe is a festering mess of anxieties, neuroses and self-doubt?
It was not until just days before I was due to fly back to Australia after three-and-a-half weeks in Italy, while walking up the long driveway to our villa in Tuscany late one afternoon, that I finally understood what makes the country tick.
A month before we arrived, Italy’s leaders had been grappling to resolve one of the frequent political crises which have been a common thread in the nation’s postwar history.
And for most of our stay, the other giants of Europe — Germany, France, England, Spain, Russia — along with a host of minnows chased sport’s ultimate prize, the FIFA World Cup, while the Italians watched from afar, having failed to qualify.
Both events would be a severe test of a nation’s self-confidence, but the Italians seemed to take them in their stride.
These are testing times for Europeans, with a rise in xenophobic nationalism and risks of a splintering if the postwar consensus which has provided security and economic stability since the late-1940s.
Italy is no different, but its natives’ confidence and identity are unshakeable.
The most recent political crisis came after the March elections which resulted in a hung parliament which was only resolved on 1 June with the formation of a coalition between Matteo Salvini’s right-wing League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement led by Luigi Di Maio.
There were moments of farce in the lead up to the government being formed after president Sergio Mattarella rejected the coalition’s choice of Eurosceptic finance minister, and in turn its nominated prime minister Giuseppe Conte and instead directed Carlo Cottarelli to form a new government.
Five days later, on 1 June, after intense negotiations, Cotarelli, withdrew and the original choice, Conte, became prime minister.
Italian politics as usual, sniggered the rest of the world. But with their unshakeable self-belief, the Italians just shrugged their shoulders.
After all, just look at Britain, where the government is being torn apart by the hard and soft Brexit factions and the prime minister is looking more and more like a gormless puppet with each passing day; and the US, fast becoming a global pariah under the monstrous Trump. Or Australia, for that matter, where replacing a prime minister in the middle of their term in office has become a national blood sport.
It is the same with football. Once the shock had passed, Italians found another country or another player to root for, and the World Cup telecasts were the highest rating on record. They know the Azzuri will be back in the big league soon, and in the meantime they can point to the four stars on their national shirts, three more than the English, the last won just a dozen years ago. And didn’t the world’s best player, Cristiano Ronaldo, choose Juventus in the Italian Serie A for the next stage of his career?
Italians literally do not give a shit that you might think that their politics is a bit of a joke, that its byzantine bureaucracy is slow and frustrating, that their economy is riddled with nepotism and corruption, that the crumbling infrastructure is sometimes not much better than the third world, or that their cities are full of pollution caused by all those Vespas buzzing around and could do with a clean up.
Spend a few weeks in Italy, and you being to understand where this immense well of self-confidence, almost swagger, comes from.
It starts with their country’s gorgeous natural and built environment. Italians live on a peninsula of extremes: tiny villages perched on the edge of cliffs that plunge straight into crystal clear blue seas; exquisitely preserved centres of renaissance power; and modern cities where 2000-year-old Roman ruins are just part of the everyday backdrop. A country that can offer us both Venice and Naples, Cinque Terre and San Gimignano.
Indeed, there are days when you find yourself thinking that Italy is too good for the Italians. Do they care? Of course not — they get to live there all the time, while we are just passing through as envious tourists.
It’s the confidence that comes from knowing that your ancestors were conquering most of the known world and devising modern systems of politics, language and culture when others were still trying to work out how to invent the wheel.
And a millennium later, when others were still stuck in the dark ages, your ancestors were at it again, leading the European renaissance and leaving a legacy in art, architecture, commerce and literature that has yet to be surpassed.
It’s the confidence that comes from knowing that your ancient language forms the basis of how hundreds of millions of people speak today. It’s the confidence from knowing that your food, your clothes, the way you carry yourself, has spread to and is imitated in every corner of the world.
Is there any other culture — apart from Chinese — which has so successfully achieved global ubiquity as Italian culture, yet at the same time resisted homogenisation?
Every time we eat a slice of pizza, drink a cappuccino, slip into a Versace or Armani item of clothing, worship at a Catholic Church, or watch a television drama about the Mafia, we are unconsciously paying homage to Italy (for good or ill).
Perhaps Italy’s greatest export has been its people; it was the Italian disapora who were the foot soldiers of the peaceful cultural invasion that assures Italy of its place in the world, even as their mother country’s economic, political and military clout falls down the ladder.
And back in Italy, it is this knowledge that they have been the world’s greatest cultural colonisers that gives Italians their self-confidence.
While Italy’s other great European rivals — France, Germany and Britain — engage in public handwringing bouts of self-doubt and identity crises, the Italians maintain this solid belief in themselves.
Of course, Italy shed any serious empire-building ambitions long ago, about the time the barbarians set fire to ancient Rome. So unlike France or England, it never embarked on colonialism in the 18th or 19th centuries. Modern Britain and modern France have undoubtedly benefited from the cultural influences brought by migrants from their former colonial outposts — can you imagine London without the Indian or Jamaican communities, or Paris without its Algerian and Moroccan communities?
But it’s also undeniable that multiculturalism has brought its own tensions which have been exploited by the xenophobic right throughout Europe, but especially in Britain and France.
Italy, by contrast, still remains a much more monocultural nation, yet the recent election which brought the far right Salvini into government as Interior Minister has also brought a more sinister racist tone to Italian politics.
But it remains that if Italians suffer any anxiety about their national identity, it stems more from the centuries of rivalry between the sophisticated north and the sensual south. Remember that until less than 200 years ago, Italy was not a single nation, but a patchwork of small kingdoms and principalities, and uniting them remains an ongoing project.
My maternal grandparents came to Australia from the northern province of Friuli in the 1920s, but despite visiting Italy three previous times before this year, I have always had an ambivlence about my ancestry.
After this most recent visit, I still can’t say I feel Italian, nor has Italy become my favourite European destination. But at least I understand now what it is to be Italian.
*A note about the photograph at the top of this story: This photo was taken late in the afternoon at the corner of Via del Corso and Via Laurina in Rome, near the Piazza del Popolo. I spent a long period waiting for the right image to appear in my camera’s viewfinder and couldn’t believe my luck when this woman floated into the light. It was only later, on my computer, that I noticed that the man in the red shirt had wandered into frame at the exact moment I clicked the shutter. At first, I thought he’d ruined the photo, but on reflection, his plainness only enhances the ethereal beauty of the woman in the light, who looks as if she’s been transplanted from a Renaissance masterpiece.

When I embarked on my Italian wine journey nearly three years ago, I could have never imagined having to face a worldwide health crisis here in Italy, or anywhere, for that matter.
Rather than recount grave tales of the current quarantine situation, I wanted to share what I’ve only now realized my fellow Italian citizens have taught me.
It’s been said a million times before, but now, more than ever, we need to remember that we cannot predict or control every aspect of our lives. As an American, this is something I’ve found very hard to accept. Living amongst a population of people who contrastingly seem to embrace unpredictability, has shed a spotlight on my inability to do so.
From my first days working on a beautiful vineyard in central Italy, I wanted to know exactly what I’d be doing when. I’d inquire about lunchtime, dinner time, and my future tasks for the upcoming week, often met by quizzical and unspecific replies. “We’ll pause for lunch when we’re done with these rows”, pointing to an undefined plot of vines, or “when we pick enough Trebbiano for today,” the winemaker would tell me.
Gone were the days of living confined to my office calendar, handcuffed to the rigid meetings, scheduled a month or more in advance. Countless more examples in the Italian countryside, as well as in my current city of Bologna, reinforce that Italians innately embrace the present, instead of wasting time obsessing about the future.
This take-things-as-they-come mindset has proven very beneficial in combating hysteria and fear during these now uncertain times of Coronavirus. Italy and the majority of its people are not overly panicking about tomorrow or being frightened by media reports from abroad.
Despite exaggerated accounts, Italians are not hoarding groceries and fighting in stores, as I’ve witnessed with every prediction of 6 inches of snow in the U.S. They focus their energy on dealing with the day at hand, taking time to prepare for the next, but never forgetting to find a few minutes to laugh and be grateful to be alive.
Unless of course, we’re talking about a football (soccer) match, Italians have shown me that life is much more than a series of back-to-back competitions. In America, we are groomed for competition from birth — just look at the insanity surrounding pre-school admissions. Parents in many parts of the US are forced to apply for pre-school the moment their child is born, in fear of being left out in the cold once their child approaches school-age — 3 years later.
From elementary school through high school, the competition only increases with each passing year. Immense pressure is put on students to outperform one another, gain entry to the highest classes, most prestigious clubs, teams, and of course colleges. Pre-SATs, SATs, state proficiency exams, and class-rankings pit every student against each other, creating tremendous anxiety and comparisons amongst impressionable teenagers.
In the US, very rarely are students encouraged, or afforded the time, to help one another succeed. Instead, they are told to focus on grades, activities, transcripts and overall peer-group standing. Fierce competition for the few coveted spots at elite and popular universities drives an inordinate amount of stress and do-whatever-it-takes approach. Parents and students resort to insane, sometimes illegal, measures to gain advantages and excel above the next student. Only now, are people finally being held accountable for admissions cheating scandals.
This cut-throat competition and dog-eat-dog mentality does not permeate society in Italy or most parts of Western Europe. Many factors contribute to this of course, but one major reason is that most European universities are public and accessible to all citizens, for free, or very little money. It’s been truly eye-opening to see how much this one difference can affect a nation’s culture and mindset of its society.
In Italy, children and teenagers can grow up without the looming fear of college admissions hanging above their heads. I’d argue, this results in Italians being less individualistic and hostile towards one another, from an early age. Family values are emphasized instead of GPAs, and more time is spent cultivating relationships and passing on priceless traditions. Additionally, students generally dedicate more time to their passions, communities, and appreciation of the arts.
Consequently, many Italian adults have numerous “job titles”, such as a lawyer by day, cheesemaker by night. It’s also common for people to work across various industries, instead of being pigeonholed into one. The freedom that comes with guaranteed higher education creates more opportunities to become successful in a field of your choosing, rather than a field that can most-efficiently pay off $100k+ student debt — as is often the case in America.
While competition is, of course, healthy, especially in business, I think we Americans often forget that life itself is not a competition. We must strive for meaningful lives — not only aim for high test scores, job-titles, and bank accounts, simply to out-shine the next person.
Italy’s economy is far from perfect, however, living in this country during good times, and recent times of difficulty has proven to me that quality of life defines a country much more than its GDP. Italians have come together to face this crisis as a unified and optimistic society, something I’m very proud to be a part of, now, more than ever.
#Andràtuttobene — Everything will be alright.

February 13, 2013.
We finally felt ready to start our Europe tourist circuits since our kids have grown enough to be able to sustain the walking around and making use of the full days you spend on this wonderful vacationing continent. Italy and Switzerland combination is what we picked — one country full of history, culture, art and character while the other is one of the most endowed places by nature gods. They are next to each other in Europe so no long intra-continent travel was involved. After much research we decided to drive around Italy and use the train system in Switzerland. I thought that was a great choice and would highly recommend doing that.
We have been doing a whole lot of trips in Asia and in the Americas and so making reservations and planning this trip to Europe was a new experience. Help of experienced friends, internet booking sites and plenty of travel tips from people on Trip advisor was a big help. Things like booking entry into the St Mark’s Basilica beforehand, the use of skip the line tour booking for Vatican, staying in Lauterbrunnen instead of Interlaken, car seat requirements in Europe, making sure about Air conditioning & parking spaces in hotels, keeping passports & cash safe, and second class Swiss pass is good enough (no need for first class) were some very useful tips. Our experience with Emirates for Flights, and Booking.com for booking hotels was very good. For planning our itinerary we used a combination of Frommer’s and Trip advisor write-ups. I also downloaded Rick Martin’s audio guides for Rome, Vatican and Venice — this helped me plan our days better.
Emirates flies 3 times a day from Hyderabad and connects very well to all locations in Europe. So we took nice and comfortable Emirates flights and landed in Rome on July 13th. The immigration process was the quickest I have seen — literally open the passport on visa page and stamp it. The Baggage area seemed old & run down as compared to all the new Indian airports and we had a broken wheel for our duffle bag — not the greatest start. But the airport pick up service we had booked from our hotel Fiume was good and the lady driver was friendly, took us through the Ancient Rome scenic drive — and we had our first breath taking view of the Colosseum — it was late evening so it was lighted up and looked majestic.
Although it was about 10pm by the time we were checked in and settled in the room, we wanted to just get started. So took a map and asked for basic directions from the hotel desk and walked through beutiful Rome streets to Spanish Steps. So one tip is to stay in the city boundary in Rome and second it is incredibly safe & the city is alive till quite late in the night, 1am or so. We clicked a few snaps and then took a rickshaw ride to Trevi Fountain, where we had our first pizza / pasta dinner. The fountain itself was a beautiful site in the night and we just sat on the steps with lot of people around till quite late.
July 14th we had a 10:30 am booking with “What A Life Tours” company for the guided tour of Vatican and Sistine Chapel. We used a taxi to make sure we reach on time and I was a little worked up about the dress code for the Vatican — but it seems people take it casually and you just need to tie a stole or something around bare shoulders for the Sistine Chapel. One thing though, Vatican is just too crowded and it was really hot on the outside at this time of the year — I would suggest winter time as a better time to visit Rome overall. Vatican is so full of the art treasures of the world, and it is so interesting to hear about how each Pope had a different approach to leaving their mark on the Vatican. Picture clicking were not allowed in Sistine Chapel but Michelangelo’s work is amazing with the imagination, the painting itself, the fact that this was done standing with utmost care using plaster art in 1508–12, simply awesome. And then St. Peter’s Basilica reminded of so many movies shot in this area both inside and the square outside — the shape of the church as a Cross, the holy Door, Michelangelo as an architect showing up strongly in the Dome and in his work Pieta (Mary with Jesus on her lap) were moving sites for me. The older walls, the air ducts, and the tombs underneath the basilica are a must see. Our guide Ana was great, energetic and interesting, in fact we paid extra to continue with her for the tour of the St. Peter’s Basilica. We had some really nice fresh pizza lunch sitting on a mat on the steps of the shop just outside Vatican and took a bus for Trastevere.
Trastevere is the areas south of the Vatican and means “beyond the Tiber” river. This is one of the most charming area of Rome with narrow medieval lanes, restaurants and just beautiful to walk around. Lot of picture perfect corners and buildings. We just strolled around the area and thoroughly enjoyed the leisurely time. We took a bus back to the hotel from across the river. But we were still not done — I read on the internet that night time Colosseum is beautiful so we took a bus to the ancient marvel of a building. It was nice, few pictures and sitting in the cool breeze for some time was good. This was a tough day for the kids because of all the walking in Vatican but they held well to my surprise, we did use stroller for the younger one.
Ancient Rome was the plan for the next day. We had breakfast at the hotel and reached Colosseum early at its opening time. The queues were already building up. One of the tips we had was to go the Forums first and buy the ticket there as it is the same ticket that is used for Colosseum. But we did not do it as I really wanted to get inside Colosseum early while it was not hot and spend time there — I will admit that I was mesmerized by this structure and that is why you can notice that I have already mentioned this building several times in this post. What we did was we took one audio / video guide for me, this was a separate line with almost zero waiting time to get in for this — this is probably the perfect way to beat the queue. I am a history enthusiast and to feel what it would have been inside this building 2000 years ago was breathtaking. In fact my wife and my elder daughter also enjoyed the structure as much as I did. For me, it was one of the high points of our trip and we did click a whole lot of pictures. From here, we went to the Forum’s where I used Rick Martin’s walking tour. It was really hot at this time and very tiring for the kids — so we rushed it a bit and focused only on some of the high point’s like the Arch of Constantine outside the forums, house of Vestal Virgins, Arch of Septimius Severus, place of Caesar’s murder. The view from the street of the Markets to Trajan was really nice. This part of Rome warranties a multi-day visit for a history student and perhaps in a cooler weather.
After lunch we walked to the Pantheon, another massive architectural marvel. From there onto the Piazza Navona. This is a beautiful square with lots of artists displaying their work, we bought some really nice paintings here and had one of the several rounds of gelato while in Italy. Rest a while in many of the beautiful squares, get water from the fountains, and walk the streets was the order of the day. We walked right up to Spanish mountains passing through the street with all the well-known big brand showrooms. We spent the evening at Villa Borghese park, a nice break from all the city walking for kids to have some fun. We rented a self-driven rickshaw type thing, rode a Segway for the first time, and dipped our feet in cool fountain water.
Next day started our road trip around Italy. We picked up our pre-booked car from Hertz on the train station. It took us almost 3 hours to pick up the car (frustrating), the GPS we took did not work, and consequently we got lost in Rome for couple of hours. Finally for rest of the trip the age old method of asking when lost and having printed directions is what we did to find our way around. We drove first to Sienna, and stayed in a beautiful chalet. The place we stayed in itself was a 2 floor room with a kitchenette, with olive garden setting and a small pool overlooking the hills. The COOP grocery store was nearby, so we went shopping there and that night cooked sumptuous rajma chawal with cherries to top it all. A nice glass of Chianti wine with the meal was a big plus. The town itself was a really beautiful little place with narrow walkways with incredible medieval buildings. The long combination escalator to go from the foot hills to the town was an experience in itself. The weather was a welcome cool one and we stayed till quite late in the town. The Piazza del Campo, site for annual horse racing event was impressive with lots of people just sitting and lying down in the square on its slating floors.
Our plan to drive through the Chianti area was another high point of the trip. We small winding roads, beautiful hills, occasional medieval time buildings atop the hills, farms around us were breathtaking. We stopped over in a village, Chianti village Castillina, which looked like right out of a movie set. We reached Pisa by the afternoon and here we stayed in a hotel right in the center of the town next to the leaning tower. So we got to spend our entire stay looking and walking around the famous monument. Overall, I thought Pisa was disappointing. The tower itself is not really impressive and the town itself is nothing to write home about. One could easily pass it without missing a bit of the Italy experience. We had decided to skip Florence this time because of kids. We saved it for our second Italy trip :-), maybe without the kids that time.
Drive to Venice was uneventful and efficient as i was quite use tod riving in Italy by now. Here there was another smart thing I learned from trip advisor write ups — we stayed in Mestre — better hotels, enough parking and literally 10 mins from Venice across the ocean bridge. I would say that is the smartest thing to do if you are driving and/ or are with kids and need more spacious room. Venice is romantic, enchanting and it did not feel like leaving the city even after just roaming around for 6–7 hours. The best things to do are to take the Grand Canal ride in vaporetto (water taxi) and then just get lost in the streets of Venice. The mask shops, the small bakeries, the gelato shops were all quite an experience. We had also happen to attend a fund raising music concert in one of the squares which was nice. The gondola ride is ridiculously expensive and a waste of time & money. The main tourist spot St. Mark’s square and Basilica are nice but very crowded until 5pm when the cruise ships leave. For the basilica, it is best to pre-book the entry time online. We were also told that the food here is bad and expensive, but we felt that if you do not want to get very fancy then it is not that bad. Overall, nothing compares to the unique experience of this city.
Onto to Switzerland. We were to spend 9 days in Switzerland and the plan was to start from Geneva with stays in Montreux, Interlaken and Lucerne; and fly out of Zurich. I did not get any good advice on how to get from Venice to Geneva / Montreux. The flights were expensive and not used normally, the direct train is no longer available and wastes a lot of time. I decided to drive the good 600 Kms and drop the car off at Geneva airport. I had lots of apprehensions about this long drive but it turned out to be a great decision. The Italy highway part was fast and then the drive through France, through Mt. Blanc area, was a beautiful drive. We dropped off the car at Geneva airport and took the train around Geneva Lake to Montreux. Before you start using the Swiss pass it needs to be validated at the station but after that it works like a charm. The SBB train system is great.
Montreux is a small city on the other side of Lake Geneva. The lake side walk, small sections for kids to play in the lake itself and view of the mountains is breathtaking. We had our taste of some decent middle eastern food also here. We slept early and next day morning on July 20th we had reservations for a whole day excursion on “Chocolate Train” from Golden Pass train system. I had done these booking on internet beforehand itself but the ticket seemed to be easily available. This tour had mixed reviews but we decided to do for kids, they can have fun as this included visits to a cheese factory and a chocolate factory. I would say that if you are spending enough time in Switzerland then it is not bad at all as one gets to experience internal Switzerland at leisure without too much planning. Kids were excited about the 2 factory visits with unlimited chocolate eating, and the village Gruyeres was postcard beautiful. One can smell the cows and the valley views were amazing. Evening we spent more time at the lake and got ready to leave early morning.
Montreux — Interlaken — Lucerne part is narrow gauge and serviced by golden pass trains. The Swiss pass works just fine, if you want you could do online reservations for extra money but we did not need it. Two tips — find out the time for the Panorama trains as they have the large glass windows for better views; and second not reserving is better as you can sit anywhere without looking for your reserved seats throughout the train. The train ride to Interlaken OST was beautiful and from there we took connecting 20 mins train to Lauterbrunnen. Here although the hotel was just a 3 mins walking distance, one thing we found out was that the shops closes down by 6ish, secondly we reached by 2 but our hotel reception was closed till 4 — now it may just be our hotel but this was indeed odd. Also, the hotel owner was a unco-operative guy and picked fights with lot of guests. Swiss hotels are expensive, with small rooms and limited service in general. We did find a restaurant next to our hotel though which served some great vegetarian food — homemade kind of burger, nice pizza and even had some Indian curry dishes. The information center was very very useful, answered all our questions, helped us plan our outings, gave us good weather information to decide where to go on which days.
Lauterbrunnen was like a “seven star hill station” in my wife’s words. Small village with one main street with all the hotels, view of the snowcapped Jungfrau ranges, waterfalls around the village were all beautiful site. It was a pleasantly cold here after the rather hot Italy weather. We hiked up one of the hills for a view from behind the waterfalls. It was raining for most of the evening and probably snowing up in the mountains. So we planned for Jungfrau the next day, as weather would be clearer and we might see some fresh snow. Now this one was another amazing experience — the train system itself is amazing going up such a height, the way the crowd is handled is efficient and the Jungfrau station set up is nicely organized. As expected there was nice fresh snow and kids had a blast playing in the snow — making snow man, and doing the tubing & sledging for more than 3 hours. We over packed our coats, it was not that cold — what is really needed is the right shoes, gloves, sunscreen of course sun glasses. The ice cave was nicely done too.
We spent 2 more days here in Lauterbrunnen and thoroughly enjoyed them with a great Alps experience. One day we took a cruise in Lake Thun, roamed around in Thun and Interlaken. Interlaken and in several places in Switzerland one can also do para gliding, we decided to skip it though. We were dying for Indian food and so this was the day we had a great meal at Taj Mahal restaurant in Interlaken. In Thun, we also discovered that McDonalds in Switzerland serves the Veggie burger similar to India — kids just loved that and that was our savior for kids over next few days in Switzerland. Second day we went to Mt. Murren and then to Grendelwald where we took the long cable car to First. Here the facilities for skiers in winters, and hikers in summers is great, we enjoyed some hiking, thoroughly soaked into the breath taking views of the valley and then kids had a great time in a play area at this high altitude. Another note on food — as our hotel did not serve breakfast — we used COOPS a lot. We bought nice bread, olives, dips, fruits & vegetables and made sandwiches which the kids loved. All of us were kind of getting bored of the regular breakfast items in restaurants so this was good change.
July 25th we reached Lucerne, which turned out to be a surprisingly large city. We stayed right at the edge of the “old city”. Walking around in this area was very enjoyable with lot of window and actual shopping. We visited the Natural History museum which was OK and the spent time around the canal which had beautiful flower arrangements on the 2 wooden bridges. It turned out that this was also the time for the annual “Blue Bells” music festival. The late evenings when the shops were closed the festival was at its full bloom with number of temporary street shops around the lake, live performances and just so many people having fun. There were very few kids as lot of smoking and drinking was going on. There were food stalls from every part of the world — people were just having a very good time. For our second day we took the train to Engelberg and went up the famous Mt Titlis. We wanted to make sure we did not miss it as this is part of the itinerary for all tours from India, though knowledgeable folks had told us that it would be same as Jungfrau. It was same — but only not as good. The glacier seems to be receding fast, the snow itself was not as pure and soft, the ice cave was a disappointment — but it did not stop the kids from having fun on the snow sledges and had couple of hours of good time. Engelberg on the foothills is a nice quite town and we spent some leisure time along the stream which seemed like a natural flow of water. On 27th, we took our direct train to Zurich airport and flew back to Hyderabad, completing a long awaited and incredibly enjoyable trip.
But before I finish I want to talk about a lot of interesting and delightful findings for us. No one told us about them, neither were they mentioned on the travel sites or books. For one, the ever running water fountains which had perfectly drinkable water was amazing. At first when we saw people filling their water bottles from the fountain at Spanish Steps in Rome we were surprised, and so we asked around and asked at our hotel, as well as the guide at the Vatican Museums to be doubly sure. After that we used it to the full — cool, clean water and free :-). Another very nice concept we saw especially in Switzerland was a COOP store outside of all the railway stations, easy to find and best place to get stuff for a quick snack or making your own sandwich or getting some nice fresh fruits to carry around for kids. Everyone must use them whenever they travel to this part of the world.
The way Swiss pass with a free family card worked for us was also beyond my expectations. Firstly the train network & punctuality in Switzerland is amazing and one needs to experience it to believe it. Lot of people told us about it but still i was positively surprised. Then the coverage on the pass with museums, buses, cruises, discounts on excursions — it was completely worth every penny.
I really should also mention the highways system between cities in Italy. It was again in some ways probably even better than what I saw in US. The “Autostrade” and the state highway network, Strade Statal, abbreviated SS, was great where one could drive at 130Km/h safely and without hassles. Trucks and slow moving vehicles stick to the right lane and if you do not then the guy wanting to overtake you would be touching you bumper at the back literally at that high speed :-), fairly effective system huh. What is more, never did I find a cop lurking around to catch you for smallest of violations. Italians are truly kings on the road :-).
And then the unique architectures. Italy had these medieval time cobble streets with vertical 3 or 4 floor or so buildings right next to each other in almost every city. The doors to these buildings would be massive wooden ones with big bolts and operated using electronic systems. We kept peeping into them and guessed about the insides of these buildings until finally we stayed in one such building in Pisa — our hotel was really an apartment in a building like this. Switzerland on the other had had these beautiful 2 floor buildings with hut shape tops. The Windows almost always had a false door of wood on the outside (or so it seemed), with a simple grill and flower arrangements on the ledge. It looked really pretty.
Now for the things that did not go so well. Firstly, the rental car process, things are really not as smooth or transparent as one would find in the US. It was not clear that if I picked up the car in Rome and dropped in Geneva, there would be about Euro 370 extra charges — that is quite a bit of money and I found out only after the charges showed up on my credit card. And then this was my first time driving in Europe and I was relying on my GPS to work, it just did not and it seems it is a routine issue as no one at the rental car company was surprised when I reported that. Also, they could not fix the problem when i visited the agency again. Then there was the issue of drive from Venice to Geneva I had to cross country borders twice, to pass through France, and that meant I had to pay the Euro 40 charges twice. It really should have something like a one day validity.
We are all vegetarians and were told horror stories of lack of food options for us. But we do love Italian food, Pizza and Pasta, so I was fairly confident that we would be fine. We carried some Indian spiced up snacks so we could take care of once in a while cravings and also carried few boxes of Cup-O-Noodles for kids just in case they did not get adjusted to the food types. But things worked out fine. There were enough vegetarian options on the typical roadside European restaurants and also Gelato was a of course a big hit. Towards the end of the trip we did start missing the Indian spices so we looked up Taj Mahal Restaurant in Interlaken as I already mentioned, and it was great. And once again doing groceries in COOP and then making our own Sandwiches was an option we used more than once, and loved it.
I would say a truly memorable vacation. Europe is beautiful, clean and very touristy as well as provides options to find your own style of spending your precious vacation time.

We’ve learned to enjoy the “hub and spoke” approach to travel. We pick a hub town to stay several days and then plan day trips out from there. That way, we immerse ourselves in one location and aren’t moving every other day. This style of travel provides a more comfortable, relaxed pace.
A good hub is an interesting town located in the center of an area with sights around it. You’re looking for a spot that allows you easy day trips to other locations. We picked general areas and then zoomed in to look for interesting Airbnb possibilities.
We’ll land in Venice at Marco Polo Airport and take a shuttle to the rental car place. I used Kayak to find quotes and make a reservation. We didn’t need a big car (and good luck driving one on tiny European roads anyway). Plus, gas is expensive. I’ve read Italian drivers are intense but at least we’ll be on the familiar side of the road. If we can drive in Ireland, we can drive anywhere.
We’ll do a counter-clockwise circuit through northern and central Italy beginning in the hill town of Feltre. That will provide us a base to explore the Dolomites in the Italian Alps. Then we’ll head west to Torno on Lake Como and south to the Cinque Terre on the Mediterranean. We’ll then go southeast into Tuscany to a village near Siena before finishing for a week back in Venice.
We’ve used Airbnb to stay in unique homes across Germany, Ireland and the US. Often, the prices are much lower than hotels, especially as you add more people. Plus, you get a whole place to yourself, lots of privacy, more bathrooms and a kitchen for cooking. Most importantly, you’re more integrated into the everyday life of the place you’re visiting.
We use search filters to specify we’re looking to rent an entire place plus request key amenities like Wifi, washing machine and the number of beds/baths we need. The calendar for each place shows availability.
You can rate and review places you’ve stayed. You’re also rated by the renters as a guest. It’s a self-monitoring system similar to eBay. You converse with the owner directly and can negotiate the price, especially if you stay multiple days (another reason to hub and spoke your trip).
The village of Feltre in the Veneto is our first hub. It’s located about an hour-and-a-half drive north of Venice with the Dolomites serving as a dramatic backdrop. The plan is to explore the mountains and nearby towns like Bassano Del Grappa and Trento.
After three nights in Feltre, we’ll meander west along the mountains to the lake district. We’ll stay for a week in an old villa along Lake Como in the village of Torno. Along with the lakeside towns of Bellagio and Como, we’ll plan on making day trips to Milan, Mantua and Bergamo.
Here’s an example of how we used Airbnb to find our place in Torno. We wanted to stay around the lake and used the map feature. Once you zoom in on specific homes/apartments, you can view photos and research the area.
Yes, that looks pretty good! After a week around the lake, we’ll then head south toward the Ligurian coast on the Mediterranean for three days.
Cinque Terre is a string of five centuries-old villages featuring colorful houses and vineyards clinging to the rugged coastline. We’re looking forward to riding the slow train that connects each of the towns and then exploring from the sea by taking the boat service.
After our stay along the sea, we’ll head inland to the heart of Tuscany. We found a villa in the middle of vineyards roughly 30 minutes west of Siena. This will provide us a base to explore large sights like Florence, Pisa and Lucca as well as smaller Tuscan hill towns like Monteriggioni, Pistoia and Civita.
Here’s how I used Google Maps to tag interesting “spoke” sights around our five hubs locations. We’re not planning on visiting this many places but it gives me a good list from which to choose once we’re in Italy. I color-coded sights by hub. With my Google Map on the cloud, I can pull this up while on the road and we can explore. This is where pre-trip research is key.
For example, we’re planning on visiting Arezzo to the east of Siena to take in a big market held on the first weekend in October. I tagged the location and we should be able to find it with minimal trouble.
We’ll wrap up our Italian tour with a week in Venice. We found an Airbnb in a quieter, less-touristed sestiere (neighborhood). I’m looking forward to having time to just explore. Early mornings and late evenings this time of year should be much less crowded. I’m not sure you can ever soak in enough Venice.
My next post should be from Italy on Thursday if the Wifi situation cooperates. Until then, arrivederci!

I hope this update finds you well.
I’ve been back from Italy for about six weeks and am still in the process of digesting all my learning from my trip. It was a fantastic experience, and I’m glad to have had my first international experience.
I will continue to update this article with photos from different days of the trip as time goes on. Nevertheless, I wanted to publish this partially completed version so as to ensure it doesn’t end up in my drafts, never to be shared with the world.
Enjoy this post,
Josh

THE TRAVEL PLANS
The plan was to visit Italy for just over three weeks, with a few days at Rome prior to joining a Tour of Italy for two weeks, with a return to Rome for an extra six or so days at the end of the tour.
We completed the Italy’s best tour with Cosmos. The tour in our trip saw us complete the following:

TAKING A TRAVEL JOURNAL
I decided to take a travel journal to reflect both on my learning, and also to collect receipts, business cards, postcards, holy cards and other trinkets as I toured the country. All in all, I ended up with so much stuff I had to pack all the material collected separately, but there was a lot of value in journalling.
The travel journal I used was made by Typo and can be purchased here:

Whilst I didn’t use all of the sections on this tour, I did make use of the following sections:
What follows is my notes from the notes, daily adventures, things I learnt along the way, and second notes sections. I have interspersed photos, post-travel commentary and other relevant pieces of information to make these more useful for future reference.

29/06/16
We’re leaving tomorrow morning. I’m starting to pack and get things ready now, following my usual, last minute routine.
I’m looking forward to heading off, and am glad to finally be on holidays from work.
Requests to complete for people while I’m away:
Post-travel note: I made a video for each of these requests on my iPhone and sent them to the people concerned before I returned home.

01/07/16
My first ever view of an international country (Hong Kong) from a plane.
We’ve survived our trip from Australia to Hong Kong. Shortly we will be boarding our second flight, which will take us to Rome.
I’ve followed Courtney’s advice and kept awake thus far. If I can push myself a few hours more and then sleep on the plane I should be close to achieving Rome’s time with my body clock.
I purchased a 500 ml Coke whilst here, which cost 28 Hong Kong dollars. There was a girl here who unrolled her yoga mat and proceeded to do a lot of poses… I was amazed by her flexibility. I have contacted Vanessa.
Whilst on the plane I watched:
I had chicken and rice and nearly choked on an asparagus-like vegetable. I also had pork noodles, which were nice.
Praise God for this wonderful opportunity.
******
01/07/16
I’m on the plane and we are a few hours from landing in Rome. Sleep has been nearly impossible on this plane, so I’m going to be suffering from jet lag when we arrive.
So far the food on this flight hasn’t been as good as the prior one. Nevertheless, things are more exciting now.
I watched the movie for ‘the Entourage’ on this flight, read some more of ‘The Imitation of Christ’, completed this journal entry and tried to sleep, albeit unsuccessfully.
At Rome:
We went to our accommodation and checked in our bags, as we can’t access our room until 2:00pm. From there, we checked out the Pantheon, the St. Ignatius Church (photos of the roof below), some other churches and Trevi Fountain.
We had lunch @ Vacanza Romana. First impression of Italian Pizzas is that D.O.C. in Australia is very authentic.
Also, my rosary broke but I seem to have been able to fix it.
We went for a walk again later in the day. Whilst doing this, we stumbled upon a Mass, where I went up for a blessing from the priest. Prior to that, we had Galati from a place at Trevi Fountain, which was amazing.
We also checked out some Roman ruins at the end of our hotel’s street earlier in the day.

DAILY ADVENTURES
The weather was: Sunny
Day / date: 01/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Land, check-in, get food and rest, and see some sites.
My daily adventures: See earlier notes for info on today.
We also picked up some water from a Marian fountain; I’ve consumed most of it though.
I’m also impressed with the number of drinking fountains in Rome that are free to use, and the quality of the water that comes from these. Apparently there are 1300+ in Rome, which is really impressive.
My desire to learn Latin has substantially increased.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 02/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Revisit some Churches, visit the Colosseum, Colosseum night tour, and take photos, Trastavere, look for gifts.
My daily adventures: We went to the Roman Forum, which was spectacular! We stumbled upon an ancient Marian Church that is on display there until September. We got a lot of photos, so that was exceptionally well timed.
The Colosseum was fascinating, and it was incredible to tick it off the bucket list. The night tour of it was even more exceptional. Pizza from the corner shop was okay but not the best. Really cheap though. At the Colosseum, we met an Australian woman who said she thought that the Italians lived in a museum. I thought she was pretty accurate with that comment.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 03/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia and Vatican City
Plans for the Day: Attend Mass, visit the Vatican, Check out of hotel, join and commence our two-week tour.
My daily adventures: Went to Vatican, St Peter’s Square. Bought 300 Euro odd-dollars’ worth of Rosaries, etc. which we had blessed in the Papal blessing. Moved to the new hotel. It has a bigger room but has a less comfortable bed. We met our Tour Director (Lambros in Gk. or Alex in Italian) then Mum and I went and had chips and lasagne (which was beautiful) at a local Italian restaurant that her and Courtney had eaten at year’s prior.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 04/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Sistine Chapel, St Peter’s Basilica, Roman Forum, Colosseum, Dinner.
My daily adventures: This was our first day with the tour.
Sistine Chapel — amazing! We will definitely need to revisit this & St. Peter’s basilica to spend more time taking it in. The tour guide was great, but I felt we didn’t get as much time in the Colosseum and Forum as was necessary. I was very grateful we had visited them previously. Dinner was good, consisting of bruschetta, pasta with peas, lasagne, chicken and potatoes, then gelato and coffee.
I’m not sure how these places are able to make a profit, so I assume it is through bulk cooking that they are able to do so. Dinner was accompanied by a flute player and a guitarist, which was nice.
P.s. Today we also met our bus drive Pino.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / day: Tuesday 05/07/16
Destination: Roma, Pisa, Montecatini — Italia
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
On our way from Rome I felt really sick from the bus motion. Consequently I loaded up on my travel tables. As of lunchtime (now), I’m in a medically induced tiredness. We then went to Pisa and saw the leaning tower. Lunch was pizza and biscotti from some street shops. We opted to check out the Cathedral, Baptistery and the cemetery rather than climb the tower. I tried European Maccas there. We had dinner @ Montecatini at a local winery / olive oil farm. The food and wine were delicious and we had great company.
******
The weather was: Sunny with clouds
Day / date: 06/07/2016 — Wednesday
Destination: Florence, Italia
Plans for the day: visit Florence
My daily adventures:
We went to Florence today and got to do a tour with a local guide. From there we went to a local market sitting on a bridge. There is lots of jewellery and leather in Florence, but it is expensive. The highlight of the day for me was paying 15 Euro to go to the Cathedral, baptistery and Museum. We saw some relics, etc. Back at Montecatini, we went to the Funicular and then had dinner at the hotel. I then had a few drinks at the bar.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 07/07/16
Destination: La spezia, cinque terre, Levanto, Genoa, Italia
Plans for the day: Have pesto, check out local village markets, possibly visit the beach, go somewhere nice for dinner
My daily adventures: Today we went to la spezia to catch a train to the cinque terre. Whilst there we visited Vernazza and Monterosso. At Vernazza I looked at the Church, went up to the tower and walked around. At Monterosso we walked around the old section, had pesto @ Ristorante ‘Da Ely” and I ought a beach towel for 10 Euro. We then caught a train to Levanto, where our bus took us to our accommodation in Genoa, a nice, four star hotel. We then went to dinner at a place recommended by our tour Director Lambros, but I didn’t think it was that great.
******
The weather was: Sunny with clouds, cloudy
Day / date: 08/07/2016
Destination: Genoa, Milan, Lake Maggiore, Italia
Plans for the day: as above, with tour dinner
My daily adventures: We had a tour of Genoa with a local guide. They were very knowledgeable, but I didn’t find Genoa as impressive as some of the other locations we have visited. From there, we drove to Milan. I checked out the Cathedral, had Maccas for lunch, bought some Galati and visited the local shops. We then went to Lake Maggiore. We’re staying in a nice hotel here, although we had to get the bed adjusted from a double to a twin share. We had dinner on a nearby island as part of the tour, sitting with two Australia couples.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 09/07/2016
Destination: Lugano, Switzerland
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: We took the bus from Lake Maggiore to Lugano, crossing the boarder into Switzerland. From there, we went to Monte Tamaro, where we had some lunch and got to see an amazing view. To do this, we had to catch a chair lift up and back. After this, we came back to the hotel.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 10/11/2016
Destination: Verona and Venice, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: we left our hotel and went to Verona, where we had a tour of the place and got to touch the boob of the statue of Juliet. We had lunch there and I had really nice pasta. From there, we drove to our hotel near Venice. At night, we went to dinner in Venice and had a quick look around. The food wasn’t too great (in my humble opinion) but Venice was beautiful.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 11/07/2016
Destination: Venice, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
We went to Venice via boat again. After finding some people in our group that got separated from the group, we did a gondola ride, which was stunning. After that, we went and got a replacement earring for Julie, before getting lunch. I had pasta and a 500ml bottle of Chianti to myself, which left me a little drunk for the afternoon. We didn’t get to see inside St. Mark’s Basilica, but we were able to see other churches, including S. Giovanni Basilica. We had some ice cream, looked at shops, went back to the hotel and had dinner with some Spanish and NZ friends.
******
The weather was: Sunny (Assisi) Cloudy (Ravenna)
Day / date: 12/07/2016
Destination: Ravenna and Assisi (Dante’s tomb is in Ravenna)
Plans for the day: Drop off Mirtza’s prayer in Assisi. Visit the Basilica.
My daily adventures: On the way to Ravenna we saw the longest river in Italy (650 km) and the church where the musical scale was invented. At Ravenna, we visited the Arian baptistery and the Church of St. Francis, along with Dante’s sepulchre. On the way to Assisi, we stopped for lunch and had a lasagne. At Assisi, we visited the Basilica, which was amazing! Three churches on top of one another! We bought some things at the gift shop and then headed over to our hotel in Perugia for the evening, where we had dinner.
“This is a beautiful country.” (My reflection in the margin at 3:15pm on bus in rural area on the way to Assisi)
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 13/07/2016 — Wednesday
Destination: Pompeii
Plans for the day: visit Pompeii, survive the long bus ride.
My daily adventures: We left our hotel early this morning to drive to Pompeii, then Sorrento. On the way we watched a movie, ‘My life in ruins’ (a comedy allegedly w/ Tom Hanks as the producer about tours). When we got to Pompeii, I had some Pasta, bought some post cards and a booklet on the place. We then took a tour of part of Pompeii, which is so impressive! We arrived at Sorrento about 5:00pm.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 14/07/2016
Destination: Capri, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: We went on a ferry to Capri. Unfortunately, I was sick on the way over and on the bus after. This caused me to miss the chair lift. Afterwards, we went to a Museum and had lunch, followed by a walk to some scenic spots and a ride on the funicular. We headed back to the hotel for a nice buffet and went for a walk with some friends through Sorrento, stopping at a wine bar for a drink.
******
The weather was: raining
Day/date: 15/07/2016
Destination: Positano, then Rome
Plans for the day: Visit Positano, get to Rome, wash clothes for tomorrow.
My daily adventures: We caught a bus to Positano, where it was raining. This is the only day so far that it has been raining whilst we have been on tour. We checked out Santa Maria Assunta Esan Vito whilst there. From there, we made our way back to Rome, only stopping briefly at two places to get some food and to have a toilet stop, because traffic jams caused us some delays. The dinner was a bit disappointing, but the company was nice with a brief tour on the bus following at night, along with a stop over at Trevi Fountain.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 16/07/2016
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Move hotels, make our plans for the rest of the week, get a nice lunch / dinner, go site seeing.
My daily adventures: We had breakfast with our kiwi friends prior to moving to our old hotel. 140 Euro a night to sleep on a couch, as Mum had the bed. Anyway, we went and checked out the temples of portuna and Hercules, the mouth of truth and related basilica, another church and basilica, picked up some holy water, crucifix and prayer card, ate pizza and Maccas, washed clothes. I bought a guide to the pantheon (which we revisited) and read it, and also bought a bottle of cheap Chianti for consumption prior to the trip home.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 17/07/2016
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Mass @ Pantheon, visit catacombs
My daily adventures: Today we went to Mass @ the Pantheon. This was cool, as they turned on all the lights and cleared the tourists out for it. There were only 18 or so people 5 minutes beforehand, but it ended up with about 100 or so. From there, we met up with Anita & Ryan after lunch and walked to the catacombs. These were so impressive, and definitely worth the 8 Euro to get in. After this, we bought some pizza and had it on our hotel’s rooftop.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 18/07/2016
Destination:
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
We had a much needed and well-deserved sleep in and low start to the day. We then walked to Trastavere, and had a look around (although there was not much to see). Afterward, we walked to Castel Sant Angelo, and paid to walk around inside. It was quire impressive, but left me pondering why Pope Paul III had a room decorated about the pagan god Apollo. After relaxing, we went hunting for an ATM that worked and then had a nice dinner a few blocks behind the Pantheon.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 19/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Shopping for gifts for family, friends and myself
My daily adventures: We spent most of today looking around to buy bits and pieces for family and friends, then we found a really nice place for dinner.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 20/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Visit Michelangelo’s Moses
My daily adventures: I went to Santa Maria Maggiore, Santo Pietro in Vincoli, St John Lateran and the Santa Scala. We had lunch near the Colosseum, which is probably the worst lunch I’ve had during my time here. Consequently, we had sinner @ the same place as the night before. I started coming down sick today.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day/date: 21/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: Today I was unwell. Consequently, our original plans to visit St Paulo outside the walls did not occur. We’ve had a pretty laid back day today. I have purchased a backpack to take my trinkets and gifts for people home in.

Revisiting Romans 9
One of the religious topics I have most disputed in the last few years is, ‘Does God love all men?’ Historically, I have said no on the basis of Romans chapter 9.
After hearing a sermon on 1 Timothy 2:4 (God desires all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth), I knew I could not accept an understanding that requires two wills in God or the verse to be interpreted to mean, ‘all elect men’, not ‘all men’.
The only section for which I had not been able to come to a reasonable conclusion about was this section in Romans 9, particularly:
Material consulted during the process included:
I understood the Calvinist position well, but was unable to understand the Catholic position on this scripture. They are not quite Calvinistic, Lutheran or Arminian. Nevertheless, a sermon by Adrian Rogers (not Catholic) helped me along with various writings of Thomas Aquinas (summa theologica and his notes on Romans) to finally see how people with other paradigms hold their position.
This position seems to me to make better sense of the particular text, of the scriptures as a whole, and of the Catholic position. Consequently, this post constitutes a retraction of my former position (unless it can be sufficiently demonstrated otherwise that this position is wrong).
The sermon by Adrian Rogers was as follows:

We just came back from an amazing week long trip to Italy with kids. We enjoyed great weather — it was 50–60 degrees in December, great scenery and of course delicious food.
Since I am a massive travel nerd, and we have seven people traveling, I planned everything down to a minute. It took quite a bit of time to prepare for the trip, but it was definitely worth it. Huge thanks to Joanne Wilson who gave me pointers and linked me to her post about trip to Rome.
We booked Airbnb, on via Panisperna, next to Colosseum, found an AWESOME tour guide, reserved restaurants for dinner, and bought the tickets for train and museums in advance.
Arrive Rome 12:35PM, settle in apt by 3PM
Lunch: Antico Bakery, via dei Shiavari 54
Evening: Walk around Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps
Dinner: Re-cafe, Piazza Augusto imperatore, 36
We arrived at noon and boarded a van that was ordered for us by our Airbnb host. The ride was about 30 minutes and cost €80.
We settled in our apartment on via Panisperna, which was right by St. Maria Maggiore, Termini and a Colosseum. The apartment was quirky and fun. Bathroom decorations stood out.
After unpacking we needed to grab food. We headed to the famous Antico bakery for lunch. Unfortunately it was closed due to St Stephane holiday and we went to Alice pizza instead. Alice is a popular chain that makes small, thin, square pizzas of different kinds. It’s actually really good.
After lunch we headed to Trevi Fountain to enjoy, and take pictures. It was very crowded, but kids really liked it. A few blocks from Trevi fountain we found gelato San Crispino, which was on our top 10 gelato places. It was pretty amazing, especially banana, and apple flavors.
We then headed to Spanish Steps. The area was bustling and festive. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the lights. We claimed the steps all the way up and took a bunch of pictures.
After Spanish Steps we went for dinner at Re-caffe. The service was slow and inattentive, but the food was pretty good.
Morning: Colosseum and Ancient Forum
Lunch: Trieste, via Urbana 112
Afternoon: Fountains of Rome tour, Campo Di Fiori
Dinner: Cul De Sac, Piazza di Pasquino 73
We woke up early and headed to a local breakfast place. We stumbled upon La Licata — an awesome place that had variety of croissants and sandwiches including vegan, and glutton free. Coffee was great too. Right after breakfast we took 5 min walk to Colosseum, where we met with Simone our guide.
Simone came highly recommended and didn’t disappoint. For the next 3 days he gave us most insightful, and interesting historical tours we’ve ever had.
Per Simone’s suggestion we bought Colosseum tickets online, and didn’t have to wait. The tour started with Simone talking about the construction, types of stones and techniques that made up Colosseum.
As we made our way up Simone talked about gladiators, their training, lives and strategy they used to survive and thrive on the arena. Simone had encyclopedic knowledge of history, archeology, art, culture and languages and weaved together an amazing narrative.
With Simone’s help we were transported almost two thousand years back and the space came alive with vivid details.
We walked around the Colosseum, and learned about sitting arrangements, daily schedules, the economics of fighting, and even how romans made deals in the public bathrooms.
After Colosseum we headed across the street to ancient forum. Again history unfolded in great details because of Simone’s masterful story teller.
We talked about the origins of Christmas, and multiple meanings of the word messiah — both the god’s messenger and a king. We talked about Christianity and Constantine’s Arc, and how Nero killed himself and Trajan rushed back to claim the emperorship. We talked about Octavian conquering Jerusalem, and the original menorah imprinted on his arc. We talked about skillful manipulation, lies and propaganda that Roman senators, and emperors were so good at.
After the tour ended we visited Trajan’s market and column and headed to Trieste on via Urbana for lunch. Trieste is a relatively new place on a trendy via Urbana. It serves small round pizzas that are incredibly delicious. The owner was super nice, and super personable. He told us, that like true artist, he would never compromise and make pizza with ingredients he didn’t believe in. He said putting pepperoni on a pizza doesn’t make any sense. We agreed.
We sampled simple yet very delicious pizzas with mushrooms, artichokes, vegan without sauce and margarita. We also got a baked eggplant and Parmesan dish hat was very tasty. We finished lunch with Tiramisu, which was, without a doubt, the best one we’ve ever had.
After lunch we decided to go on a self guided tour of fountains of Rome. I saw the tour described on one of the websites and wrote it down. We started with Tritone fountain on Piazza Barberini. It’s a relatively small, but pretty fountain designed by Bernini.
Next we headed to Spanish steps, which were as busy as we found them yesterday, but less pretty because it was still daylight. At the foot of Spanish Steps we looked at another Bernini’s fountain called Ugly boat. We didn’t find it ugly, but we didn’t find it all that interesting either.
Next, according to the tour route, we were suppose to go to Trevi fountain, but since we visited it yesterday, we went straight to Piazza Navona instead.
The Piazza was very pretty with all the holiday lights and stands. We started with smaller fountain. It was really beautiful, and we took a bunch of pictures. We then moved on to Bernini masterpiece the Fountain of Four Rivers. We love the fountain, but even after reading about it and symbology it’s hard to tell which river is which.
We headed to Cul de Sac for dinner, a cozy place that came highly recommended by Joanne. The place didn’t disappoint. We shared a cheese platter, which was delicious. We enjoyed bean soup, spicy chicory. cheese ravioli, seafood black rice risotto and linguine with marinara sauce.
Morning: Skull and Bones Museum, Via Veneto 27
Lunch: Pasta Imperiale, Via dei Coronari 160
Afternoon: Vatican Museums and St Peter
Dinner: Sofia, Via di Capo le Case 51
We started day two with a breakfast at a place on via Urbana that wasn’t really great so I won’t mention it.
Our first stop was the Skull and Bones Museum — a strange place off Piazza Barberini. The entrance cost €8 for adults. We were very intrigued because the museum contained a crypt with art works made out of 4,000 skulls, and bones.
The place was literally amazing and unlike anything else we’ve ever seen. The photos weren’t allowed but I managed to take one anyway and after the guard made me delete it. We used the recover feature to restore it.
The crypt had 7 chapels each with a different arrangement and theme. Each featured different types of bones, and focused on different message about spirituality and death. It was creepy, beautiful and unlike anything else we’ve ever seen.
We bought a couple of magnets and bookmarks and headed to Campo Di Fiori. On the way over we stopped by Trevi fountain, which is always great to look at. Then we stumbled on St Ignazio Basilica and decided to explore it instead of going to Campo Di Fiori.
The basilica is quite large and beautiful. Tall ceiling has frescos in the style of Sistine Chapel with a very well done perspective. We explored chapels, tombs and oculus — all around very cool.
For lunch we headed to Pasta Imperiale on the gorgeous via dei Coronari.
Despite the fancy name this place proved to be a tiny hole in the wall, literally, we barely fit in. The pasta was absolutely delicious and super cheap only €5 each.
You could mix and match pasta and sauce. Gnocchi with pesto was the best. It simply melted in your mouth. Ravioli with spinach and ricotta were on point. We also had spaghetti and tagliatelle with marinara sauce. Pasta were just right and sauce was super fresh with chunks of real tomatoes. Portions weren’t big but the pasta was very filling.
Right after we headed over to Gelateria Del Teatro which was literally 20 steps away. We watched professional cannoli making through the window. Then we walked inside. Everything from gelato to cannoli was perfect.
No wonder this place was rated among top gelato places in Rome — delicious. We enjoyed a bunch of different flavors of gelato and cannoli — everything was absolutely great.
After lunch we headed to Vatican for our tour. A twenty minute walk ended with breathtaking views of casa St. Angelo and St. Peter. Kids were very impressed with the St Peter square, and we took a bunch of pictures.
Simone, our guide, was waiting for us by the entrance. Again, because he told us to buy Vatican museum tickets online we didn’t have to wait and went straight into the museum.
Simone gave us another unforgettable tour full of amazing historical details and insights. We started with Ancient Rome artifacts, and worked our way through tapestry and maps rooms to Sistine Chapel.
We continued the tour inside St Peter Cathedral and enjoyed Le Pieta and several sculptures by Bernini. Again our guide made the tour incredibly informative and engaging.
After the Vatican we took 45 min walk back to get to our dinner place, a restaurant called Sofia.
Great food, a little pricier than other places, but really good food. The place is small and very cozy. We shared mushroom and blue cheese pie, and for appetizer. For the main course we had risotto, bean soup, and cod with side of potatoes — all great. For desert we had chocolate cake and red courant cheesecake, which was amazing.
Morning: Tivoli
Afternoon: St Maria Maggiore
Dinner: La Taverna Dei Fori Imperiali, Via della Madonna dei Monti, 9
Day 4 was our first trip, a guided tour to Tivoli. We met with Simone and the driver at 8:30 near our house. Driver cost us €275 for entire tour. It made sense since there were 7 of us.
On the way over we talked about politics, economics, travel, history of Italy and many other things. Simone has truly encyclopedic knowledge, has taught in University of Rome, and has traveled the world. Every single conversation with him was awesome and exciting.
Tivoli is just a short 30 min ride from Rome. We first went to visit Hadrian’s villa. When Hadrian became an emperor he didn’t get along with the Senate, so he decided to not live on Palatine hill like other emperors, but rather decided to build a villa in Tivoli. To make sure the senators don’t disturb him and don’t try to kill him, Hadrian kept a legion of soldiers near by.
The ruins are rather well preserved and we enjoyed the tour very much. Hadrian designed the villa in a thoughtful and meticulous style. Imagine a modern house but each room amplified to be the size of a half or full football field — a study, gym, the dinning room, bathroom, etc. a study was a sacred place where emperor was meditating for days and couldn’t be disturbed.
Bath was used by the emperor and his servants, soldiers and even slaves. Dinning room was designed to be 3 different dining from rooms so that depending on the time of the day, sun angle and season you can pick the best combination — for example, cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.
Hadrian also was incredibly well traveled and recreated several of his favorite places inside the palace. For example he designed Egyptian style pool with statues running around, and actual crocodiles inside. He surrounded the pool with the dinning area, so his guests could eat in a reclined position and enjoy the view.
In the afternoon we went up to see villa d’Este, which was created by Cardinal Ippolito d’Este. Again, Simone took us on an amazing tour of history and gave us an awesome perspective on the villa. It turns out that the cardinal came from influential and powerful family that had close ties to France.
He was very close to becoming a pope, but German king vetoed his papacy. After a bitter loss the cardinal embarked on the quest to prove that he is a better men by spending over $1MM Scusi (likely close to $100mm in today’s money) over 20 years to build the villa.
It was worth it. The design of the villa is incredible. First, the villa itself featured beautiful rooms with frescos by famous painters. But the best part of the villa are the gardens with 50 fountains and 60 waterfalls, all ingeniously laid out and flawlessly executed.
We got back to Rome in early afternoon, and were in the mood for sweets. We used Foursquare to find that a highly rated Gelateria Fatamorgana was right next to our apartment. We headed there, and discovered tiny place with high quality gelato and no place to seat. Gelato was great, but we also needed coffee.
Next, we stumbled on the whole in the wall butcher shop with most amazing Italian pastry Sfogliatella. The owner of the shop only spoke numbers in English, but I discerned that he said eat it while it is hot. We ate all 3 and then went back got two more. It was just delicious.
After coffee we went up to see St Maria Maggiore, one of the biggest. Churches in Rome. We bought a quick tour to get up on the balcony to enjoy the view, and check out massive mosaic, papal rooms and a Bernini staircase.
We had dinner reservations at La Taverna Dei Fori Imperiali. But unfortunately it was closed and we went across the street to The problem is it was closed so we moved across the street to Angelino “ai fori”. The place was good, but not amazing.
8:00AM Train Rome => Florence
Snack: Antico Vinaio, via dei Neri 65
Morning: Academia, Ufizzi
Lunch: Eataly, Via dei Martelli 22
Afternoon: Duomo, Ponte Vecchio
Dinner: Mercado Centrale
9PM: Train to Rome
This morning we got up and headed to Termini to take 1.5h train to Florence. We bought tickets in advance using Italia rail web site. Ticket prices seem to vary and there are different web sites that sell them. Ours ended up being about €60 per person for the round trip.
Navigating train station is really easy, just look up your train number on a big screen to see the platform. The ride to Florence is quick and pleasant.
Our first stop in Florence was a famous sandwich shop Antico Vinaio. The sandwiches were super delicious — highly recommended.
Next we headed to Uffizi gallery. We bought Uffizi tickets online, but still had to stand in line to get the tickets, and then another line to get into the museum. The highlights are of course two paintings by Botticelli — Birth of Venus and Primavera. We also enjoyed Caravaggio and spent some time looking at pre-renaissance Italian painters.
After two hours kids were tired, and we went to lunch at La Fettuna, instead of walking to Eataly. This is a family style place where we had grilled chicken, gnocchi with tomato pasta, cheese, marinated artichokes, and thick soup made of vegetables and bread. Food was good, not amazing, but waiters were super friendly.
After lunch we went to walk through Ponte Vecchio which was super crowded, but really festive. After that we headed towards another bridge to have gelato at Santa Trinita. It was fabulous, I particularly enjoyed Strawberry sorbet.
Right next to the gelato place here was a shop with art supplies and kids wanted to check it out. They spent a bunch of time looking at different pencils, and markers and ended up buying a few.
We crossed the bridge, and headed back towards Duomo. The streets lid up with amazing lights and great atmosphere. When we got to Duomo the main church was closed, but we got into the baptistery and had a chance to admire it’s fantastic mosaic.
After baptistery kids and I headed to Campanile, and set to climb 414 steps up to the top. After 20 min wait we got in and started the climb. There was two way traffic and really hard to pass people. We kept going up and up and up and finally reached the very top.
It was very windy but the views were worth it. We took a few pictures and then started to go down. It was a little more awkward, but didn’t take long.
After the Campanile we walked around main square with a beautiful tree and then headed to the market.
The market in Florence is two floors and the second floor is entirely occupied by bistros, pizza, pasta and sandwich places. It’s one of the best markets in Europe, if not the best one, that we’ve been too.
The atmosphere was awesome. The food was just gorgeous and you didn’t know what to get. We finally settled on a pizza place, and also had a spinach rice ball, vegan soup and a bunch of cannoli.
After the market we took a short, 7 minute walk to the train and headed back to Rome. We were a bit bummed out that we didn’t get to Academia and Duomo, but overall we spent a great day in Florence.
Morning: Pantheon
Lunch: Obica: Via dei Prefetti, 26a angolo Piazza Firenze
Afternoon: Borghese Gallery
NYE: Circus Maximus
We decided to sleep in and got up around 9:30AM. After breakfast we took a walk to Pantheon. The entrance is free, and Pantheon is awesome. We read up on the history, and walked around.
Next we did a bit of souvenir hunting, and then went to Campo Di Fiori. We ran into a fresh fruit stand and couldn’t resist. The fruits were really delicious.
After the market we headed to our lunch place — Obica — a mozzarella bar. We ordered mozzarella, burrata, ricotta samplers and roasted eggplant and focaccia, several salads, soups and pastas. Everything was incredibly delicious, particularly cheeses and eggplant. This easily made our top 3 places of the trip.
After lunch we took 30 minute walk to up the hill to visit Villa Borgehese. This is one of the top museums in Rome, and we didn’t want to miss it. We bought tickets online ahead of time. You have to arrive at specific time and can only be in the museum for 2 hours.
The highlights of the museum were statues by Bernini including Apollo and Daphne, which is just breathtaking. Museum also features paintings by Caravaggio and Titan. Overall, it is a small museum, but it really packs the punch.
We went back towards our apartment, and decided to have dinner back at Trieste. As the first time pizzas were delicious. We also ordered soup of the day which was awesome. And, of course, we had to get the tiramisu again too.
After dinner we went back to apartment to rest before NYE.
At about 10pm we got back to the streets and headed to Colosseum and Circus Maximus to enjoy the New Year eve show. The streets were fairly crowded. We got to Circus Maximus about 11 pm. It was absolutely packed. It was super loud, and nearly impossible to breath because of smoke.
The show started with acrobats with drums flying over crowds. It was kind of cool and bizarre at the same time.
The crowds kept getting bigger, and it felt like at least several hundred thousand people there.
We waited until the countdown and joined the roar. 5 minutes after New Year we headed out, and walked home. Honestly the show was a little underwhelming but we had a good time anyway, and wer happy to be in Rome for 2017.
Day 7: Rome, New Years Day
We woke up late around 10:30am. Our plan was to go to Jewish Ghetto and Trastevere.
We had breakfast at Annalemma because our usual breakfast place was closed. The service was slow but yogurts with blueberries and omelette a where good. I got food next door at Ce Stamo a Pensa, which is a tiny street food place. Vegetable calzone and fried donut were absolutely delicious.
After breakfast we headed to Bocca dela Verita — a giant ancient face carved into a stone located near entrance to Santa Maria Cosmedin. We spent about 30 mins in line, waiting to stick our hands inside the mouth. The legend has it that of you tell a lie while holding your hand in the mouth, it will be bitten off.
With all our fingers and other body parts in tact we headed off towards Great Synagogue. We bought tickets to Jewish Museum, which also included a tour of synagogue. The museum was compact, but informative. The tour was kind of meh, but the synagogue was impressive.
After the museum we headed to via Portico d’Ottavia to sample local delicacies. The Bosscione bakery was closed, but we got a bunch of very tasty sweets at Cremeria Romana.
We then got fried artichokes at Yesh Sheni, and while looking for a place to eat them stumbled upon Bocca Di Dama. We bought coffee, hot chocolate, a couple of small hazelnut pastries, and one gelato. The gelato was chocolate and orange and the second scope was berries. Super delicious.
We made a two minute walk to see Fontane delle Tartarughe, a small but pretty fountain where dolphins got replaced by turtles. Right next to the fountain there was a cute pepper store.
After we headed to Trastevere, and crossed via Tiber Island — a tiny island with pretty views. We wanted to have dinner at Antico Carolone and stopped by to make a reservation. We got lucky, and got a table for 6:30 pm.
In Trastevere we first headed to St Cecile, a small church tucked in one of the smaller squares. The church had pretty courtyard.
We then went towards Santa Maria in Trastevere — the biggest church of the neighborhood. On the way we walked through more pretty streets. On the plaza before the church a street performer impressed us with her fire skills.
At 7:30 we got back to the restaurant and were immediately seated. The waiters were super warm and attentive. We ordered grilled vegetable antipasto and fried artichokes for appetizer and 3 kinds of pastas. Everything was very homey and very delicious.
In general we were surprised by home many food places where open on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day — a lot more than we would expect. Being in Rome for the holidays is no problem at all food wise, and attractions were open as well. The weather was really great 50 and sometimes close to 60. In the evenings it got, but never really cold.
Next day was our last day and we just did wanted to do the tour of our favorites — La Licata. Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pasta Imperiale, Gelateria Del Teatro, and, of course, Trieste pizza. We did manage to swing by St Peter in Vincoli which has spectacular statue of Moses by Michelangelo.
We had an amazing time in Rome in December and this was an unforgettable trip. Kids are already asking to go back ;)

This morning, I stopped by a coffee bar near my house. I’ve become friends with the barista, Stefano. As Stefano prepared my macchiato lungo, he said he had some sad news. His father, who had been ill for some time, had died. The funeral was canceled because of the restrictions imposed on the region.
Stefano placed my coffee on the counter. Normally, in an Italian coffee shop, you stand at the bar and drink the tiny cup of espresso. I took a few sips as we continued talking. A guy with his phone to his ear, apparently a co-worker, stepped over and rapped sharply on the bar. I’d violated a rule. All customers, per the decree, are to sit at tables. This is part of the mandate that people are to maintain a one-meter distance from each other. Stefano said that if a policeman drove by and saw me drinking coffee at the counter, he could be fined several thousand euros. He also reported that city officials had been driving past with bullhorns, urging everybody to stay inside.
Yesterday, at the local supermarket, a man in a uniform…directed everyone to get a large…

When you live abroad Italy is that country that everyone knows. Everyone loves. Everyone has a story about. A son that got married there. A friend that had an amazing time in a city you never heard of.
Italy is the country that lights up people’s face. When they hear you are Italian, a smile appears on their face: “Ah, I-ta-li-anooo”, it’s the most common reaction. And then they start with their stories. Of all shape and type, but with always one thing in common: love. It seems like everyone abroad loves Italy. They love our food, our people, our sea, our mountains, our countryside, our cities, our clothes, our style, our hospitality, our culture, our football teams, our cars and motors, our actors and singers. And the list could go on and on.
In more than 3 years leaving abroad I cannot count how much love, stories and nice words I have heard about our country. I heard people saying: “Believe me, I’ve travelled most of the World by now: Italy is Italy, there’s nothing as unique and beautiful.”
Love doesn’t have an explanation, it’s love that explains things
Let’s start from here. From our culture, from our beauty and our history.
We are incredibly lucky, we just don’t see it — we are too close.

Italy, a land of stunning landscapes, rich history, and unparalleled culture, has captivated the hearts of travelers and scholars for centuries. From its ancient ruins to world-renowned cuisine, Italy boasts an array of symbols and traditions that have left an indelible mark on the world. In this article, we will explore the top three things for which Italy is most renowned: its art and architecture, its cuisine, and its fashion.
Italy has been at the forefront of artistic innovation for centuries, playing a pivotal role in the development of Western art. The country is home to some of the most significant and influential artists in history, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Caravaggio. Their masterpieces, which adorn galleries, churches, and public spaces across Italy, continue to inspire generations.
When it comes to architecture, Italy has some of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. The Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Colosseum in Rome, and St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City are just a few examples. Each of these structures tells a story, not only of architectural prowess but also of the cultural and historical significance of their times.
The Renaissance, which began in Italy during the 14th century, marked a significant turning point in the realm of art and architecture. This period saw the rebirth of classical ideals, leading to the creation of breathtaking works that continue to draw art lovers from all corners of the globe. Florence, often regarded as the cradle of the Renaissance, is particularly famous for its contributions to art and culture, with its Uffizi Gallery housing masterpieces that tell the story of human expression.
Italian cuisine is world-famous, celebrated for its fresh ingredients, bold flavors, and regional diversity. The country’s culinary history tells a story of simplicity and tradition. Every dish carries a deep connection to the land and the people, making Italian food as much about love and family as it is about sustenance.
Some of the hallmark dishes of Italian cuisine include pasta, pizza, and risotto. Each region has its own variations and specialties. For instance, in Naples, the classic Margherita pizza showcases a simple yet delightful combination of tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. In contrast, pasta dishes like Tagliatelle al Ragù resonate deeply within households and are often made from scratch.
One of the key aspects of Italian cooking is the emphasis on fresh, high-quality ingredients. The Mediterranean climate allows for the cultivation of exceptional produce, such as ripe tomatoes, fragrant basil, and rich olive oil. Italian cuisine encourages the use of seasonal ingredients, resulting in dishes that not only taste exceptional but also reflect the cycle of nature.
Italy is often regarded as the fashion capital of the world, with cities like Milan and Florence leading the charge in haute couture and luxury design. Italian fashion has a distinctive style that embraces sophistication, innovation, and craftsmanship. Renowned designers like Gucci, Prada, and Versace have made their mark not only on the runways of Milan but also in the hearts of fashion enthusiasts globally.
Milan Fashion Week is one of the most prestigious events in the fashion calendar, where designers unveil their latest collections to the world. This event showcases a mix of established fashion houses and emerging designers, illustrating the dynamic nature of Italian fashion. The impact of Italian style permeates beyond clothing; it influences accessories, jewelry, and even the world of home design.
What sets Italian fashion apart is its commitment to craftsmanship and attention to detail. Many Italian brands uphold a tradition of artisanal techniques, ensuring that each piece embodies quality and elegance. The “Made in Italy” label is synonymous with luxury and is a mark of pride for designers and craftsmen alike.
Italy is rich in artistic heritage across various regions. Key areas include:
Italian cuisine varies significantly by region due to geographical factors, climate, and local produce. For instance, Northern Italy features creamy risottos, while Southern Italy is known for its robust tomato-based dishes. Each region’s traditions and ingredients uniquely shape its culinary offerings.
Italian fashion is influenced by historical and cultural factors, including art, architecture, and societal changes. The elegance of Renaissance art often influences contemporary designs, while modern-day Milan serves as a hub for global fashion trends, blending tradition with innovation.
To truly immerse yourself in Italian culture, consider:
The “Made in Italy” label signifies quality, luxury, and craftsmanship. It represents products made in Italy, often using traditional methods and high-grade materials, thereby reflecting Italy’s dedication to excellence in design and production.
Italy, with its enchanting art, delectable cuisine, and impeccable fashion sense, stands as a beacon of culture and heritage for the world. Each of these three aspects intertwines with the identity of the Italian people and showcases their contributions to art, food, and style. Whether you’re an avid art enthusiast, a food lover, or a fashion aficionado, Italy offers a rich tapestry of experiences that celebrate what it means to be Italian.

Buying an apartment in Italy — or how to survive a sanatoria,https://medium.com/@kalle.wuoti/buying-an-apartment-in-italy-or-how-to-survive-a-sanatoria-12c43bee884f,"Sign up

I am a Finnish software developer who recently moved to Italy. This is the third episode in a series of posts where I write about my experiences in living in my new home country.
The observations are written by someone who has lived most of his life in the Northern Europe: first around 30 years in Finland and then some years in the Netherlands.
This post is not strictly part of the same canon as the previous ones as I wasn’t yet living in Italy at the time the events took place. But the story is still worth telling because it revolves around the same topic as the previous episode: bureaucracy, oh yes!
Around August 2021 me and my girlfriend were looking for an apartment to buy in Sardinia. We went to see a couple of places and found an interesting one. In October, after a careful calculation of our financial status, we decided to make an offer for the apartment. To our surprise the offer was accepted! I started dreaming about sitting on my own patio staring into the sunset while enjoying an ice-cold Ichnusa non filtrata.
I had heard horror stories on how the bureaucracy in Italy can be extremely slow. My pessimistic expectation was that drinking Ichnusa on the patio would have to wait around early spring 2022. Magari!
I wanted to make sure that I have everything ready when the time comes to sign the papers and make the notary act. I applied for a codice fiscale in the Embassy of Italy in the Hague. I contacted my bank in Finland to apply for a mortgage, and I even had the purchase proposal translated into English for them. I made all the necessary arrangements to have all my finances available with a few clicks of a button. My bank told me that after signing the documents for the mortgage, it could take even up to a week for the funds to be available. I assured them that one week is nothing when dealing with Italian bureaucracy.
At the same time, my girlfriend was also applying for a mortgage in an Italian bank. One of the requirements for the mortgage was that there should be a technical inspection done on the apartment. Sounds reasonable. The real estate agent told us that since the building is relatively new, from the early 2000s, and the apartment is quite small, the technical inspection is just a formality, and that there shouldn’t be any issues with it.
The inspection was done around December, and we were anxiously waiting for the statement to be released. Around middle of February we received a message from the agent that all lights are green, and that everything is ready for signing the purchase agreement. I withdrew the mortgage and liquidated my other assets. I was proud of myself for being fully prepared and having everything ready. Finnish efficiency at its best — I’m not going to be the bottleneck. We agreed that we would sign the purchase agreement March 1st. I could almost taste the Ichnusa.
Things started getting delayed by a few weeks but I wasn’t worried. I guess minor delays were expected and nothing out of the ordinary. But then we heard that there is an issue that was noticed in the technical inspection. This is the first time I heard the horrifying word: sanatoria. Sanatoria in itself is not a bad thing, it’s actually good. But the problem is when the sanatoria has not been done, in other words the sanatoria is unresolved. In the context of real estate, this means that someone has improvised and built something funky without proper permissions and violated the building regulations. In Finland this means building an illegal sauna too close to the shore. Legally, you cannot sell an apartment that has an unresolved sanatoria. (Though, this being Italy, of course there’s always a way.)
The technical inspection declared that there was a mismatch between the official documents and the reality. According to the documents there should be a small balcony in the bedroom. In fact, there was no balcony but there is a window. This was a surprise both to us and the owner of the apartment. But doesn’t sound like too big of a problem, right? One might think that it would be a bigger issue if there was a balcony that shouldn’t be there. And yes, that’s true. It didn’t seem like a big problem. But while the balcony didn’t exist, whoever genius who built the apartment had decided to make the bedroom slightly larger than it was supposed to be. And that’s not good.
What is the solution? You need to find a way to make the documents and the reality aligned. So you have to either grab a hammer and start building a balcony, or you need to amend the documents. I don’t know how to build a balcony and I would expect that adjusting the paperwork is easier so that’s what we decided to do. Practically, this means that you need to have a good connection with the municipality officials and you need to hire a local geometra to come make measurements, and draw new blueprints, etc. Obviously, depending on the size of the sanatoria, all of this costs money, but time is the bigger problem. The owner would pay for the sanatoria but it can take a long time to get it resolved, even years.
Apparently, in Sardinia this is a common problem. There are many houses that have an unresolved sanatoria which effectively means that you cannot sell or buy them. Our agent came up with a marvellous (though not a unique) idea: Rather than signing the purchase agreement at this moment, we could make a private agreement with the owner stating that we pay some lump of money right now in advance, then we would wait for the sanatoria to be resolved, I could already go drink Ichnusa on the patio, and after that we would finalise the deal and sign the purchase agreement. Sounds amazing, right? Wrong. If you’ve read my previous posts, you already know that I’m not a big fan of this kind of unorthodox arrangements. We kindly rejected the idea.
The agent assured us that the sanatoria should be definitely resolved by the end of May. Time passed, our offer expired, we renewed the offer, winter turned to spring, Ichnusa got warm, and spring turned to summer. The offer expired again in June and we renewed it for one final time. It expired again in July and we decided not to renew it anymore. We hadn’t heard anything from the agent for a long time. I still had all the earmarked money lying in my bank account. I was sad and disappointed.
In July I went for a trip to Scotland with my friends. We booked a rental car and drove around while sipping whisky: Edinburgh, Inverness, Isle of Skye, Fort William, Oban, Glasgow, and back to Edinburgh. I highly recommend Scotland as a travel destination. I learned that Speyside whisky is not my favourite but I do like Highland whisky. And it was confirmed that I especially enjoy the smoky ones from Islay. Also, after having tasted a whisky it’s nice to compare your experience with maestro Lüning, Horst Lüning, and see what is his interpretation of it. I challenge you to come up with as many adjectives to describe the whisky as Horst does.
Anyway, by the end of our heavily peated trip in Scotland I received a message from my girlfriend that suddenly things are moving fast with the apartment. By some miracle the sanatoria had been resolved and that, if we are still interested, the owner is willing to sell the apartment for the same price as we initially offered. We had to act fast, because the mortgage proposal provided by the Italian bank for my girlfriend was expiring in September, and at this moment we were almost in August. August in Italy is the peak holiday season so finding a notary to notarise the purchase agreement could be extremely difficult, but luckily the agent already had one available.
Finally, grazie a Dio, in the beginning of August we bought the apartment. It only took around 10 months after we made the initial offer. The purchase happened at the same time as we were about to move from the Netherlands to Italy, which felt a bit overwhelming in the beginning. However, the combination of living in the mainland Italy, in Frascati, and having a beach house in Sardinia has turned out to be a fantastic concept. And Ichnusa does taste pretty damn good when you enjoy it on your own patio.
Random observations about the whole process:

Italy, a country renowned for its rich history, breathtaking landscapes, and delectable cuisine, carries with it several nicknames that reflect its unique identity. These monikers capture the essence of the nation and the various aspects that make it special. In this article, we will explore Italy’s most popular nicknames, their meanings, and what they signify about this beautiful country.
One of Italy’s most famous nicknames is “Bel Paese,” which translates to “Beautiful Country” in English. This nickname encapsulates Italy’s extraordinary natural beauty, encompassing everything from its picturesque countryside, rolling hills, and stunning coastal regions to its historic cities filled with architectural marvels.
The name “Bel Paese” is frequently used in art and literature to describe the aesthetic beauty of Italy. It represents Italy’s legacy of art and culture, where countless artists, musicians, and writers have drawn inspiration. From the scenic landscapes of Tuscany to the grandeur of Venice, it is no surprise that Italy is celebrated for its beauty.
Italy is often colloquially referred to as the “Boot” due to its distinctive shape resembling a high-heeled boot on the map. This playful nickname is used mainly in informal contexts and reflects the country’s geographical layout.
The “Boot” concept adds an element of charm to discussing Italy and is often used to help depict the different regions of the country. For example, the “toe” of the boot refers to Calabria, while the “heel” pertains to Apulia. This geographical representation enables both Italians and visitors to understand the country’s diverse geographical and cultural landscape better.
Another popular nickname that resonates with many people is “La Dolce Vita,” which translates to “The Sweet Life.” This phrase became particularly famous after the release of Federico Fellini’s 1960 film of the same name. The essence of “La Dolce Vita” captures the Italian spirit of enjoying life’s pleasures, from delicious food and wine to beautiful art and architecture.
Italy’s rich culinary tradition, full of regional specialties, delightful desserts, and world-famous wines, epitomizes this philosophy. Italians celebrate family gatherings, socializing over meals, and savoring life’s simple pleasures — an approach to life that many associate with the Italian way of living.
While not a nickname in the traditional sense, it is essential to note that the very name “Italia” carries immense historical significance. The term “Italia” originally referred to a specific region in Southern Italy and has roots dating back to the ancient Greeks. Over the centuries, the name expanded to encompass the entire country after the unification of Italy in the 19th century.
The name is derived from the ancient Italic tribes that settled in the region. Today, “Italia” is a source of pride for Italians and an integral part of the country’s identity. It represents the nation’s long history, rich cultural heritage, and diverse regional influences.
Italy is also often referred to as “The Land of the Popes” due to its historical and religious significance. With over 1,800 years of papal history, Rome is home to the Vatican City — the smallest independent state in the world and the spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church.
This nickname highlights Italy’s important role in the history of Christianity and its influence on global religious practices. Not only does it identify Italy with a significant aspect of its culture, but it also attracts millions of tourists annually who visit the Vatican to see treasures like St. Peter’s Basilica and the Sistine Chapel.
Italy is famously known as “The Cradle of the Renaissance,” a nickname that captures its historical importance as the birthplace of one of the most significant cultural movements in European history. The Renaissance, which occurred from the 14th to the 17th century, marked a period of rejuvenation in art, science, and thought, leading to monumental changes in society.
Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome were pivotal in showcasing revolutionary ideas and artistic achievements. Renowned artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael emerged during this time, and their works continue to be celebrated worldwide. The nickname reminds us of Italy’s enduring legacy as a cultural powerhouse.
Italy is known by several nicknames, including “Bel Paese” (Beautiful Country), “The Boot,” “La Dolce Vita” (The Sweet Life), “The Land of the Popes,” and “The Cradle of the Renaissance.”
Italy is colloquially referred to as the “Boot” because of its distinctive geographical shape that resembles a high-heeled boot on the world map. This nickname is useful for identifying different regions of the country, like referring to the “toe” or “heel.”
“La Dolce Vita” translates to “The Sweet Life,” reflecting the Italian ethos of savoring life’s pleasures, including food, art, and company. It symbolizes the relaxed and joyful approach to life that many associate with Italian culture.
Italy earned this nickname due to its significant role in the Renaissance, a period of cultural rebirth that began in the 14th century. Notable cities like Florence and artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo emerged during this transformative era, leading to lasting contributions in art, philosophy, and science.
The name “Italia” has historical roots, originating from ancient Italic tribes. It has since become a source of national pride and represents the country’s cultural heritage and diversity stemming from thousands of years of history.
Italy’s nicknames encapsulate the nation’s beauty, culture, and historical significance. From “Bel Paese” to “La Dolce Vita,” these monikers highlight the unique aspects of Italian life and the enduring impact that Italy has had on art, cuisine, and religion across the world. The richness of Italy’s nicknames is a testament to its profound influence over the centuries, drawing visitors from all around the globe to experience the magic of this remarkable country.

The alarm clock goes off at 7:00am. I immediately do my morning stretches before going for my habitual morning run, a few kilometers traversing the narrow, winding streets of Cinque Vie and around the Castello Sforzesco. After, either a bowl of whole-grain cereal mixed with bananas and strawberries and Turkish coffee. If I’m feeling extra Italian, a brioches al pistacchio topped off with a warm cup of cappuccino at the corner café. Then I’m off to work at my office located in the historic 14th century Palazzo Borromeo. Lunches would consist of either a plate of pasta or a protein-based dish, to be had on the fashionable piazza just in front of my office with a view of a 16th century church. In the evening, a drink or two at my favorite lounge at the Darsena neighborhood. Had it been Fashion Week or Design Week, a quick pit-stop at an after party or at a gallery opening before heading home to get a peaceful night’s rest.
This was how some of my days looked like in Milan, the city I called home for nearly a decade. I had moved to this bustling metropolis at the tender age of seventeen to study at university. With dreams as vast as the endless cityscape before me, I embarked on a voyage of self-discovery, leaving behind the familiar comforts of my hometown of Jakarta.
The streets of Milan hummed with the promise of adventure, each corner whispering secrets waiting to be uncovered. Amidst the towering skyscrapers and labyrinthine cobblestone alleyways, I found myself at the cusp of adulthood, navigating the intricate tapestry of urban life with a blend of trepidation and exhilaration. With every step, I wove my own narrative into the fabric of the city, carving out a place for myself amidst the chaos and possibility. And so, the saga of my odyssey began, a tale of resilience, growth, and the boundless potential of a longing to succeed.
This journey had not been without its lows. Finding myself in the midst of an international crowd had made it difficult to learn the local language, especially during my initial years in Milan. It was only when I started to join the workforce that the melody of the language began to spark a note within me. What had initially been thinking twice and endlessly practicing under my breath before going into a café to order an espresso eventually became second nature. Over the years, I had become a fixture at these cafés; the staff need not ask what I would like to order anymore, they simply bring me il solito, the usual. I am, after all, a creature of habit.
I owe much of my relative prowess in the language to my friends and colleagues, who patiently endured my stumbling attempts at conjugations. Their encouragement, coupled with countless laughs at my linguistic missteps, transformed my rudimentary grasp of Italian into something more coherent. Granted, they didn’t teach me to speak Italian; they taught me to speak Milanese, which is what some Italians regard as a refined blend of English and Italian generally spoken by overachieving business people and stylish fashion enthusiasts in the nation’s financial capital.
Covered in an abundance of arts and culture, my life in Milan had been rather colorful. I had the remarkable opportunity to come across people from diverse backgrounds, eat marvelous food, and travel relentlessly. However, it had not always been easy. When the pandemic hit at the onset of this decade, like many other young people starting off in their careers, I had struggled to cope with the stringent restrictions. I was fortunate enough to be living with two extraordinary people who respectively hailed from Spain and Sicily, who undoubtedly made my time in quarantine worthwhile. We would sit for hours over home-made Sicilian cuisine sharing stories about our lives prior to coming to Milan. As the sun-kissed Mediterranean flavors danced in our palates, we all felt extremely connected through the commonalities we had discovered in the stories we shared. Naturally, we all kept in touch after we went our separate ways, the Spaniard to Emilia Romagna and the Sicilian to her native island. She would sometimes send me the quintessential pacco da giù, a package usually sent by madres and nonnas of the South to their children and grandchildren in the North. She would fill these pacchi with paste di mandorla, my favorite Sicilian dessert after cannoli.
Among the bustling piazzas of the city, there lay a treasure trove of museums, each a sanctuary for treasured paintings and sculptures. These cultural havens became my beloved retreats, and further fueled my interest for the arts. I often find myself gazing at Francesco Hayez’s Il bacio, the masterpiece on display towards the end of the Pinacoteca di Brera, for prolonged periods of time. Michelangelo’s statue of David commands attention from its prominent position at the heart of the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence, about a two-hour train ride from Milan. I stood transfixed, drawn into the intricate details of this renowned sculpture. Florence offered more than its artistic treasures; as I wondered through its enchanting streets, I was greeted by breathtaking views of the Arno river and the red-tiled rooftops that stretched out before me. I indulged in copious amounts of Tuscan bread, each bite a revelation. Renowned for its lack of salt, it seemed to sing with the flavors of the region, a perfect complement to the rich olive oil and robust wines.
Having lived in one of the most prominent fashion capitals of the world, it would come to no surprise that I had made a great deal of friends that are somehow intertwined with the realm of haute couture. My interactions with them made me somewhat of an expert on the topic. Although I do struggle differentiating between cerulean and other shades of blue, I have learnt enough to know that my favorite fashion show is Alexander McQueen’s Ready-to-Wear Spring ’98; that Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace had a heated rivalry throughout the late twentieth century; and that Tom Ford had initially worked at Gucci before starting his eponymous brand.
Although Milan was beautiful in its own right during the day, it was the nights where the lion awakens in its den. A cocktail da asporto in hand listening to L’appuntamento by the majestic Ornella Vanoni, whilst casually staring at the latest pieces of high fashion embossed in fluorescent light at Via Montenapoleone. Those were the days.
Nestled in the heart of Lombardy, Milan offered a gateway to mountains, lakes, and beaches. This geographical blessing meant that adventures were never far away. During the sun-soaked summers, my best friend and I would embark on journeys to the charming coastal towns of Liguria in his sky blue vintage sedan listening to Italian hits from the ’80s. The salty breeze mingled with the nostalgia of the music, creating a soundtrack to our youthful escapades. As the seasons shifted and snow dusted the peaks, our attention turned to the Italian Alps. Bundled up in our warmest gear, we’d venture into the snowy expanse, eager to carve fresh tracks on the slopes. The thrill of skiing down those majestic mountains was unmatched, each run a new adventure waiting to be discovered.
Milan, with its strategic location at the heart of three international airports, was more than just a city; it was a launchpad to adventures far beyond its borders. International travel became a routine part of life. Den Haag to attend my sister’s birthday dinner? Easy. Frankfurt for my best friend’s wedding? Just another weekend trip. Athens for a bachelor’s party? Been there, done that. London to visit my uncle? A frequent flyer. From the cobblestone streets of Den Haag to the vibrant markets of Athens, each destination held its own allure and charm. Yet, no matter how far I traveled, Milan remained my anchor, always welcoming me back with open arms. It wasn’t just a city; it was the starting point for countless journeys, each one leaving an indelible mark on my soul. And for that, Milan will always hold a special place in my heart.
Navigating the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy was a trial by fire, one that tested my patience and resolve in ways I never imagined. The infamous Italian red tape was a beast of its own, one that many expats struggled to tame. I was lucky enough to emerge relatively unscathed, but I witnessed the battles of others who weren’t as fortunate. I quickly learned that trying to fight the system was like banging my head against a brick wall — painful and ultimately futile. So, I did what any survivor in Italy does: I adapted. One of my greatest accomplishments was obtaining my driver’s license in Italy. Months of grappling with specific terminology and enduring compulsory driving lessons, all conducted in Italian, were no small feat. If there is one way to master the art of driving, it is by maneuvering through the narrow streets of Milan while receiving colorful scolding in Italian from your instructor as you deftly dodge a Fiat 500 driven by a formidable nonna.
As my time in Milan drew to a close, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness at the thought of leaving behind spontaneous adventures. No more day trips to the serene beauty of Lago di Como or the romantic allure of Verona. But as I packed my bags, I knew that the memories of those carefree days exploring the wonders of Il Bel Paese would stay with me forever.
Italy became not just a destination but a journey of self-discovery, marking the beginning of my solo adventures in a foreign land. It was my first taste of independence, a chapter in my life where I learned to stand on my own two feet. I couldn’t claim to have made it solely on my own. Behind every step I took were the unwavering support and love of my family, friends, and colleagues. Their encouragement and guidance were the pillars that held me up during moments of doubt and uncertainty. Yet, Italy represented more than just a physical location. It was a decade-long odyssey, a tapestry woven with the threads of newfound friendships and unforgettable experiences.
Living away from my family and the friends I grew up with was a challenge, but it was also an opportunity to create a life enriched by the presence of beautiful souls who became like a second family to me. They shared in my triumphs and failures, my joys and sorrows, shaping the person I was becoming. As I reflect on my time in Italy, I realize that it wasn’t just about navigating a new country; it was about navigating the depths of my own soul. And in doing so, I discovered a strength and resilience I never knew I possessed. This country had taught me a great deal of things. But it is now time to say good-bye.
Arrivederci, Italia. Until we meet again.

There is none.
Ok that’s a lie — there’s some. But honestly, coming from a US upbringing it really means none. The study of “personal space” is called Proxemics, ever since 1963 when the cultural anthropologist Edward T. Hall, decided to name it extremely appropriately. Because of his wonderful work, more people have noticed this variation of how close people like to be to other people and studied it. So now we know that in North America, the average “appropriate” distance to be away from another person is literally longer than arms-length away at four feet. Italians, the culture that likes to smoosh their faces together multiple times while greeting, are absolutely fine with two to three feet of distance. I will attest to the fact that city Italians have an even smaller circle that hardly extends past their actual being. If I go into the center, I will absolutely touch other people. This is a given now, and I have accepted it for the most part. Today at the playground in the park, however, I couldn’t get over how these kids throw themselves around and over each other without a care.
The study continued to agree that “In Italy, it’s also common for people to establish extended physical contact when having an exchange. For instance, a person may reach for a friend’s forearm as a way to communicate openness and honesty or walk arm in arm with a coworker (of any gender) as they discuss something confidential.” Even when I was younger, I never minded a pat on the arm and thought it nice, so the casual physical interactions that happen here are endearing, and usually come from the older crowd. Older Italians are absolute suckers for babies and puppies and neither is safe from roaming cuddles and kisses. Maybe that’s why the kids Proxemics numbers are subzero numbers here. I’m pondering all this today as I watch three boys crawl over each other up the slide and then past Giulio as he was trying to go down it. It’s madness.
I grew up as one of maybe ten or so kids in our neighborhood that was surrounded by corn fields and woods. We didn’t have a swing set, but we had acres of land to ourselves. Of course, this mirrors throughout society and culture. In the US,I grew up with houses having backyards, grocery stores had parking lots as big as the piazzas here. Three grocery carts could pass in an aisle at the same time. I could do cartwheels in my bedroom. Here, if I did a cartwheel in any part of my house, I’d definitely be at the hospital. If I don’t have to wait for a traffic jam of carts to clear in the grocery store, it’s a good day. As described, the neighborhood fits about forty-eight (this is like a guess-the-jelly-beans-in-the-jar-number. I honestly have no idea. It’s a lot.) high-strung children from the ages of months to preteens in the size of a baseball diamond with four swings, and three slides. Of course youre going to get used to having less personal space — because there isn’t much to go around.
You know the little dance you do when someone else is in front of the item you need in the store? That awkward back and forth waiting for them to move? Not here. If someone wants something, they’ll get it. Maybe even move you out of the way a bit to do it. This, once accepted, is actually awesome when you can use it yourself.
Sometimes, it’s infuriating — this closeness. Sometimes, it’s pretty endearing. It certainly does bring everyone together — because we have to. Everyone is in everyone’s face always. So we learn to deal with each other — just like Giulio having no issue with being bowled over as he runs to the slide — with a special burst of confetti from the other kids on the way (it’s Carnevale here so paper confetti is a free-for-all and, again, everyone just accepts it). Of course, I still believe everyone needs a bit of personal space — and that that’s the best way to be. That’s why we get away every once in a while and have our garden out back. But as I live here longer, my bubble of personal space has gotten smaller, and I think maybe overall it’s a good thing. It really gets you in touch with the people around you. Ha!

By Natia as told to the Samuel Hall team. Photographs by Tornike Begiashvili
This story was developed as part of Samuel Hall’s work with the FAiR Consortium, focusing on research conducted in Georgia. The FAiR (Finding Agreement in Return) project aims to improve the governance of return migration in the EU, addressing the challenges of legitimacy in return migration policies and exploring viable alternatives. As a partner in the project, Samuel Hall has been working to identify key public discourses and counter-discourses surrounding immigration, emigration, and (enforced) return, and to understand how these narratives are shaped and embedded in broader public and private conversations within non-EU source and transit countries, as well as diaspora communities. This story has also been published on the FAiR website, where you can read more about the project.
Navigating the complexities of dual identities, I grew up in Italy while maintaining deep roots in Georgian soil. I was born in Georgia, but my family and I relocated to Italy when I was just 3-years-old.
The decision to move came in the aftermath of a deadly conflict. Following the Abkhazian War in 1992, my family fled to Georgia and was facing considerable hardships — shuffling between the cities of Marneuli and Tbilisi.
Life was challenging; my father, a chef, earned a meagre salary. Fortunately, his culinary skills caught the attention of an Italian restaurant in Rimini, leading to an invitation to work there. Seizing the opportunity, he relocated our family to Italy in 1996.
We were warmly welcomed. Both of my parents worked at the restaurant, while my siblings and I attended Italian schools from kindergarten through graduation. We spent 21 years in Italy without facing any discrimination, immersed in a community that embraced us.
My parents believed that raising their children abroad would offer better opportunities. However, though our lives were primarily in Italy, my parents never let us forget about Georgia and always talked about, one day, moving back. As much as possible, we tried to maintain our culture — my parents would speak to me in Georgian, and I would respond to them in Italian.
As political and security conditions in Georgia improved, we began to return for vacations, reconnecting with our homeland. It enriched my connection to Georgia. We were welcomed by the community whenever we returned because we were always in touch with them. Every time I spent the summer here, I felt so good that I never wanted to go back to Italy.
My parents had always planned on returning and had bought a house. Owning a home in Tbilisi, my father started giving Italian cooking classes for aspiring chefs. Since all restaurants were closed, my father decided to start teaching people of all ages in order to help them find jobs after the pandemic. Our classes attracted numerous students, some of whom are still working as cooks in Georgia, Italy, and the US.
As the pandemic subsided, my father decided to establish deeper roots in Georgia rather than return to Italy. He expressed that he did not want to work for anyone else anymore. Given his love for hosting people and leveraging their special pizza oven, they opened our own restaurant. The community quickly grew to love our establishment.
My father was the best chef of Italian cuisine in Georgia. In the 2000s, you would rarely see an Italian restaurant in Tbilisi. He was a pioneer spreading the love for Italian cuisine in Tbilisi.
Initially, we only expected students to come for takeout. But then, more and more customers started coming in, and expressed their desire to eat at the restaurant rather than taking it home. We had to open additional rooms to accommodate everyone. So we added another section to make the restaurant bigger. We then added another room and put tables outside. Now we can host 90 diners. My father cooks, my mother makes pizzas, and I work as a waitress. We have also hired 10 additional wait staff.
People ask why we do not open another branch. We tell them we want to keep what we have built here, the taste and the food; it’s so organic. But lately, we have started considering it.
Returning to Georgia was slightly difficult for me because the mentality and lifestyle were very different.
We have a saying in Georgia, “Where you are going, you have to put on the same hat that they are wearing” — this is what we did in Italy and what we do here in Georgia.
When I returned at 18, I had to start reading and learning the language again. You start as if you are a foreigner.
Our identities are deeply intertwined with the culinary traditions we cherish. My favourite dishes — Khinkali from Georgia and pasta from Italy — mirror my dual heritage. I could enjoy pasta every day, delighting in a variety of sauces. Typically, weekends were reserved for indulging in pasta, soups, and pizza with friends. Currently, my diet leans more towards European cuisine; I can relish Italian meals several times a day. Georgian food, with its robust flavours, is something I savour less frequently, often opting for a restaurant experience when the craving strikes.
While we still go back to Italy to visit my brother and old friends, as far as the near future is concerned, we plan to stay in Georgia and expand our business operations — but Italy is still our second home, and my parents are grateful to Italy. When my father returned from Italy, there were few Italian restaurants in Georgia. He was the first to introduce authentic Italian cuisine here, bringing everything he had learned and observed in Italy to his ‘homeland’.
To continue the legacy, I will soon be opening a pizzeria with the help and knowledge of my parents. The pizzeria will be in Tblisi’s city centre and its name will be Rimini, the place in Italy where I grew up.

Italy is culture: the US is a key partner to save art and preserve our heritage,https://medium.com/@ItalyinUS/italy-is-culture-the-us-is-a-key-partner-to-save-art-and-preserve-our-heritage-cc9323b75a10,"Sign up

“Today we celebrate the sustained excellent results of an agreement signed 15 years ago which marked the start of an intense collaboration between Italy and the US in tracking down hundreds of illicitly exported artworks,” said Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities Alberto Bonisoli in his remarks during a ceremony at the Embassy of Italy in Washington DC for the presentation of the catalog Saving Art Preserving Heritage.
“What we are seeing here is a small part of the results of that cooperation, but no less significant in that they exemplify the shared culture that unites Italy and the US,” he added.
Remarks were followed by the Repatriation Ceremony of three artifacts and by an exhibition of 20 works of art recovered in the last two years by the Carabinieri Heritage Protection Unit in collaboration with the FBI and ICE.
The importance of the event, hosted by the Italian Ambassador to the US Armando Varricchio at the presence of Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities Alberto Bonisoli and General Fabrizio Parrulli, head of the Carabinieri Heritage Protection Unit, goes beyond the catalog that was presented and what it represents — the work done by so many to preserve Italian art and antiquities for the benefit of the Republic and the global community.
Indeed, cultural heritage itself is the foundation to our global society. We see cultural heritage — art, monuments, archives — as something greater than ourselves; a reflection of our past collective identities and a legacy we wish to see survive for future generations. This survival is especially important given the vital role of heritage in crafting memories and preserving histories.
“The pillage, looting, destruction, illicit trafficking of cultural heritage, be it Roman coins, ancient illuminated pages or precious and unique works like the mosaic floor on display tonight, is a wound in the flesh of humankind,” said Ambassador Varricchio in his welcoming remarks. “Like all wounds, it will not heal, without leaving a scar. A scar in our ability to understand past civilizations and past cultures, a dent in our capacity to shed light on the incredible human journey that defines who we are today. By losing the past, we blur our present and obfuscate our future.”
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Italy, a country with a rich past, has put the preservation of cultural heritage at the top of its agenda both domestically and internationally.
The issue is crucial also for the US, which was represented by the top cultural and enforcement officials of the Administration, including U.S. Department of State Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs Marie Royce, US Department of Homeland Security Deputy Executive Associate Director Alysa Erichs, and FBI Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division Robert Johnson.
The volume presented during the event marks over 15 years of cooperation between Italy and the US to protect and preserve Italian art, antiquities, and cultural objects, made possible by a bilateral cultural property agreement that outlined steps both countries can take to combat the trafficking in Italian cultural objects. The catalog collects more than 200 recovered artifacts.
The successes we have achieved are predicated not just on the determination of the Italian Government but also on the effective cooperation we have with our partners and friends across the globe and in particular the United States.
Artistic heritage is not just a system of “artifacts” which preserves the vestiges of styles, eras, and images of bygone human history. It is also the eternally present metaphor of a past that returns in its “distance closeness” and in the enduring oxymoron of a historical becoming that, by travelling backwards, projects itself into the present and future.
For example, a painting from the 14th or 17th century opens a window on the past, but the image we see beyond the shutter is very real to our eyes. Art comes to life when we look at it and takes us back to the very same lines that the artist drew centuries before. The same is true of archaeological artifacts.
Our century finds a market for everything, and where there’s money, there’s crime. Thus the commingling in this sector of organized crime, professional thieves, adventurers, merchants, and unscrupulous gallery managers, auction houses and museums is increasingly common. Behind the criminality of this trafficking is the real loss to humanity.
The ultimate result is the irretrievable loss of historical information.
The challenge to combat art trafficking globally, and especially in Italy, is even more pressing when juxtaposed with the Republic’s peerless cultural heritage. There are more UNESCO World Heritage Sites (54 in total) in Italy than in any other nation.
Italy and the United States have met this challenge through our agreement, which uses both legal and social measures to discourage looting and increase legal access to Italian cultural heritage.
The agreement is re-evaluated every five years in order to adapt to a constantly changing world with increasingly “expert” traffickers and shifting priorities.

After the problems with my passport finally subsided (not so funny story: it was expired and I had to leave the country to renew it, but couldn’t leave the country with an expired passport), my family decided it was time to venture out further than our usual trips from northern to southern California and organize our first visit to Europe. The planning process was strenuous as each of us tried to melt our ideas of the perfect adventure together, but looking back I could not be happier with how it played out. One of the most memorable experiences, in fact, was our two-day deviation from the mainstream: Quercianella.
Rather than hitting every crowded tourist destination in Italy, we rented a car in Florence and drove down the Tuscany coast, stopping first at Sienna, and then ending at a miniature beach town by the name of Quercianella.
A town where you could count the number of restaurants on your hands, and every resident was likely on a first-name basis, this was the epitome of an escape. The air smelled of salt and the temperature was perfectly warm. Every one there seemed care-free — families walked freely on the sides of the road, shop owners sipped coffee outside, and you could see locals laying on the stretches of rock and beach basking in the sun and purely enjoying the company of friends or a good book.
After driving down the town’s narrow roads for a while, we found our “Villa Margherita” and unpacked starved, ready to uncover the local wonders. Being a Yelp-connoisseur, I offered to scour the food scene, but soon realized that Yelp did not carry much weight in this little town. So, we slipped on our sandals and just began to walk. After following the main road for a few minutes, we turned onto a street with a gelateria on the corner, and quickly found a pizzeria nearby.
We sat outside on a string-lit patio and soon began speaking with the waiter, who also happened to be the owner’s son. In contrast to the people working the service desk at the hotel, with whom we had to communicate through vague hand gestures, he spoke a great amount of English. It was a comforting revelation, since the town probably did not get many tourists coming from the US. So, taking advantage, my dad asked for dish recommendations. He told us to get a pizza each, as they were personal-sized and he could easily finish one or two. We probably should have known that his idea of personal would differ than ours, however, and when he brought them to the table, all my sister said was “it’s almost bigger than me!” I wasn’t complaining though; we ended up taking the leftovers for a late-night snack.
At the end of our delicious meal, we were greeted by another unexpected surprise. We began talking to the owner and his son about where we were from (Palo Alto, California), and the son’s face suddenly lit up. It turned out he had lived a couple miles away from us for ten years while working his past job, after which he decided to take some time to move back home and work with his father. Our meal then turned into a night of laughs and good conversation as we exchanged stories of California and got to know the family of the pizzeria.
Even in a seemingly random beach town, we found a connection to our home thousands of miles away. The unexpected link was a reminder that we live in a minuscule world where the owner of a pizza place you happen to stumble on in Tuscany could very well have once been your neighbor.

“You packed what for Rome in March?”
That was the customs officer, eyeing my linen jumpsuit and flip-flops as if I’d just stepped off a cruise ship in the Arctic. To be fair, I thought March in Italy meant early spring. Blossom-scented breezes. Aperol spritzes under the sun. The Colosseum is adorned with charming gowns.
Instead, I stepped into what felt like a chilly Roman version of Seattle. The wind whipped through my bones. Locals wrapped themselves in puffer jackets and scarves. And there I was, dragging my tiny carry-on and an overinflated ego through cobblestone streets in socks that were basically social distancing from warmth.
Let me save you the frostbite. Here’s what I wish someone had told me before that first trip.
Italy in March sounds like a dream: off-season travel, fewer crowds, blooming landscapes, cheaper everything. And yes, that part is true.
But what your dreamy Pinterest boards don’t tell you? March in Italy is moody. One moment you find yourself soaking up the golden sunlight on the Spanish Steps, and the next, you find yourself sprinting through an unexpected downpour. The weather changes its mind more often…

When I travel alone, I am the complete opposite of someone who obsessively plans every part of their journey. I obsessively try to avoid planning as much as humanly possible until the absolute last minute when I need to figure out what I’m supposed to do before my flight back home.
Back in Autumn 2023, during a month in Puglia, I suddenly felt I’d spent enough time eating focaccia in Bari, and decided to visit the coast of Salento, specifically a charming beachside town called Gallipoli. A few hours by local train later, passing through rolling hills and small charming Apuglian towns, I was there.
I walked around the historical center, ate pizza, and enjoyed the perfect weather and view of the beautiful Ionian Sea. None of my pictures do the place justice, especially considering I went to the beach without a camera or phone (since I went alone), so I was unable to capture the most magical sunset I have ever seen in my life — as the sun hit the horizon, a lone tree on a small island acted like the iris in a…

Seated backward on a high-speed TGV approaching the 8.5-mile-long Mont Cenis tunnel, I unwrapped a piece of Tome des Bauges I had purchased hours earlier at Chambéry’s Marché Des Halles.
Next to it on my tray table, I had a tiny baguette, given to me free at La Panière, just outside the Marché. Thankfully, the bistro on board offered wooden cutlery so that I could cut the rind.
I was even more grateful that the bistro sold a crisp Pays d’Oc chardonnay to accompany my 11 am snack.
This grassy, somewhat stinky cheese would be my last taste of the French Alps on this trip.
I would soon enter a tunnel that would take me under 6,000 feet of rock — pushed upward by tectonic collisions 30 million years ago — and when I emerged, I would be in Italy

GOSPEL songs — earworms! — play in my head constantly now after two intense weeks of learning them with a choir touring Tuscany. We weren’t a choir before we boarded our respective flights, but we are a choir now.
And right now I can ‘hear’ a very beautiful Italian prayer-song, Signore Delle Cime — Lord of the [mountain] Peaks — in my mind and I, a non-believer, am nevertheless deeply moved. Who wouldn’t be?
Signore Delle Cime asks the Lord to take ‘our friend’, a fallen mountaineer, up to heaven covered ‘with a soft white blanket’. It soars.
Then there was Bella Ciao, the rousing hymn of the partisans who would die for la liberta. It seems all Italians know that one.
The 30 singers in our choir are mostly Australian and we also have a sassy soprano from Canada who lives in New Zealand, three terrific tenors (Scotland, Canada and New Zealand), and an Irish lass, our scintillating soloist and queen of the altos, who lives in Melbourne.
We learned songs, mostly gospel in nature, in Italian, French, Samoan, Zulu (yes!) and English. And we performed a selection of them in two churches, one in the gentle medieval town of Mercatello sul Metauro in the Marche region that borders Tuscany, and another in Firenze. (The angelic altos are pictured above.)
Our maestros were exceptional talents — Guerrino Parri in Mercatello, Edoardo Materassi who taught us in the first week of our tour in Montestigliano, near Siena, and in Firenze, and Tony Backhouse, who taught us for the entire two weeks. Many readers will know Tony from his acclaimed Sydney-based choir, the Café at the Gates of Salvation Gospel Choir, as well as his Heavenly Light Quartet. That’s him, below, with Guerrino in the background getting ready to begin.
Each of these three conductors was a joy to watch at work. So knowledgeable — so animated! — and able to sing each part (bass, tenor, soprano, alto), they lifted us up with their energetic love of the music and of teaching it. What a joy.
Members of Guerrino’s choir in Mercatello joined us for our concert there, and in Firenze we were treated to exceptional performances by Edoardo’s choir, Animae Voces, who also joined us for some tunes.
Now I am in Anghiari, ‘my’ beloved medieval village near Arezzo, very happy to be here again so unexpectedly soon, thanks to one person dropping out of the singing tour before it began. [I spent last November and December here.] ‘Making Music in Italy’, organised by a Byron Bay-based outfit, The Create Escape, had been fully booked when I inquired about it months before. When I tossed my cap in, I assumed it unlikely that a spot would become available — but it did! So, with just four weeks to get myself prepared — flights, insurance, what to do after the tour, and so on — I said yes. Life is short, yes?
I have always eschewed the idea of group tours, but now I am very glad I took what felt like a leap of faith and dived in. The accommodation in Montestigliano, Mercatello and then Firenze was excellent and interesting in different ways; we ate sumptuous meals, had some lovely parties and stimulating side trips as well as the pleasure of learning. (You can see a snippet of one of those parties here.)
One of the side trips was to the hilltop restaurant Il Girone dei Golosi just out of Mercatello; another was to the beautiful organic winery Pomaio near the town of Arezzo where we went for lunch on the way to Firenze (see pics below).
I’m sure we all made some lovely new friends. (And here I must make special mention of Susie and David from the Northern Rivers who had the brilliant idea of making this tour the first leg of their honeymoon! It was a treat for all of us to have them along.)
Now I’ve seen more of Tuscany than I had before. It is my fifth time visiting Anghiari and I’ve opted to spend a month here to catch up with acquaintances I have come to know and love. After all, the airfare is just the same for six weeks as for two, isn’t it?
A presto. Mimi :)
PS: If you would like to see the choir in action, some parts of our concerts can be found on YouTube. Go to ‘Making Music in Italy, 2024’. You’re welcome. xx

It was June 2023 when I drove to Italy for 3 weeks to find a second house or a renovation project in Italy. I had sold my house in the Netherlands as I felt it was time to move forward without any mortgage. Freedom.
Initially I was focussed on moving to Spain. My boyfriend’s native language is Spanish, and learning Spanish is already a challenge. Putting another language in the mix like Italian, didn’t feel very useful. Long story short, I couldn’t get a homy feeling in Spain, and I always loved and felt connected with Italy. Italy it was.
Like many house searchers, Idealista is a great way to start. With a long list of 50+ houses I drove to my preferred area around Lucca and further up the coast in Liguria. Obviously many houses weren’t at all what they seemed online, but more, I couldn’t see myself living in those areas. Secondly, I was all over the place with what I was looking for: a nice holiday home or a golden gem like a big mansion to renovate.
Having one week left, I went back to the heart of Piemonte where I had spent the first 2 nights. I ended up in a B&B owned and run by Francesca. We clicked and I loved the area: the rolling soft hills with its vineyards, the laid back little villages with one bar in the center as the communal place to meet each other for coffee or an aperitivo.
I visited some more houses in the area but nothing came even close to making my heart jump a tiny bit with excitement. This is not the right way, I felt. Let’s reverse the process: stop hunting, trust that life will show me what or where to look next. As a side note, I always bought the houses I lived in very intuitively, which has never let me down. In fact, it has given me a lot of financial expansion over the years.
I just posted my ‘I trust the universe’ post on facebook when the cousin of Francesca stepped into the garden. 10 minutes later, he offered to show me his house down the road that he bought a year ago. Would I be interested to buy his house as his plans had changed?
Is this a sign? Curious as I am, I said that I would be open to explore. It wasn’t love at first sight. It wasn’t the Liberty House from early 20th century with heigh painted ceilings I was hoping to find, but it was huge! And that ignited my interior design excitement. I love a good renovation challenge! I have had my design business for 13 years, and although I never see myself in that role again, I love to be my own client!
3 Months later I signed the contract, and became resident in one day. The house, with a potential of 600m2 living space and 14000 m2 land, was mine. Definitely a design challenge as 40% of the house, the barn with its hay attic, needs a complete transformation. For Italian standards the whole process went very smoothly, mainly due to great help I received from the seller!
Why did I say yes? It just felt like the one thing to do. Not just buying it, but to move out of the Netherlands immediately and start something new. It all felt right: the potential of the house with 7–8 bedrooms and the potential for an equal number of bathrooms, living spaces to share and some to keep private, enough space for my children to come and stay, alone or with their friends and the idea of creating a business sanctuary, whatever that will be…I felt a new phase opened up. How exciting!
Back to the summer of 2023. My partner wasn’t as thrilled as I was when I showed him the house the first time. Understandable! His favourite spot to visit, the Netherlands, was suddenly swapped for a rural area with a bunch of farmers. Having a long distance relationship for 6 years now, travelling between Lima-Peru and The Netherlands very frequently, has worked well for us, but will it be the same with my drastic move?
While I didn’t really involve my partner in the decision, I did involve my 3 (young adult) children! Perhaps not realising the complete impact of this move, they were supportive of my choice. I feel blessed with their ability to give me this space although it certainly hasn’t always been easy for them for different reasons.
So here I am, 14 months later. A year of learning and rooting. Slowly learning the language. Connecting with the ground I live on. Making the house with simple means a home for now until the renovation is done. Enjoying the simplicity of life in the country. Meeting so many beautiful new people, of which a few are becoming good friends.
And of course, not everything goes easy and smoothly. My renovation started with a classic mistake, trusting the wrong person and ignoring my inner doubt as I was too eager to get started. It has cost me quite a sum of money with which I had come to terms with for myself. I felt so angry and frustrated but also a bit ashamed with my mistake. Shouldn’t I know better as an experienced renovator and intuitive person?
I stopped working with the first contractor, continued with his collaborating partner (as he was a victim of the whole situation as well) to finish the terraces and new swimming pool. Normally one starts with the house and the outer areas are last on the list. For sure it will turn out quite unpractical to have a new terrace while the whole house needs to be taken care of, but I am so happy I enjoyed a first summer with a lovely space outside and my beautiful new swimming pool. At least the pool can’t fall of the budget anymore! A lovely first summer, sharing it all with friends, family, and of course my children.
While I moved on my own to a country where I didn’t know anyone, I can’t say I ever felt alone or lonely. In fact, in between all the visits, and my own travelling to the Netherlands, Peru and some other places, I am happy to have some weeks on my own. I love the different seasons: fresh sunny spring, warm rain free summer, foggy autumn mornings and cold winters with the snowy mountains of the Alps as a postcard view from my terrace.
And the house? For a while I didn’t want to renovate it at all. I live so comfortably already, and I have enough rooms for guests to stay. My youngest spontaneously brought 7 friends for a week around New Years Eve. My son enjoyed a week in the summer with 6 of his friends! And you know, sharing 2 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms worked fine for everyone.
But after a few months, I felt the excitement bubbling up for the next phase of the renovation. I refreshed my skills so I could use my design software again. It had been a while but I really loved solving this big puzzle. How to make the best out of the house. This part had always been my favourite element of my interior business: creating the most optimal living spaces, a natural flow, all within the limits of the building and a budget. To me it is the definition of simplicity: creating such a design that solves all complexity (integrate all wishes affordably, elegantly, beautifully and within the limited space) while the results looks very natural like the house has always meant to be like that. In other words, I don’t like over designed houses for the sake of creating something new and expensive.
The house had grown on me, which made me change some of my initial ideas. I finalised the complete design in September. Now what? How to find the right contractor(s) this time? One that is flexible to find affordable and beautiful solutions: my budget is limited and my standard is high! But more importantly, finding one who is willing to work differently from the very bureaucratic way that is known in Italy and very costly in my view.
I did hire a geometra. A geometra works within the triangle of the municipality, the contractor and the house owner. A geometra can easily take 15–20% of the budget as an add on! That is excluding the costs for an architect, an interior designer and an engineer (for constructive calculations). I decided to hire my geometra only for the permit, the (ridiculous but mandatory) safety and security rules and some engineering guidance. I followed the same process as I did in the Netherlands for many years to receive budget proposals from 4 contractors. Well, that already made a pre-selection. Two of them resigned as they didn’t like my way. They would only give a quote based on the standard procedure here where the geometra prepares the whole costing format. Basically this means, they only have to fill in the price per item and you get a very clear overview per contractor what his offering is. Sounds great and good for comparing budgets, but quite costly for me and way less flexible.
Now I am left with 2 parties who both feel like good companies to work with. One of them is very eager to grow his business and the other has an established contracting business. I haven’t finalised the deals yet, but it feels like the project will be divided amongst these 2 parties.
I am excited to get started, to work with the workers wherever I can, find solutions and the right materials. I am best when I can design the little details in the moment.
Please follow along in this blog to read about my weekly updates, surprises, joys, fun facts and challenges as I navigate this BIG project!

We had promised our son that we would take him to Italy, especially since we named him after our memorable trip to the country over a decade ago. In 2024, we finally embarked on an 8-day journey to Italy, keeping our commitment to our beloved son and eager to share our past experiences with our kids.
(You can also read this article on my travel blog — GracefulTrips.com)
Upon arriving in Rome, we took the train to Florence, using it as our base for exploring nearby cities such as Siena, San Gimignano, and Pisa. We also took some time to explore Florence, known as the capital of artists. Afterward, we took the train back to Rome and visited all the famous historical sites before flying back home.
This article will list the cities we visited, not necessarily in chronological order.
We signed up for a walking tour, the best way to learn about this area. The guide showed us what all the buildings used to be and the stories behind them.
We could see the prints by the chariots and the original bricks on the streets (the ones marked with the letter V).

Been working in italy since 2014. Tipping was frowned upon. Then cover charges started popping up. Just got back after 3 weeks in Rome, Florence, and Rimini and EVERY restaurant had cover charges. At one restaurant the GS (servizo incluso) on checks plus the coperto (cover charge) equaled 50% of what I paid. I spent more between them than I do paying 20% in the US. I didn’t get back to France and Spain this year and wonder if they are doing the same?

A few days before Christmas, Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli was welcomed back to Earth after a long tour on the International Space Station.
During his four-and-a-half months he posted some of the most amazing photos and images of Italy from space… And he became the first astronaut in space to make pizza aboard the International Space Station.
With the end of his latest tour on the International Space Station, Nespoli has spent so far a total of 313 days, 2 hours, and 36 minutes in space.
We can’t thank him enough for his photos and the amazing posts on social media.
To celebrate the upcoming new year, Italy, and the beauty of our country, and to thank Nespoli and all Italian astronauts, we decided to publish a mini collection of some of the most beautiful images of Italy from space, as logged by Nespoli and other astronauts in 2017.

Out my window in New York I can see a tall white slice of a building where the Russian diplomatic corps lives. In that contained compound, there’s also a long, low building with a big round window, a school for their children. What are the mindsets of people there — especially when they see protesters waving the Ukraine flag across the street? What kind of history lessons do they teach those kids?
I mention this curious, closed-off world because it’s the kind of environment that can send fiction writers down long trails of exploration. And if all their research and imaginings lead to a vivid, unusual tale, readers may scratch their heads and wonder how the heck the writer came up with it.
When I read a new novel by Paolo Bacigalupi, Navola, I did some of that proverbial head scratching. It’s set in an alternative version of Renaissance Italy, filled with deception, vast wealth, and cut-throat power plays. So many questions surfaced in my mind, which led to some unexpected discoveries.
Before getting into that, here’s a little bit about Bacigalupi and the novel. If you’re a sci-fi fan, you might have gone head-over-heels for his first published novel, The Windup Girl, which picked up two of the most prized awards in the genre, a Hugo and a Nebula, along with other honors. Maybe you read some of his work that came after that — until he disappeared from the literary scene. Then last year, he rose up once again with Navola.
This marks the first time that Bacigalupi has dived into the fantasy genre. He sidestepped many of the usual suspects — magic spells, knights, princesses, witches, elves. But he did dust off the old dragon trope and gave it a strange quality. We first learn about it in the book’s opening paragraph, which begins:
“My father kept a dragon eye upon his desk. An orb larger than a man’s skull, gone milky and crystalline but still burning with inner fire as if it retained life.”
MISFIT IN A POWERFUL FAMILY
The narrator is a boy, and later a young man, born into a banking family. The young scion, Davico, may be extraordinarily wealthy, but he can’t meet the huge expectations of the father he so reveres. Davico is educated in warfare and how to perceive the dark secrets that are rife in Navola, the city-state where he lives. He pushes himself to become a master negotiator and to achieve far-reaching knowledge about all the bank’s clients. But he seems to always fall short. His passions and natural gifts lie elsewhere.
One of his gifts has to do with that dragon’s eye. The relic isn’t mentioned very frequently and seems inert to everyone but Davico, who senses its pent-up power. It seems like it’s going to do something. But what? I read much later into the night than I should have, wondering about that.
Another reason for my sleep deprivation had to do with a character named Celia. She arrives just after Davico’s father wreaks revenge against her family, which had plotted to overthrow his power. The father decides to adopt Celia, giving Davico an unexpected sister. It makes for an awkward introduction.
Over the course of the novel, Celia transforms from a subdued, quiet girl into a vivacious wit who is able to navigate through the treacherous, opulent world much more easily than Davico.
A third reason why I couldn’t stop reading relates to Bacigalupi’s master skills of foreshadowing, teasing the reader about what’s to come without giving much away. Consider the confessional tone of Davico in this passage, which is addressed to his readers:
“I have lost interest in hiding who I was or what I have become. I am tired of the lies and excuses, and wish only to lay myself bare before you, so that you at least will understand, even if you do not forgive.”
In addition to all my curiosity about where the book was headed, I also started to wonder about Bacigalupi’s inspirations and how the book had come about. It was so different than what I’d read of his other work.
It wasn’t hard to discern that novel’s world was some ancient version of Italy. Bacigalupi also invented certain words, gestures and body markings that seemed to borrow from Italian culture. But where was that all coming from? With a name like Paolo Bacigalupi, I assumed that he had an Italian family history. I was wrong.
My research uncovered an unexpected set of circumstances. Navola’s storyline came to him at a time when he was no longer interested in exploring the sci-fi topics he’d become known for, like changes in the world due to extreme weather and bioengineering.
‘NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,’ NEW AVENUE
He explained his mindset in a Write-Minded podcast interview: “A lot of the [future] trends that my brain locks onto are the frightening ones. And so you end up spending time being sort of anxious in your daily life. And then you go into this creative space where you actually expand on those anxieties and go deeper and deeper into them. And it builds this sort of, I don’t know, synergistic toxicity. And eventually I just broke down, fundamentally. I kind of had a nervous breakdown.”
A new way forward gained momentum during a trip to Italy with a friend, who wanted to learn Italian by living in Bologna. Bacigalupi had gone along for the ride. But it turned into so much more than that. Italian architecture and history proved fertile ground for his imagination, and that’s so evident in Navola’s landscape.
“One of the things about Bologna was all these rival families in the city would build these towers, and they were defensive towers for their families, but they were also statements of wealth and importance,” he told Locus magazine in a December 2024 article.
“The landscape is telling you something about politics, saying, ‘Oh, this city is not a cohesive political unit, even though you’ve got a wall that goes around the whole city — inside it, there are armed factions who war with each other, and retreat into their towers when they’re unsafe, then come out and attack each other. They’d imprison one another in their towers, all sorts of stuff. You can see this layer of anarchy clearly established in the architecture, and that’s not something that I would have organically thought of, but it’s something that I could observe and then steal and bring into my own world.”
There was at least one unexplored story thread in Navola that I kept waiting to play out as the pages turned. And while it never did, I suspect it was a little hint about what’s to come. At the time he was interviewed by Locus, Bacigalupi had written 60,000 to 80,000 words of a sequel book. As with Navola, it will be published by Knopf.
“I’m going to let the story be as long as it wants to be. If I need to go back to Knopf and offer another book, I’ll do that. If I can wrap it up elegantly in two, I’ll do that,” he said at that time. “I’m trying to be as loose as I can with it and allow the thing to take on the shape that it wants.”
With or without that dragon’s eye, I’ll be waiting.

That’s what a friend told me before I went to my next travel destination, and she was right. It was summer in England, but it did not feel like it (knowing English weather ☺), so a quick summer getaway to Lake Como seemed like a good idea. And mind you, Italy never disappoints.
For my first photo blog, I would like to share my experience of my recent trip to Lake Como. Lake Como, or Lago di Como in Italian, is located in the Lombardy region in the northern part of Italy. It is surrounded by different towns, and visually, it looks like an inverted Y when you look at it on the map. Popular for its beautiful waters, majestic grand villas and gorgeous Italian towns, it has always been a favourite summer destination for locals and tourists around the world.
There are several towns surrounding the lake, and the most popular ones are Varenna, Bellagio, Menaggio and Como. For this trip I decided to stay in Varenna for its strategic location and more peaceful scenery compared to other major towns. I stayed in Lake Como for 4 days. I know it might not be long enough because there are still lots to see and explore.
How I got there:
I travelled from London Heathrow to Milan Malpensa airport since the nearest and most convenient airport to reach Lake Como. After landing in Milan, it took fifty minutes to an hour via train from Milan Centrale to reach Varenna. You can buy your train tickets from the airport or by using the Trenitalia app on your mobile phone. My advice is to book your tickets via the app in advance because train tickets might be difficult to book, especially during peak seasons. Trains usually depart every hour, and a one-way ticket costs me 11 euros for a first-class seat. To be honest, I’m not sure if it was too hot in Italy at that time, that the temperature in the train was too warm as well. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant journey overall.
Where I stayed:
I decided to stay in the town of Varenna in the eastern part of the Lake. My stay in the town was pleasant and calm, probably because of the smaller crowd since there were fewer restaurants and establishments in the area. There were different accommodations to choose from, ranging from high-cost hotels to cheaper, but still comfy ones. Just a quick warning, though, there were several areas in Italy where air conditioning in hotel buildings was regulated at specific times of the year. Be sure to do your research before choosing your accommodation. My hotel was a 5-minute walk from Varenna Train Station, which was also a big plus for me.
What I did:
There were several exciting activities that you can do in Lake Como. It ranges from walking tours, visiting Italian architectures on each town, visiting beautiful villas via boat tours, dipping into the lake and many more.
First Stop
After checking in the hotel, I went straight to a pre-booked tour of two of the most beautiful Villas in Varenna, Villa Monastero and Hotel Villa Cipressi. Roaming around Villa Monastero, you can see the attractive garden and the majestic view of Lake Como. The view of the lake was so stunning, and I’m sure you will be amazed too. It’s one reason why many movies were filmed here, like Oceans Twelve, Casino Royale and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.
I went straight to Hotel Villa Cipressi and enjoyed the view of the garden and the lake while sipping Aperol Spritz and eating Italian panini! Truly Dolce Vita! The Villa is part of a hotel that has a restaurant and bar open to both guests and non-guests. There were so many Instagrammable spots in both villas, and I recommend that you visit them.
After visiting the villas, I explored Varenna on foot to see what this town has to offer. I went to the town centre and there were couple of restaurants along the lake shore. The place was a bit crowded since it was summertime but still manage to roam around and find amazing spots, fancy restaurants and local stores.
The lake view was so serene especially during golden hours. It was so pristine and calming for the senses and worth capturing on your camera lenses.
As I walked back to my hotel, I saw group of people enjoying the sun and having a dip in the lake. I should have brought my swimming trunks and sunscreen with me ha-ha.
I ended up the day having authentic Italian pizza and a glass, uhm okay glasses of red wine ha-ha.
There will be more stories to come in the second part of my Lake Como journey. Hope you enjoyed this short blog and can’t wait to share the rest in the next part! Thanks for reading!

Favorite Chocolate Shops in Italy
With Valentine’s Day, thoughts turn to chocolate. Here’s an excerpt from “100 Places in Italy Every Woman Should Go” to help you find the best places for chocolate in Italy…
“Let them eat chocolate,” was the kind proclamation of Madama Reale.
The year was 1678. Madama Reale was thirty years old, widowed, with a boy to raise, and had become the ruler of the Piedmont region in northern Italy. She took her job seriously and carried on major beautiful changes to the city during her reign , continuing in the tradition her husband had began, remodeling the Palazzo Madama into pretty French style.
In Madama Reale’s day chocolate was a precious novelty served only to royalty and priests. It had come to Italy through the Spanish explorer Cortez, who found it in South America.
When a Turin baker asked Madame Reale’s permission to make chocolate for regular folk, I imagine she figured, “Why not?” She probably needed the seritonin fix to deal with the hassles of being a female ruler and wanted to pass on the high to keep her popularity ratings up.

Or how a Balinese priest told me who I would marry
“There’s a wonderful old Italian joke about a poor man who goes to church every day and prays before the statue of a great saint, begging, ‘Dear saint — please, please, please… give me the grace to win the lottery.’ This lament goes on for months. Finally the exasperated statue comes to life, looks down at the begging man and says in weary disgust, ‘My son — please, please, please… buy a ticket.”
That profound realisation is from the blockbuster book Eat Pray Love. In the iconic movie scene, Julia Roberts says these words while overlooking ancient Rome. I have seen this film time and again, but I didn’t realise it until last year — did I just relive Eat Pray Love itself?
Dear saint, I did buy three tickets years apart… to Italy, India and Bali… and my lottery is a prophecy.
Italia… amore a prima vista! I was a teenager on my birthday when I first set foot in Italy. The fact that I don’t recollect the exact year is evidence that I speak of time long passed. It was a high school trip and my highlight was Casa di Giulietta (or Juliet’s house) in Verona. I revive the memory of a line of people flocking to this medieval tiny courtyard with one wish in mind — to find true love. Standing before the statue of Juliet, supposedly where Romeo wooed her, I was observing how everybody was writing their names on a wall, followed by symbols and dates important for them, as well as the name of their crush, husband or partner.
And then there was me. I found myself in front of the wall with a pen in my hand. I wrote ‘’Mila’’ followed by a tiny doodle of a heart. And then I looked up to the sky and set out the following intention ‘’I left the space next to my name empty. Let whoever is meant to be with me, write their name next to mine. And let the universe do its magic and introduce me to that person in divine timing.’’ Something inside of me as a young girl told me that I was probably the only one who did that.
But the woman in me today knows who wrote their name next to mine.
Namaste, India! It was my 21st birthday. The land of contrast. The thing about India is that you either love it or you never want to go back. I fall in the first category. I call to mind entering a Hindu temple for the first time in my life. ‘’No phones allowed’’ — it said on a very high fence. As a 21-year-old just entering the era of Instagram this is the last thing you want to hear. ‘’Well, I don’t have a choice’’ — I said to myself while proceeding to entering the temple. If you have been to India, you know that New Delhi is chaotic. Yet, somehow this Hindu temple was the trailer to how tranquillity feels like in the hustle and bustle of the big city.
The only time before that I was in awe of a building was in Barcelona when I entered La Sagrada Família. But Akshardham Temple in Delhi was something magical. This was the exact moment when I fell in love with India, Hinduism and Asia. I stood in front of the central sanctum and in a trice I couldn’t see anyone else. It was just me and this massive gold statue before me. The entire world went still. It was a fleeting moment, but it was something that I couldn’t explain to myself. What I know for sure, though, is that if I had my phone with me I wouldn’t have had this memory.
Om Swastiastu, Bali! I had to go back to Asia. The older you grow, the more life pushes you to search for peace, meaning and answers. ‘’Om Swastiastu, Miss Mila, my name is Ketut, nice to meet you.’’ No way. Did he say Ketut? I just rewatched the movie Eat Pray Love (which is by the way based on a true story) on my flight to Bali and if you have seen it, you know who Ketut is in the story. To make the picture even more unbelievable, Ketut that stood before me is a local priest in Ubud.
One morning, before inviting me to a Balinese family celebration that happens only once every 30 years, we had a talk about life. I shared that I wanted to visit a local palm reader. Sometimes when you’re desperate, you look for answers from places you never thought you would run to. ‘’I do’’ — he said, ‘’but you don’t have time for this today… have you visited The Pyramids of Chi? I think you should go’’ — said Ketut, accompanied by a witty smile, as if he almost knew what would happen there.
Like I wrote in another article, the gods always travel incognito. Ketut was convincing in an almost demanding way, leaving me with no choice but to go to those pyramids. I went to the reception and asked for a ticket for the first session available. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was in a pyramid built on top of a rice field, about to meditate to the sound of a gong. And let me tell you — I was the type of person that could never do yoga or meditate.
I still find it hard to put into words what happened to me that morning. I started having visions, one of which was a very specific necklace with a lotus flower. Once the session was over and it almost felt like I just woke up for the first time in my life, my legs took me to the giftshop. And guess what — that exact necklace I saw in my meditation was sold at their shop! I got goosebumps. A receptionist approached me and said to me ‘’Miss, this is the last necklace.’’ Nothing is a coincidence and signs do exist.
A year later, fate took me to Bali again, despite planning to go to Thailand instead. I had to go back to those pyramids again. I needed more answers. It was not an easy task to revisit a place without the burden of the expectations from the first time. However, I told myself that if those visions are a reality and not just my mind playing tricks on me, I must see the number 17 immediately when I leave the pyramid.
The sound healing was done. I ran to grab a piece of my favourite peanut butter chocolate cake and drink a comforting cup of ceremonial cacao. The woman at the counter handed me a note with a number and told me to put it on the table so they know where to bring my order. I grabbed it without looking and started playing with a frangipani flower that fell next to me. I sat down, a waiter brought my cake and to my astonishment I looked up — the table number I was given was… 17. And next to the cake the word ‘’love’’ was written with strawberry jam.
Then I went back to my homestay and Ketut asked me the mandatory question of how my day was. How do I tell this man that he sent me to a place that changed my life? I was looking for a palm reader, but I ended up being my own palm reader. What really made my jaw dropped was what Ketut asked me. ‘’Mila, do you have a partner?’’ and before I could even respond he continued — ‘’You have already met him, I saw him’’ and then with that same smile he gave me last year, he walked away and wished me good night. He saw him? What did he mean?
I don’t really have an ending for this story. An ending would imply that a cycle is completed. Yet, why does it feel like this cliffhanger by a Balinese priest is just the beginning? Or maybe I myself started this prophecy by writing my name on a wall in Italy over 14 years ago? And… what if maybe he also told me who I will marry?
Let’s connect!

The Alps are the highest and the most extensive mountain group in Europe, extending across 8 countries: France, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia.
In this chapter, I focus on the road trip I did last year on the first nine days of May, driving from Southeast Switzerland to northern Italy, Tyrol Austria and Liechtenstein. If you prefer only to visit the Swiss Alps click here.
The last stop in Switzerland before crossing the border to Italy.
Lake Como
Driving along the lake’s road through the towns of Domaso, Menaggio, Lenno, Laglio…and at the southern tip Como, where we stayed a night.
Picturesque and romantic city
Lake Endine
A smaller lake also in Lombardy and the perfect stop to stretch our legs and have a lunch break before reaching Lake Iseo.
Lake Iseo
Views to Mont Isola at the island of Lake Iseo were breathtaking so we decided to stay here for the night.
Hiking trails connecting very small ancient villages, old churches, and olive fields with sheep and donkeys.
Lake Garda
Lazise
Bardolino and Malcesine
Riva del Garda
Famous for its beaches, swimming, sailing, windsurfing, hiking and cycling holidays. Here you can paraglide too.

Trento, Bolzano and Merano landscapes
Gardens of Trauttmansdorff Castle in Merano
In these gardens so carefully taken care of, you will find flora from different parts of the world, a labyrinth, educational games, experimental landscaping, a restaurant with tasty soup by the lake and views to Tyrol as a background knowing that Austria is right on the other side.
Sterzing — Vipiteno
Hiking in the morning and local market and shops in Vipiteno´s center in the afternoon before crossing the border to Austria.
“Tyrol is a western Austrian state in the Alps that’s known for its ski resorts, historic sites, and folk traditions.” Innsbruck is its capital.
Innsbruck
Ischgl
A famous ski resort, the season had ended a week before we visited it.
St. Anton am Berg villages
Feldkirch
Vaduz is the capital of Liechtenstein or officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, a small country located in an alpine valley along the Rhine river. 38,557 German-speaking inhabitants.
Vaduz
We decided to visit the city half day, walking around the center and visiting the Museum of Art: Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein and Liechtenstein National Museum. Here you discover the Arts, Crafts, and History of this micro-estate.
Italy, and the spring and first love all together should suffice to make the gloomiest person happy.
- Bertrand Russell

Italy is an extraordinary country that blends history, art, culture, cuisine, and natural beauty in an unparalleled manner. From its ancient ruins to its vibrant cities and picturesque landscapes, Italy has captivated the hearts of millions. In this article, we will explore the various aspects that make Italy unique, from its rich history to its diverse regional offerings.
Italy is often called the birthplace of Western civilization. The ruins of ancient Rome, providing remnants of its powerful empire, speak to its historical significance. The Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon are not just tourist attractions; they are testaments to a bygone era that shaped architecture, governance, and law in many parts of the world.
The Renaissance period flourished in Italy, primarily in cities like Florence, Venice, and Milan. This cultural movement saw the emergence of remarkable artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, whose works have left an indelible mark on art and culture globally. The legacy of the Renaissance continues to influence modern design, art, and literature.
Italy boasts an astronomical number of art treasures. The Vatican Museums, showcasing works by Raphael and Michelangelo, are one of the most visited destinations in the world. Additionally, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence houses masterpieces from the likes of Botticelli and Titian. The sheer volume of artistic genius within Italy’s borders is unmatched.
Italy’s architecture is as diverse as its regions. The iconic Leaning Tower of Pisa, the intricate Gothic facades of Milan Cathedral, and the romantic canals of Venice star in the country’s architectural repertoire. Furthermore, the charm of small medieval towns, with their cobbled streets and historic buildings, add to Italy’s architectural allure.
Italian cuisine is celebrated worldwide, but what makes it distinctively unique is its regional diversity. From the rich risottos of Northern Italy to the fresh seafood of the Amalfi Coast, each region offers unique flavors and traditions. Dishes like pizza, pasta, and gelato have their roots in specific locales, showcasing the country’s culinary heritage.
Italian culinary excellence is tied to its commitment to high-quality, local ingredients. Olive oil, fresh vegetables, cheeses, and meats play a crucial role in traditional dishes. The Mediterranean lifestyle, which is intrinsic to Italian culture, emphasizes a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, promoting wellness and enjoyment of food.
Italy’s landscapes are incredibly varied. From the rolling hills of Tuscany, adorned with vineyards and olive groves, to the stunning cliffs of the Amalfi Coast, the country’s natural beauty is breathtaking. The Dolomites in the North attract outdoor enthusiasts with their rugged peaks, while the serene beaches in Sardinia offer a slice of paradise.
Italy is home to the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world, with over 58 sites. This includes the picturesque landscapes of the Cinque Terre, the historical and architectural wonders of Venice, and the cultural landscapes of the Val d’Orcia. Each site tells a story of the intertwined relationship between nature and human creativity.
Italy’s cultural calendar is sprinkled with festivals that showcase the nation’s heritage and local traditions. Events such as Carnevale in Venice and the Palio di Siena draw crowds with lively parades, colorful costumes, and thrilling horse races. These festivals provide insight into the local way of life, uniting communities in shared joy and celebration.
Italian culture places a strong emphasis on family and community. Meals are often shared events, where multiple generations gather to enjoy traditional dishes. This communal spirit fosters a sense of belonging and reinforces the importance of relationships in everyday life.
Italian is often considered one of the most beautiful languages in the world. Its melodic tones and expressive vocabulary contribute to its uniqueness. The language is also a significant part of Italy’s identity, with numerous dialects reflecting the rich diversity of various regions.
Italy has a rich literary tradition, with significant contributions from authors such as Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Umberto Eco. The literary works originating from Italy often explore themes of love, philosophy, and human experience, reflecting the nation’s diverse cultural heritage.
Italy is synonymous with high fashion. Cities like Milan are considered global fashion capitals, housing revered designers such as Valentino, Prada, and Gucci. The Milan Fashion Week is a pivotal event in the fashion industry, showcasing cutting-edge designs and trends.
Beyond fashion, Italian design is celebrated in industries such as automotive (Ferrari, Maserati), furniture, and architecture. Italian designers prioritize functionality while maintaining a strong emphasis on aesthetics, leading to innovative and timeless creations.
Some of the top tourist destinations include Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, and the Amalfi Coast. Each of these locations offers unique attractions, historical landmarks, and cultural experiences.
The best time to visit is typically during the spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) when the weather is pleasant, and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak summer months.
It is advisable to dress smartly in Italy, especially when dining out or attending religious sites. Comfortable walking shoes are also essential for exploring cities and towns.
Must-try dishes include pizza Napoletana, pasta carbonara, risotto alla Milanese, and gelato. Each region has its specialties, so be sure to explore local cuisines.
Overall, Italy is considered a safe country for tourists. However, it’s wise to stay vigilant and take standard precautions against pickpockets, especially in crowded areas.
Italy’s unique blend of history, culture, cuisine, and stunning landscapes continues to inspire travelers from all over the world. The country’s rich tapestry makes it not only a destination but also a profoundly dynamic experience that lingers in the hearts and minds of those who visit.

Italy is a beautiful country, full of history, culture, and delicious food. But what if I told you that you can explore and enjoy this country to the fullest without compromising on your lifestyle as a digital nomad? As someone who has stayed in over 2000 hotels across Italy, I specialize in finding mid-range accommodations with a budget of €60–110 per night, focusing on 3 or 4-star hotels. My experience has taught me to strike a balance between comfort and cost, making the most out of each stay without going to extremes.
In this article, I’ll share with you some of the best tips and tricks I’ve learned along the way. But this is just the beginning! Throughout this series, we’ll go beyond the basics of “where to stay” and “what to eat,” diving into the practicalities of living well on the road: how to maximize your experience, find hidden gems, and maintain a high quality of life that goes beyond mere survival.
Who Am I?
I’m a digital nomad with a unique perspective. I work as a technical consultant for a multinational company, splitting my time between freelance projects and a steady job that takes me all over Italy — and sometimes beyond. Because of my work, I’m always on the move, and I’ve made it my mission to find the best places to live, eat, and work remotely, no matter where I am.
But unlike some digital nomads, I’m not willing to live like a “poor man” nomad, squeezing myself into the cheapest hostels and cutting corners just to get by. I also refuse to become a “digital hermit,” living in isolation away from the pulse of the cities. Instead, I aim to thrive — finding a balance between comfort, productivity, and enjoyment. And that’s what I want to share with you in this series.
What Does It Cost to Travel Well in Italy?
Let’s start with the basics: What does it cost to travel well in Italy? I’m not talking about scraping by on a tight budget. I’m talking about a lifestyle that includes good food, nice hotels, and experiences that leave you feeling fulfilled.
How to Travel Around Italy Efficiently
Italy’s public transportation system is good, but knowing how to navigate it can save you a lot of time and stress. However, unlike many digital nomads, I don’t often find myself traveling between big cities like Rome and Milan, where trains are ideal, or from Rome to Catania, where a plane would be the obvious choice.
Why and when Traveling by Car is Essential in Italy
Unlike in many other countries, my job rarely takes me to the major hubs like Rome or Milan, where trains and planes would be the most practical options. Instead, I travel to small towns and villages off the beaten path — places that are hard to reach by public transportation. If you’re in a similar line of work, it’s crucial to understand that the car becomes your lifeline.
Driving in Italy is not only a practical necessity but also a way to fully experience the country. Italy is densely populated and full of charming towns and villages that are worth exploring. Driving to get your groceries or grabbing a beer in a small village becomes an unparalleled experience!
Given the layout and structure of Italian towns, unless you want to be a “caravan nomad” moving with public transportation, a car is essential. And if you enjoy driving as much as I do, it’s an experience to cherish rather than a burden. Italy is not like Spain, where cities are spread out and public transport is a more viable option. Here, the car is strategic. I’ll share with you some tips on how to make the most of it and save money while you’re at it.
Tips for Enjoying Your Hotel Stays
One of the perks of my job is staying in a wide variety of hotels. Whether it’s a 5-star luxury resort or a small boutique hotel in a hidden village, I’ve learned a few tricks to make every stay more enjoyable:
The Joy of Exploring Small Towns in Italy
One of the true joys of traveling around Italy is exploring its many small towns and villages. Every region has its own charm, and the people are often warm and welcoming. The best part? Even in the most remote locations, you’ll rarely feel isolated. Unlike in some other countries, where you can feel like a stranger in the countryside, in Italy you’re more likely to be invited to a local event or to share a meal.
This is why you’ll never feel like a “digital hermit” in Italy — unless you choose to be. The density of the towns and the hospitality of the people make it easy to connect, network, and create meaningful experiences, no matter where you are.
Wrapping It Up
Italy has so much to offer, and it’s possible to experience it all without compromising on quality. This is just the beginning of a series of articles where I’ll explore various Italian and European destinations, sharing what it truly means to live well as a digital nomad.
Stay tuned for more articles where I’ll dive deeper into specific cities and regions, sharing hidden gems, recommended hotels, and, of course, the best places to eat. Because living like a digital nomad shouldn’t be about “making do” — it should be about living well.

Buongiorno! One of my favourite countries in this world? Italy! Pizza, pasta, and wine in masses, all under the dry heat of the sun with some of the most lovely people on earth.
This is one of my favourite places on earth, hands down. It is the kind of Tuscan village you see in movies and on postcards. Driving there on the street with cypress trees on both sides takes you back in time. Yes, this village is a little touristy but it is gorgeous and when in Tuscany, you need to go here. Nestled in green nature near the Mediterranean Sea you can find small restaurants, cafes, gelato, interior decor shops, wine and Italian specialities, it has everything your touristy Italian heart could ever desire. Go to the cafe in the middle of the town and treat yourself to an Espresso con Coretto (or with Grappa, they have both) with some Cantuccini or pastry of choice. Get lovely Ice Cream (the Bolgheri flavour is mouth-watering). Take a little sniff at the room perfumes in the interior store left from the gate.

This article was originally published in Spanish and you are invited to read it as well in my beautiful language here
I am not a psychologist. I could read a bunch of books to find answers to questions like why we enjoy dreaming, and why we love idealizing places, people, and situations… but I’m too lazy to do that.
All I know is that if you idealize your life, it’s probably because you like living in a self-generated Matrix avoiding some problem, denying it, or worse, you’ve always lived that way.
Nowadays, however, we have a huge choice of online resources, and it’s possible to get a real sense of what a place might be like: ideal for living or vacationing, boring or lively, safe or dangerous. You have the chance to even interact with its inhabitants long distance or, simply ask travelers about their experiences.
A few months ago a video of a girl went viral because she was complaining about how to get to Amalfi. She said she had to fly to Naples, take a train to Sorrento, a ferry to Amalfi, and finally climb lots of stairs to reach her hotel — all this in the height of summer, with that heat! Can you believe it?
She said influencers should be jailed for saying things that aren’t true… (deep breath…)
Here’s the thing: living is easy with eyes closed, but today you don’t have excuses. You have to be in the here and now. Whether it’s Instagram, YouTube, a book, or an article, you must remember that someone’s version of a place or an experience is subjective and probably idealized. You need to be aware that what you’re being sold on social media is either driven by economic convenience or because the person in question is feeding their delusion, trying to rope others into their fantasy.
You can’t plan your vacations, your life, or your career based on the ideas others give you. You have to go out into the world, connect with people, try, smell, ask, think critically, question, and then decide what to think, how to act, what to do, and where to go.
Mistakes are always lurking around the corner — you should always keep that in mind — but I can assure you that you’ll feel less frustrated knowing that you did everything yourself and consciously made the effort for your project to succeed.
Having said all this, I imagine you now understand why I said “No” in response to the title of this article.
But maybe I’m not so good at explaining my thesis, so here it is:
No, it’s not beautiful in Italy or anywhere else if you’ve decided to see life through filters, through the eyes of others — call them dream sellers, rich kids who study or live abroad, or immigrants who haven’t adapted to a new lifestyle or who’ve endured years of bitterness before achieving a decent standard of living and showing it off to you.
Life is beautiful only when you look at it with your own eyes and your ideas. It’s beautiful with both the good and the bad — not just when you see it through the Deep Summer filter.
Wake up!

Italy is often celebrated for its timeless art, history, and cuisine, but what truly makes this country special are the smaller, quieter experiences that usually go unnoticed. As an expat living amidst the Alps, I’ve discovered that there are countless opportunities to connect with nature, local traditions, and the changing seasons even in regions famed for their tourist attractions.
I forgot to tell you about my favourite event of the year here in the Alps: the narcissus flowering. There is something magical about seeing infinite meadows and feeling their perfume… By the way, I have a problem: I do not support many odors but the scent of narcissus I like and that is why I can say you that there is a big difference between the flowers that were 50 years ago and today: many flowers (and narcissus among them) do not have their fantastic profume they had when I was a girl.

I took a three-day trip to Italy on New Years. It was always my dream to visit the great Ancient Rome, so you can imagine how excited I was for this trip. Throughout my visit, I experienced some wonderful places, great food, and met new people. I want to share with you the rookie mistakes that I made, the things I did right, and ultimately what I learned from this experience. Here are some tips for navigating your way through the beautiful city of Rome.
Pack well (and right!!): Extra clothes, check, portable charger, check, type C, F, and L power outlet plugs, not check. Seriously, I spent the first half of my day there looking for electronic stores with the correct power outlet adapters. I made a rookie mistake, and hopefully, you will not have to.
Don’t pay extra. If anyone tries to convince you that you have to pay to get into the Vatican, I will assure you that you don’t. As soon as I arrived at the Vatican, I was unpleasantly approached by a man who apparently had only two tickets left to sell for the Vatican. Most might think that they “got lucky” and that they had just made it there in time before tickets were sold out, but that isn’t the case at all. Just keep your head up and walk right into the Vatican. It’s free. Thankfully, binge-watching travel videos on youtube helped me with that one.
Take lots of pictures. If you are traveling along, you can even ask tourists to take photos of you! As a solo traveler, I had plenty of time to soak in all the views and take my time appreciating all the sights and wonders. It is nice to take some pictures so you can reminisce later (who knows when you’ll be back). If you want to take some pictures of yourself, ask tourists if they’d be willing to take it for you, you’d be surprised how much photography talent there is in the crowd. If you see someone who could use a hand, offer to help them take their picture, they might offer to take yours back. Well, hey, it worked for me.
Plan well! I packed my day with wonderful sightseeing adventures and activities. It is crucial to check openings of the different places, especially on holidays. Unfortunately, I missed out on the great opportunity of seeing the Sistine Chapel because it was closed on the new year.
Throw a coin (or two) into the Trevi Garden. Legend has it that if you throw a coin over your head into the Trevi Fountain, chances are, you will return to Rome. If you throw two, you will return to Rome and fall in love, and three, you will return to Rome, fall in love, and get married there. I don’t know if this has been proven correct, but it can’t hurt to take your chances either way. Unluckily, I didn’t get to throw coins into the fountain, but have no doubt; I shall return.
Check out what Italy is known for, then make sure not to miss out. I enjoyed some delicious Italian Ice Cream, Pizza, and House Wine. The wine is incredibly affordable in Italy. While in the restaurant, don’t rush to receive the bill. It is customary in Italy to stick around and have a conversation after a nice meal.
Fly Ryanair! This one is a little bit controversial. If you asked me then if I would fly Ryanair again, I would have said that I would absolutely not. Looking back though, I realize how convenient it was to have a cheap flight from London to Rome. Just make sure you read exactly what you need to do when buying the ticket so they won’t charge you extra for late check-in or carry-on bags. If you don’t want to experience flight delays though, don’t fly with Ryanair. They might have cheaper flights, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost.
I hope asome of these travelling tips helped you out! I know that I need to take some of my own advice on my next trip to Rome.
Edit: This blog is a repost from 3 years ago when I first visited Rome. Hope you enjoy!

“Why are there so many tourist scammers? In the EU? How is that possible?!” I find myself pondering as I sit on a bench at Capitoline Hill in Rome, having just dismissed the fifth “salesman” hawking water/hats/bracelets/ whatever in the span of ten minutes. Perhaps equally surprising is the police who keep a few meters away but do not intervene.
“Consider this — by selling three bracelets they have an average hourly rate that could rival a much harder job in Glovo or something,” remarks my boyfriend having recently engaged in a lively argument with a guy offering him an African souvenir for free, which later suddenly appeared to cost “at least something”.
“But it’s illegal! It’s immoral! Do they have any respect for Italian culture? Or to humans at all? I simply couldn’t look up to the Colosseum because another guy f****d my mind forcing us to buy a ticket for the hop-on-hop-off bus!” I exclaim, my emotions getting the better of me. However, the worst was their pre-prepared reaction to every answer to the question “Where are you from?” My bad, I replied I was from Ukraine — and then they transformed the historic “Slava Ukraini” (“Glory to Ukraine”) into a cheap plea for me to…

Italy is a journey through history, a celebration of art, cuisine, and natural beauty. This summer, my family and I embarked on a two-week Italian adventure. From the ancient ruins of Rome to the enchanting canals of Venice, we were ready to uncover Italy’s timeless wonders. But, like any true adventure, it brought a few unexpected twists, a bittersweet farewell, and memories we’ll carry for a lifetime. Here’s a chronicle of our journey through history, heaven, and a touch of heartache.
Our trip took place in August, making it perfect for a family getaway. We dedicated two weeks to truly experience Italy from end to end. For planning, AI proved invaluable, offering detailed itineraries and personalized tips at every stage. With its help, we crafted an itinerary covering the major cities: Rome, the Amalfi Coast, Florence, and Venice.
Here is my prompt to AI. You could expect multiple follow up prompts that will help you with better plan (example: plan by hour), new choices and alternate options. Here is the final plan I used for my trip.
Here is my trip plan to Italy. Suggest major attractions in the below cities I will be visiting. Provide transport options for travel between cities. Recommend Italian local restaurants at each location: 1. Rome — 1.5 days 2. Amalfi Coast — 1.5 days 3. Florence — 2.5 days 4. Venice — 1.5 days
Rome is where history stands tall. Walking through the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, and Pantheon, you’re not just visiting landmarks — you’re breathing history. These sites evoke goosebumps as you imagine the lives of kings, soldiers, and citizens who once walked these grounds. If you’re planning to visit, consider skipping the line at the Colosseum (it’s worth it). A guide is optional but can really enhance the experience, bridging past and present.
Leave the history at Rome. What awaits you are Mountains on Amalfi Coast, cool Winds of Florence, Cinque Terre — Story of 5 Villages and Gondolas of Venice.
Mountains on Amalfi Coast
As you travel through Italy, you will see mountains everywhere; Mountains on land and Mountains on coast line. The Amalfi Coast felt like a slice of paradise, where mountains meet the Mediterranean. The scenery here is surreal: vibrant villages perched high on steep cliffs, overlooking turquoise waters. Our Airbnb, nestled high on one of these cliffs, offered a stunning panoramic view of the coastline. A boat and snorkeling tour along the coast was a highlight — an immersive journey into hidden caves, secluded beaches, and warm Mediterranean waters.
Winds of Florence
Florence has a charm all its own, with a magical cool breeze that welcomes you. Known for its art, culture, and incredible cuisine, it quickly became a family favorite. Florence is also an ideal base for day trips to Tuscany’s famed wine regions and charming medieval villages. The restaurants here are a treat, offering some of the best Italian cuisine we’ve ever had, which our kids loved too.
Cinque Terre — Story of 5 Villages
We chose to visit Cinque Terre, 5 villages along the beautiful coastal region. These villages stand on steep hills (it’s common across Italy) along the sea with houses colored with various colors. Villages are connected by sea, trains and trails. You can trek mountains to reach across villages. At Cinque Terre, you experience natural beauty, rich history, and Italian culture. You will see how Italians relax and enjoy life.
Gondolas of Venice
No trip to Italy is complete without visiting Venice, the “City of Love.” Surrounded by water and navigated by gondolas, Venice feels romantic in every sense. Its narrow, winding streets, centuries-old art, and serene canals create a timeless beauty that makes you feel like you’ve stepped into another era.
As the trip drew to a close, emotions ran high. Physically exhausted, we encountered an unfortunate incident when one of our bags was lost at the Rome railway station. Not a great feeling when you lose what is yours. Cops were of no help. We were grateful to have all our travel documents intact. Pickpockets are real, take warning seriously, keep an eye on your belongings!
We’d have taken more day trips from Florence and been more vigilant about pickpockets.

My family rented two Polestar 2 cars for a week long jaunt from Rome to Florence and around the Tuscan countryside, where we stayed at a beautiful villa for five nights, for a total around 1000 km. The catch was that the villa was sited for gorgeous views at the peak of a local hill on a farm that was accessed by 4–5 km of gravel road, depending on direction of approach. We obtained fast DC charging on the highway away from and back to Rome (more later), but there was no convenient fast charging near the villa.
The Polestars came with an EU wall outlet charging cable, so we were intent upon charging from outlets just inside the front and rear doors. Fortunately, the proprietors left out two grounding plug adaptors that mated with the Polestars’ cable, and we were off. Both outlets were on a single breaker, so only one car could be charged at a time, but at 2.3 kW, wall charging is faster than in the USA, and we were able to share the juice and obtain enough for extensive day trips in Tuscany. The catch was that the owners were unhappy with our solution on grounds that it violates their solar array agreement, which specifies “agricultural uses”. They did accept a nominal payment in compensation, however. We of course argued that they would benefit from offering this as a feature in their AirBnB listing.
On the highway, we charged at an Enel X charger at a shopping center, which offered only one 50 kW DC fast charging spigot with 5 slower Level 2 spigots. This was typical of most charging stations across Italy. So we had to time-share the two cars between a fast and a slow spigot, which seemed absurd coming from our experience with Tesla superchargers featuring at least 4–8 100–200 kW spigots per installation. A second session at a Evviva charging station benefitted from four fast spigots, but the initial 140 kW soon dropped to 70 kW when the second car was added.
Thankfully, the Evviva station recognized our Enel X app, but this was not at all apparent without some coaching from another EV driver who was incredibly helpful. The onboarding for Enel X charging had been quite painful, requiring download of an app, entry of quite a bit of personal information, and manual entry of credit card information. My attempt to register for an account was unsuccessful on three successive tries, but I was able to pay as guest, and the app put me in good shape for later charging on the Evviva chargers. But here’s the question:
Why is it possible to purchase fuel at most any gas station using only a credit card reader, but not at an EV charger? Who is blocking the adoption of a modern process for entering only the most rudimentary validating information (e.g. zip code), or more recently, simply tapping a card or a phone, without the frustrations of downloading apps or entering extensive personal information to set up “accounts” that are totally unnecessary?
For heaven’s sake, give me a charge and TAKE MY MONEY, already! We don’t owe you a database.

If you’re someone who daydreams about chasing la dolce vita, you should know that while many of us adore living in Italy, this country has plenty of problems. Some of these problems show signs of fixing, and others will likely take generations of cultural and behavioral changes to resolve.
Here are some particular reasons not to move to Italy, or at least reasons to keep in mind before doing so.
I once dated a kind, educated Italian man in his late 20s who seemed to say all the right things. He was vegetarian, had been to therapy, had healthy boundaries with his parents, and was a self-proclaimed feminist.
What a score! I thought to myself.
Unfortunately, he also thought it was appropriate to rank potential female hires by how hot they were. He sincerely thought that I’d enjoy hearing about how he and his male coworker — in their male-dominated Italian office, within a male-dominated industry — had added an extra column in their hiring spreadsheet to rank potential female hires as “hot”, “not hot”, or “maybe hot”.

Italy, a country located in Southern Europe, is globally renowned for its rich history, stunning landscapes, delicious cuisine, and vibrant culture. From its iconic historical landmarks to its contributions to art, fashion, and automotive design, Italy continues to capture the hearts and minds of people around the world. In this article, we will explore the various facets that contribute to Italy’s fame and allure.
Italy is often referred to as the cradle of civilization, thanks to its pivotal role in ancient history. The Roman Empire, one of the most influential empires in history, originated here and left behind a remarkable legacy of architecture, law, and governance. Landmarks like the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon stand as enduring symbols of this glorious past.
The Renaissance, a period that marked the rebirth of art, literature, and science, also originated in Italy. Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome became the epicenters of intellectual and artistic achievements. Great minds such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael produced masterpieces that are celebrated worldwide today. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence and the Vatican Museums in Rome house some of the most important works of art in existence, drawing millions of tourists every year.
Italian cuisine is another significant reason for Italy’s fame. It is internationally adored and has heavily influenced culinary traditions worldwide. Dishes such as pasta, pizza, risotto, and gelato are not just staples of Italian food but have become favorites in many countries.
Italy’s culinary scene is incredibly diverse, with each region offering unique flavors and specialties. For example, the rich and hearty dishes of Northern Italy contrast sharply with the fresh and vibrant flavors found in the South. The Sicilian cannoli and Neapolitan pizza are just two examples of Italy’s gastronomic treasures. Food festivals held throughout the country celebrate local produce, further showcasing Italy’s commitment to quality and tradition in cooking.
Italy has long been a leader in the fashion and design industry. Cities like Milan are known as fashion capitals, hosting prestigious events such as Milan Fashion Week. Renowned designers like Gucci, Prada, Versace, and Valentino have transformed the global fashion landscape with their innovative designs and luxurious collections.
In addition to fashion, Italy is home to several iconic automotive brands, including Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Maserati. The country’s passion for automotive engineering and design is evident in its sleek sports cars that symbolize speed and elegance. The annual Mille Miglia race and the Auto e Moto d’Epoca exhibition in Padua further highlight Italy’s deep-rooted love for automobiles.
Italy is blessed with diverse landscapes, from the picturesque villages of the Amalfi Coast to the rolling hills of Tuscany. The stunning scenery is a significant draw for tourists, who flock to experience the natural beauty and charm of Italian regions.
Italy has the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world, with 58 sites that showcase its cultural and natural heritage. From the ruins of Pompeii to the stunning frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, these sites attract millions of visitors every year, eager to immerse themselves in Italy’s storied past.
Italian art has left an indelible mark on the world, influencing countless artists and art movements. Baroque, Renaissance, and Neoclassicism are just a few of the notable art styles that have roots in Italy. The beautiful architecture found in cities like Venice and Rome also demonstrates the profound artistic vision of both past and contemporary architects.
Italy is known for its colorful festivals and lively celebrations that reflect its rich culture and traditions. Events such as Carnevale di Venezia and the Palio di Siena draw both locals and tourists alike, showcasing traditional costumes, music, and dance. These events not only honor Italy’s deep-rooted traditions but also offer a glimpse into the Italian way of life.
The Italian culture is characterized by warmth, hospitality, and a strong sense of community. The Italian way of life emphasizes family values, hearty meals, and leisurely activities. This welcoming nature is often what draws tourists back to Italy time and again, as visitors leave with not just memories of scenic landscapes and historic sites but also of heartfelt connections with the locals.
Some must-visit locations include Rome (the Colosseum, Vatican City), Florence (Uffizi Gallery, Duomo), Venice (St. Mark’s Basilica, Grand Canal), and Milan (Duomo di Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II).
Italian cuisine is popular for its fresh ingredients, simplicity, and variety. Dishes can be easily customized and offer a balance of flavors that appeal to a wide range of palates.
The best time to visit Italy is during the spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) when the weather is mild, and the tourist crowds are relatively smaller.
Yes, Italians value family, social interactions, and meals enjoyed together. It is common to greet friends with a kiss on both cheeks and to enjoy long meals that include multiple courses.
Italy has significantly influenced art, architecture, music, and cuisine. The country is credited with introducing opera, contributing to Renaissance art, and establishing fashion trends that continue to resonate today.
In conclusion, Italy’s fame can be attributed to its rich historical legacy, extraordinary culinary delights, vibrant fashion scene, breathtaking landscapes, and warm culture. Each facet adds to the allure that keeps people around the world enamored with this beautiful country.

Pinch me! Even now, two months after returning from my dream trip, I still can’t believe it happened. I spent almost a month in Italy, shadowing doctors across different cities while also working as a content creator with international brands. Like what?!
Europe was on my travel list for 2027 – literally a far off fantasy because duh, it’s expensive. But somehow, I got there because I dared to send an email. It all started when doctors in italy slid into my inbox, asking me to create a reel for their brand as a part of a paid collab and in the most “main character” moment of my life, I shot back an email like “Umm how about I come and experience your healthcare system first-hand rather than just talking about it from across the oceans?”
And?? To my surprise, they agreed! I was the first Indian content creator they sponsored a trip for. After a test reel that impressed them with my insights, link clicks, and resulting applications, we booked my first-ever business-class flight to Europe – from Kolkata. I couldn’t hold back my emotions. The little kid in me had a teary eye – I was the first in my entire family to apply for a Schengen Visa, the first to fly out of Asia, the first to go on a sponsored trip, and the first to break all those limiting beliefs.

The Magic of Northern Italy: My Journey From Milan to Florence,https://medium.com/@andreaswagner_68972/the-magic-of-northern-italy-my-journey-from-milan-to-florence-407caac22f7c,"Sign up

Last year I went on a month-long journey through the North of Italy. In this article, I want to share some of the highlights that I made on the tour. Additionally, I thought I’d complement my own thoughts with impressions of German writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who visited Italy from 1786 to 1788.
My journey began in Milan, which is the second largest city in Italy after Rome. My first impression of the city was a bit disappointing as I perceived it as quite dirty and ran down. Maybe this was due to the fact that my hostel was located next to the main station, which is not the best area in town.
The hostel itself, however, was very nice. I would do a lot of exploring around the center of the city. Two of the main sites are the Milan Cathedral and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The former was built in 1386, and I highly recommend taking a tour through the Cathedral, including the rooftop.
The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is Italy’s oldest active shopping gallery. It stands out due to its high ceilings, the glass dome in the center, and its luxurious shops and restaurants within the gallery. I found the architecture very fascinating, although it is obviously overrun by tourists.
After a short stay in Bergamo, I headed out to Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliett. Verona has a nice Mediterranean vibe and is home to the Verona Arena, one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheaters.
It was built in 30 AD and is still in use today. Goethe wrote about the amphitheater:
“The simplicity of the oval is palpable to every eye in the most pleasant way, and every head serves as a measure of how enormous the whole is. Now, when you see it empty, you have no measure; you do not know whether it is big or small.”
Although the amphitheater is one of the city’s main attractions, what stood out to me was the general architecture you can find throughout the city. There is a beautiful hill, home to the Castel San Pietro, from which you are able to overlook the city.
Lake Garda, which is easily reachable from Verona, was my next stop. What stood out to me was the panoramic view, with the majestical mountains of the Alps in the background. Goethe was also enraptured by this view:
“How much do I wish that my friends were with me for a moment to enjoy the prospect, which now lies before my eyes. I might have been in Verona this evening, but a magnificent natural phenomenon was in my vicinity — Lake Garda, a splendid spectacle, which I did not want to miss, and now I am nobly rewarded for taking this circuitous route.”
I stayed in a small town called Desenzano del Garda, which is a great hub for exploring the surrounding areas. Even in late October, you are able to enjoy some hours at the lake’s beaches.
My next stop on the list was Venice — a town I have seen so many times in various movies but never in person. So as soon as I left the train station and saw the canal in the beautiful sunshine, I had a big smile on my face. I stayed in a hostel called the Generator, which is located on one of the smaller side islands but offers a great view of the city.
Now, Venice really is a place of its own. You do not need to visit museums or galleries because the city itself is a piece of art. It gained wealth and power between the 9th and 12th centuries and had another very influential phase during the Renaissance. The boats, the houses, the canals. Everything in Venice feels magical, and you could easily believe that the city is a well-constructed theme park.
Note, however, that many tourists are moving through the narrow alleys of which Goethe wrote:
“After dinner, I hurried to first get an impression of the whole, and threw myself (…) into the labyrinth of the city, which, although intersected by canals and small channels, is connected again by bridges and small bridges. One cannot imagine the narrowness and crowdedness of the whole without having seen it.”
After I left Venice and spent one night in Bologna, I headed further south to Florence. Now, if you’re a fan of DaVinci, Michelangelo, or art in general, this city is a must-see! Although I was already a bit tired of the hustling and bustling of all the cities I’d seen, I managed to visit the Uffizi, which hosts one of the most important collections of the Renaissance era.
What I enjoyed even more in Florence was the community kitchen of my hostel — the Yellow Square. Every night a committed group of travelers would gather in the kitchen and share meals and stories of their day. Furthermore, the hostel has a nice rooftop terrace from where you can overlook the city.
Finally, it was time for me to head out into nature. I went to a place called LaVerna — an old, mystical monastery that is located on the top of a mountain. From there, I would start on a week-long pilgrimage along the way of St. Francis, which ultimately led me to the town of his birth, Assisi.
Thank you for reading this article. If you enjoy my writing, please follow my profile on medium. See you soon!

The morning started off with my phone having not charged during the night. Then as we rushed out of the house I realised I had forgotten it.
Fortunately just a minor inconvenience as I’d only gone a few metres before patting my pockets and realising I didn’t have it. But now the battery was low and we needed the phone for our journey. Rail tickets, buying metro tickets, plane boarding passes and Uber on arrival.
This trip was just a short 6 day visit to Italy — 3 days in Rome and 3 days in Florence. The occasion, celebrating the 80th birthday of Roger, our long time round the world travelling companion, who was coming from South Africa to Italy to celebrate his birthday with his family in Venice.
As my phone charge was low I used the time on the train from Aveiro to Porto to charge it. But as I gathered my extra jacket and luggage the phone fell on the floor.
I didn’t realise I didn’t have it until I needed it to pay for the metro tickets. Frantic patting and searching was in vain. It was on the train on the way to Spain!
After explaining my predicament to Sara at the Campanha station ticket office, she immediately contacted…

Think you know Italy? Think again.
Though I knew a fair amount about Italian culture before moving to Calabria last year, I’ve learned a few things that have surprised me now that I’m here.
In the U.S., we are used to being spoiled by friends and family for our birthdays, aren’t we?
Here, it’s the opposite. You, the birthday girl, are supposed to take out your loved ones to celebrate you. I think it’s to offset the cost of the gifts that they give you.
This year, I avoided breaking the bank by having a party at my house instead. But I almost made a faux pas by offering to split a meal the day after my birthday with my “Italian mamma” until I remembered this strange cultural norm and quickly went to pay for our lunch.
I have never been big on blowdrying my hair, but in Italy, I get raised eyebrows.
It turns out, Italians believe in what they call a colpo d’aria, literally a hit of air. It causes, or so they believe, headaches, colds, and a litany of maladies. And having wet hair invites it.

The side of Italy no one talks about: Why I Won’t Return to These 3 Italian Cities as a solo traveler.,https://medium.com/@jerryodogwu/the-side-of-italy-no-one-talks-about-why-i-wont-return-to-these-3-italian-cities-as-a-solo-c32752bc919b,"Sign up

Everyone has Italy on their travel bucket list, and for good reason. Italy has everything from beautiful landscapes to rich history. I have traveled to Italy at least once a year for the last six years. There are some cities you can’t see once, like Rome and Venice. Some others should be seen just once or avoided completely.
These are the three Italian cities I wouldn’t return to.
Italy’s third biggest city is not the most popular and for good reason. Naples is a city filled with so much history.
Dubbed the city with the most beautiful metro stations in the world. Naples has something for everyone, regardless of your interests. If you are a football enthusiast, It’s home to one of Europe’s most famous and oldest football teams. For those of us who love a bit of adventure, the south-east of Naples is home to the infamous mount Vesuvius. The glorious view of the city from the mountain’s summit is a must-see.
A twenty-minute boat ride from the center of the city will get you to the beautiful island of Capri. Another short boat ride away is the breathtaking Amalfi coast.
Before I got to Naples, I wondered why I hadn’t seen thousands of videos about it like I had for Rome, Venice and Milan. Upon arrival, it all started to make sense. For a city that had so much to offer, it had so much working against it.
According to Numbeo, Naples has one of the highest crime rates in Europe and has been that way for a long time. It’s the only city I’ve visited where military trucks camp in residential neighborhoods. The truck stationed a few meters from my Airbnb had at least 10 soldiers posted with it. I guess this was because the Santa Maria di Costantinopoli area was usually very busy, even after midnight. However, I was not quite sure if that made me feel safe or just uncomfortable.
The city has a bustling population. Be prepared for packed metro trains, along with a good number of pickpockets.
Naples is a tight knit city filled with a plethora of dark alleys and sketchy neighborhoods. Walking by some of these places late at night made me feel very uneasy. I could feel stares and the silence always made me feel like something was about to happen.
Will I visit Naples again? Yes! But, only briefly, as I’d use the city as a brief pass-way to the Amalfi coastal towns and Sorento.
This has got to be one of Italy’s least known cities. But, it’s one of those small cities that’s blessed with. a great location and history.
A small city in the southwest corner of the island of Sicily, Catania is one of those places I was happy to visit.
But I never want to visit again!
The best thing about Catania is its proximity to fascinating Italian places. An hour north from the city lies the tallest volcano in Europe, Etna. The imposing volcano can be viewed from almost all over Catania as well as the neighboring towns. Hiking up the volcano was an unforgettable experience. That one activity changed my entire perception on traveling.
2.5 hours from Catania is home to one of the most beautiful beaches in Italy, Taormina. The town is high up and boasts some breathtaking views of the sea.
Walking through the center of Catania, you will bump into many historical landmarks like Roman amphitheaters, tucked inside tiny neighborhoods. It is still an Italian city, so there’s no need to speak about the amazing food. Catania has all the pistachio you can eat and in every form imaginable.
However, the city is far from perfect!
Catania is the only Italian city with a higher crime rate index than Naples.
First thing that struck me when I arrived was how uptight and unfriendly the locals were. The only person I saw smile was my Airbnb host.
I remember almost getting hit by cars (yes, plural!) while walking on zebra crossings several times on my first day. I had a hard time getting a simple Covid test done, but I was lucky to meet some Italian-speaking Ghanaians who made things easier.
This was another city that was filled with a lot of sketchy areas. My second day in Catania, I was up at 5am to get some sweet sunrise photos. It was only a short 15 min walk from my Airbnb to a great spot by the dock, but somewhat uncomfortable.
Google’s shortest path had me walking in the dark through some questionable streets like Viale Africa with expensive camera gear. Needless to say, that was the only time I was out that early for sunrise pictures.
Yes! That Florence. The same history rich city that’s on everyone’s bucket list. Florence was my third stop on a backpacking trip across five cities in Italy a few years ago. My stay was brief but filled with unforgettable memories. Some good, some not so good.
Florence is beautiful, there’s no question about that.
I was blown away by the surreal details of the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore and the jaw dropping view of the city from Bulwark of San Giorgio.
The food, oh the food! We all know Italy is famous for its food, but dining in Florence was a whole new experience.
I could go on and on about the magnificence of Florence. But to keep this post short, I’ll dive into the reasons why I wouldn’t want to return in the future.
A bit of context, before this trip, I had already been living in Europe for a couple of years. Florence was the first experience of being tailed by security in a store. I stopped by a convenience store and the security guard stayed on my back. He didn’t return to his post until I left the store (I spent at least 30 mins shopping).
That was a new and uncomfortable experience for me, something I had only heard about on tv and vlogs.
Walking by the train station, one notable thing you would see from sunup to sundown is ”idle” people. This is common in most cities, why’s it different here? Aggression! They can come off a bit strong when asking for money.
I remember getting verbally harassed when I refused a guy’s request for money. It could have developed into a physical confrontation had I given him more attention.
To summarize, I didn’t hate my visit to any of these cities, on the contrary, I had some amazing moments there.
The purpose of this post is to help travelers be a bit more aware when they visit, especially the solo travelers.
Here are some tips that might help if you decide to visit:
Lastly, tell me your least favourite Italian city in the comments.
Cheers.

If you are a new student in Italy from another country, this story is for you! I’ve been living in Turin for about 5 years and want to share my experiences with you. If it helps even one person, I’ll be happy. 🥰
First, I give a brief introduction about myself. When I was in my own country (Iran, Tehran), I studied software engineering and working as a front-end web developer for 3 years. After a 5-year gaps, I returned to academia. 🤓📚
I moved to Italy, Turin in August 2019 and graduated in December 2022. I studied in Politecnico di Torino to get a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering with a Data Analytic specialty. I began working for one year as a business data Analyst; you can read more about my job experience here.
Before moving forward, I need to point out that these are just my personal observations and views; other people may have different experiences.
Okay, let’s have a look at the challenging parts of studying and living in Italy. 🤟🏼
Without a doubt, the most difficult aspect for me was Italian language! Yes years of studying English from bottom of my heart was nothing! 🥲 (Believe me I get used to study English as a hobby) and the fact is nearly 97% of the Italian population speaks Italian and only 13% of Italians speak English. English is a mandatory school subject in Italy, however it’s not taught very well.
The main reason my Italian hasn’t improved much, because my master’s degree was in English and I was surrounded by international students and academics, and when I started working, I noticed it was essential to know Italian language, and most of the recruiters will ask you about the level of your language and personally I lost some job opportunities just because I can’t speak Italian well. 🥲
Even if you work in a large company with foreign colleagues, don’t expect them to switch to English during the internal meetings, in coffee or lunch time; trust me, it’s hard for them and need to put more efforts. People in shops, post offices, and nearly everywhere speak Italian. 🤷🏻‍♀️
So, even if you don’t want to stay in Italy for ever, I recommend that you start learning Italian as soon as you decide to come here. 🤝 🇮🇹 Knowing the language will greatly improve your quality of life, as well as your ability to make friends and integrate. When you first try to speak Italian, Italians are quite helpful if they feel that you are making efforts. So, don’t be shy; start talking, even if you only know a few words, use them. 💪🏼
For the first year as a student on a tight budget, it was difficult for me to rent my own flat (In Italian: monolocale), So I lived in a shared house with other flatmates and roommates, but for the second and third years I had my own room in the university dormitories.
If you would like to live in a shared house, you should be prepared for the challenges that come with coexisting and living with other people. However, it might be helpful at first to not feel alone and making friendships and meet people who have a similar situation as you.
To find a house, try to check the Facebook or Telegram groups. Prices vary depending on location, proximity to universities, and city centre. Furthermore, it depends on the place where you live; for example, rent is more expensive in Milan or Rome than in Turin.
Overall, the process of finding a house takes time, so be patient and don’t be disappointed, especially at the start of the academic year, when new students will arrive, so begin searching earlier.
For the first year, I recommend having your own room in a shared house. Living with Italian flatmates can help you enhance your language skills during your free time too. 😎
If you want to preserve your state scholarship, you must pass specific credits each year, which requires dedication to studying. Most courses, aside from the exam, have a project that should be worked on during the semester, as well as a large amount of material to study DURING the semester; I emphasise DURING because if you study in Iran, you get used to studying a few days before the exam 😅 but this does not work in Italy at all 😣, and you should actively study, and you will most likely pass on the first call, but some exams you can pass or get your desired score after the second or third call. The lowest score is 18 🤌🏼, and the maximum is 30 ✌🏼.
I suggest doing other activities in your free time, such as joining a gym, going to nature, to avoid becoming overwhelmed and burnt out from only studying. 🥵
Thinking about staying in Italy in the future depends on your preferences; if you know Italian well and like good food 🍕🍝🍷(who doesn’t?! 😄) and sunny weather ☀️🌊 ⛱️, then Italy is your place 🤝 or you may prefer to stay in a country that has better facilities for immigrants (like Germany, Netherlands, Belgium or Canada or America).
Italy lacks infrastructure for immigrants; as an example in order to obtain a driver’s licence, I need to know Italian (at the B1 level) or you can get a passport after ten years! While In other countries, you can obtain earlier than this. Also consider that the base salary and expenses are lower in compare with the other countries.
I hope you enjoyed this story, please let me know your feedback or if you want to know more about living in Italy.
Have a nice day and thanks for reading! 🥰

Hello you!
If you know me, you know how much I obsess over the movie Eat Pray Love and Julia Roberts’ performance in it. Ever since I watched Julia in the movie enjoying her best life in Italy — living alone, learning Italian, eating pasta (my favorite food) and pizza, drinking lots of wine, and making lovely, warm friends — I knew I wanted that. Here’s the tweet — oh, I mean, X post — I saved up to express this goal of mine.
One of my favourite scenes from the movie is when Julia eats pasta and drinks wine in Italy. That moment, along with her performance, is pure bliss.
Today, I watched Emily in Paris, Season 4, Part 2. Spoiler alert!
I saw a similar scene where Emily and Marchello eat Italian food with the same sense of bliss, making me feel warm and smile. It reminded me how much I longed for that full Italian experience, just like Julia Roberts in Eat Pray Love.
Italy, await me. I’ll see you soon!🥂
Read about what made me smile on Day 16.

As an American expat living in the south of Italy, one thing I’ve noticed that is vastly different in Italy vs. the U.S. is the perception of time.
In the U.S., we’re always in a hurry…
…we have no time…
…we believe time is money…
…and we hate wasting time.
In Italy, we have all the time in the world. And despite the long lines you often find yourself in, you will rarely see an Italian get upset about the wait.
Today I went to the doctor for the first time. I wasn’t sick but needed a referral for other services. I entered the tiny waiting room and there were five other people already waiting for the same doctor as me.
Knowing that things often take longer than they would in the U.S., I settled in with my driving school app to pass the time taking quizzes.
One woman was pacing the waiting room, clearly frustrated about the wait, given that she obviously didn’t feel well. The other women were yammering on about how stupid it is that some people treat their dogs like their children (Italians love connecting on just about any subject!).

Italy is one of those places that one can visit time and again, and always enjoy thoroughly. That’s why we picked it as our next travel-from-home destination, and this time we shared the experience with friends, virtually over Zoom. Below is our digital kit for how you can recreate a similar visit.
To set the mood for our visit we started with Maurizio Carlini’s music and his albums Il Figlio Della Sarta and Er Futuro De ‘Sta Città. There isn’t a ton of information online about Carlini but I stumbled upon his music on Spotify and thought his mellow voice would be perfect while we made dinner.
Afterwards we proceeded with the extensive Perfect Italian Dinner playlist on Spotify whose selection of artists like Marino Marini and Carlo Buti inspired romantic visions of Italy’s bridges, vineyard hills warmed by the summer sun, and little espresso cups lingering on small round tables.
Before we started making dinner, we made a classic Negroni cocktail. The Negroni is a pretty simple cocktail, but we made a quick video of the process: add 1oz. of gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth to a glass. Add ice and stir for a minute. Optionally, express a lemon peel into the cocktail and rub the peel around the lip of the glass.
We also enjoyed a plain S. Pellegrino, Italy’s mineral water which has been produced for over 620 years. With dinner, we opened a bottle of Valle Reale Vigneto di Popoli Montepulciano d’Abruzzo. Its balanced flavor reminds us of the house wine we enjoyed so much with our meals in Italy.
We decided to make ricotta gnocchi and used this simple recipe from Gimme Some Oven, which is adapted from J. Kenji López-Alt’s recipe. It didn’t take long to make and the recipe was very easy to follow, but we made sure to purchase high-quality Ricotta di Bufala, 00 flour, and aged Parmigiano-Reggiano. After boiling the gnocchi, we tossed them in an Arrabbiata sauce, topped with fresh Mozzarella, and broiled until the cheese was bubbling and browned.
For dessert we sampled some Bodrato dark chocolate and our friends tasted classic tiramisu and Italian sorbet.
Initially I wanted to tell my friends about the Italian novelist Elena Ferrante whose Neapolitan novels I adore, but since this is her pseudonym and we don’t know much about her, I decided to go down the poetry route and learn about a contemporary Italian poet, so I found Patrizia Cavalli.
Born in Todi, Cavalli is much loved in Italy and is one of the most recognized modern Italian poets in the world today. The Booklist described her poetry collection My Poems Won’t Change the World (2013) (English translation is available) as a “must-read for fans of contemporary poetry.” Poetry Foundation discusses Cavalli’s style as conversational, focused on the simplicity of the everyday -
One thinks of Sylvia Plath, perhaps, or Anne Sexton: a poetry far from the great events, founded on the candor of individual confession and the intensification of the everyday, often stylistically stingy (conversational, paratactical, metrically lax), as in these lines by Patrizia Cavalli:
If you were to knock now on my doorand if you took your glasses offand I took off mine which are just like yoursand if you then entered into my mouthunafraid of kisses that are not alikeand said to me: “My love,what has happened?” — it would bea successful bit of theater.
— From My Very Own Singular “I”
I also think her poem [The happy ones are almost always also vulgar] is especially relevant for our hurried life, recently interrupted by Covid-19:
The happy ones are almost always also vulgar;happiness has a way of thinkingthat’s rushed and has no time to lookbut keeps on moving, compact and manic,with contempt in passing for the dying:
Get on with your life, come on, buck up!Those stilled by pain don’t mixwith the cheerful, self-assured runnersbut with those who walk at the same slow pace.
If one wheel locks and the other’s turningthe turning one doesn’t stop turningbut goes as far as it can, dragging the otherin a poor, skewed race until the carteither comes to a halt or falls apart.
One of the best parts of sharing our experience with friends is that we all reflected back on our visits to Italy, our favorite moments and impressions. We had all visited Florence so we spent some time talking about the Uffizi art gallery there. Our friend Ivan told us about how struck he was by Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Painted on canvas in the 15th century, this work of art shows Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, standing on a giant scallop shell and covering her nakedness with long, blond hair. You can zoom in on the painting on the Uffizi’s website.
Our friend Zhanina who is an architect told us about someone we should have probably already known about: Renzo Piano. Piano is a world-known Italian architect and his notable buildings include the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (with Richard Rogers, 1977), The Shard in London (2012), the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City (2015) and Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens (2016).
He is known for his clean, simple lines, and people-centric philosophy. His firm Renzo Piano Building Workshop (RPBW) seeks to achieve a sense of lightness. As its website says,
This might mean finding innovative methods to diffuse natural light over a world-class art collection, or angling a roof so a new building does not cast shadow over a city park.
Zhanina told us that Paino designed the new wing of Boston’s Isabella Gardner Museum as well as the Harvard Art Gallery. We’ve visited both of these museums often and never realized who was behind their beauty and light.
Tarantella is a traditional couple folk dance Italian dance during which the women dancers frequently carry tambourines. Britannica says that, “The tarantella’s origin is connected with tarantism, a disease or form of hysteria that appeared in Italy in the 15th to the 17th century and that was obscurely associated with the bite of the tarantula spider; victims seemingly were cured by frenzied dancing.”
While its origins sound a bit bleak, the dance is very upbeat and happy and we enjoyed mimicking the movements of these two dancers on YouTube. Especially after all of the food and drinks we had consumed, we welcomed the fun and movement this brought.
We decided to watch No Reservations | Emilia Romagna with Anthony Bourdain and it was the perfect ending of this immersive experience. We learned about the making of balsamic vinegar, Sangiovese wine, and a variety of meats and cheeses. It was so refreshing to see the craftspeople featured in the episode show such passion for and pride in their work.
Our trip to Italy was a dream, and sharing it with friends encouraged us to reflect on each component of this experience and made it richer. Hope these suggestions help you design a special trip to Italy, even if it’s just from home.

Every day, I learn something more about my new home in Calabria, Italy. I now laugh at how much I DIDN’T know before I moved to Italy. Hopefully, this post will help you gain a few more nuggets of wisdom if you’re planning to relocate to Italy!
I’ll be in the middle of a deep conversation with a friend or my boyfriend and then the phone rings. 98% of the time, they’ll answer.
While many Americans also keep their ringers on and answer or respond to texts, by far, the Italians have them beat. They will respond no matter what they’re doing. (Do not ask me to elaborate. You can use your imagination here!)
And if they’re the ones calling and if they get no answer, they’ll call again. And again. And again. Italian phone numbers don’t have voicemail, so you can let the phone ring until tomorrow if you want.
This is one frustration I haven’t gotten over. I feel like when you’re with people in person, they should be your focus, not whoever’s calling to shoot the shit.

Italy is my happy place. There are so much to love I don’t know that I can fully articulate them all. I fell in love with this magical country over a decade ago on my first trip to Florence and Rome. For me, there was something that happened when I took that first sip of Italian wine while sitting at a quintessential Italian bistro. For me, it was a sort of spiritual awakening. I didn’t feel like a tourist at all. I felt like I was finally coming home. So much so that when I took my 23 and me test a few years back I was convinced it would come back confirming what I felt in my soul. Turns out I’m only 7% Italian, but one can dream.
Fourteen years and four trips later I am more in love with Italy than I’ve ever been. Every time I leave to come home, I’m already obsessing over when I can go back. Time doesn’t stand still and we can’t ever duplicate an experience though. I’ve learned to embrace this over the years. Because of this, each of my trips to Italy have been dramatically different. So much so that my perspective and appreciation of Italy changes a little each time. I have learned a few simple things during this time that I want to share to make your journey everything it should be.
One of the most spectacular things about Italy is the landscape. You don’t want to miss a minute of it. To miss out on this part of the journey is like missing out on seeing the ocean if you visit the Oregon coast. For this reason, if you’re visiting multiple cities on your trip the only way to do this is by train. Do not; I repeat; do not waste your precious time on a bus. It is by far slower, stinkier, and you miss out on much of the countryside( I know this unfortunately by experience). The train system in Europe is very convenient. I recommend using the app Omio. You can search and purchase tickets from city to city, find the quickest and most inexpensive routes, and then store your tickets right to your I-phone or smart phone. Book a window seat so you can be sure to take in all of the amazing views. Pro tip: Pack lightly and make sure your bags are easily accessible when you disembark the train. This process can get a little bit chaotic, but still so worth it.
Everyone enjoys a summer vacation. School tours, large groups, and just about everyone in between will be in Italy in the summer. For this reason, if you can manage the timing heed my advice when I tell to you go during a non-peak season. Not only will you avoid the stifling heat, you will pay less for pretty much everything, you will get to have some leisure that doesn’t happen when you are battling the summertime crowds. You can enjoy your time in front of the David without waiting in line and then having to fight your way to front just to get a photo. Imagine standing in the middle of St. Mark’s Square in Venice, with only a handful of other tourists ( I have very fortunately experienced this). Or picture yourself standing in the Sistine Chapel without wall to wall people. This is an experience that precious few can say they’ve encountered while traveling in Italy.
While you’re taking time to get in touch with your inner Italian make sure you allow your eyes to move from the map you’re using. Close the navigation on your phone and please get lost. One of the beautiful things about being in a foreign country is allowing yourself to wander. We live in an age of maps and GPS everywhere so I realize this can be challenging. But by putting the directions away you will find that you start to see what’s right in front of you instead of planning how to get to the destination on your mental to-do list. Roaming through the streets of a walled city in Tuscany is something you won’t regret or ever forget. Allow yourself to stumble upon the unique local shops and chat with the friendly Italians. While I agree that some planning is necessary on your journey the real adventure comes when you let yourself drift and soak up the treasures just waiting for you.
Italy is truly a remarkable place. There’s an omnipresent feeling that you’re surrounded genius works of art and culture. I challenge you to visit and enjoy, but always save a little bit to explore on your next trip. I do hope that your journey allows you get in touch with a little bit of your Italian and keeps you coming back for more. You won’t regret the views from the train. You’ll not want to miss any of the Italian wine while you eat the best pasta of your life. And don’t forget to find yourself on a street that you hadn’t planned on visiting, soaking up a view that you didn’t realize was waiting for you.

I grew up in Lombardy, the richest, most populous and productive region in Italy. It is the Italian region with the most UNESCO World Heritage sites, but you have probably heard of it because of A.C. Milan, Inter Milan, Lake Garda, Italian black caviar, or Franciacorta wines.
To be more precise, I spent most of my early life in a small town where almost everyone could speak a variation of the Lombard language, even foreigners. It took me years to realize that what I just described is an extraordinary linguistic context, even for Italian standards. It was not until I turned fifteen and started dealing with students coming from other towns and cities that I truly become aware of how few people were fluent in that language.
Eventually, it turned out that I am part of the 12.2% of the Italian population who actively speaks a local language. Needless to say, this sad statistic makes it clear how endangered those local languages are. You might be wondering why this is happening. But first, let’s delve into Italy’s linguistic heritage.
As you can see in the image below, the Italian linguistic context is incredibly complex.
Tullio De Mauro, the most famous Italian linguist who ever lived, identified thirteen minor languages in Italy in addition to Italian. Then, each of them consists of dozens of local variations, bringing the number of languages spoken in Italy to a few hundred.
Most of these languages evolved locally from Vulgar Latin and are not directly related to Italian, but they are erroneously called “dialects”. Consequently, you will also hear of them as “Italian dialects”, even though they are languages and not dialects.
According to this study, only 25.2% of Italians use both their local dialect and Italian in their daily lives, while only 12.2% actively speak their local dialect. Furthermore, as discovered by ISTAT in 2006, 55.1% of Italians can only speak the Italian language. This makes those wrongly-called dialects endangered languages that will probably disappear in a few decades.
Many Italian grandparents have nostalgic memories of the days when they spoke and wrote their true language. Notice that I did not use the term “true” by accident. Keep in mind that the Italian language was imposed on all Italian citizens in 1861, when the Kingdom of Italy was founded.
So, even in the early 1900s, Italian was still a new language to many people, especially those who lived in rural or poor areas. These people never really considered Italian as their language. During those years, the disappearance of those local languages began.
Since the beginning of 1900, nothing really important has been done to stop this phenomenon. On the contrary, the Italian government seemed to have favored the death of these local languages more than once. Perhaps, because these languages represent more an encumbrance and a burden than a cultural heritage to protect. In this sense, only in the last few years has there been a change.
What is for sure is that when all the languages of Italy are gone forever, hundreds of years of Italy’s cultural, social, and human heritage will be lost. This will be a slow process where the Italian linguistic context will become less and less diversified with the unstoppable demise of all the wise Italian elders who are keeping those languages alive.
Many think that the death of these languages is an inevitable effect of globalization, especially considering how most young Italians prefer to learn English instead of their local language as a second language. On the other hand, young people usually stop studying English after graduating and consequently slowly forget it.
Also, people moving abroad for a brighter future tend to forget their native language or abandon it to better integrate into the new culture. Something similar happened in the past when poor families moved to the cities to find fortune. In this case, the “dialects” represented a social barrier because rich families only spoke Italian. So, the newly arrived poor people were pressured to hide their local accent and suppress their language to avoid discrimination.
According to the UNESCO’s Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, there are 31 languages classified as endangered in Italy. Each of them has a different level of endangerment, from safe to extinct.
You can get an idea of the adoption of these languages as principal languages by households living in Italy thanks to the following map produced by ISTAT in 2015:
As you can see, there is not much hope for these endangered languages, especially in northeastern and central-northern Italy. As a language learner and someone who is able to speak a local language and who uses it on a daily basis, it is really a shame and a disappointment to see the disappearance of this incredible linguistic heritage.
Here we looked at how diversified and vast the linguistic context in Italy really is. In detail, there are more than 30 endangered languages that might disappear soon, and understanding the reason why this is happening is what drove me to write this article.
Thanks for reading! I hope that you found my story helpful. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments, or suggestions.

Italy has to be on everyone’s travel shortlist — and, for a long time, it was on mine as well. It’s a destination like Paris or London or Tokyo that fills people with wonder and has an iconic feeling thanks to Hollywood and everyone’s brag-worthy Insta shots.
I can’t say why we hadn’t made it to Italy yet. We’ve been working our way through Europe country-by-country, mainly as add-ons to my work trips. There are other places I’ve gravitated towards first because they have been a bit higher on my list. We also took a massive three-week trip in 2013, and while we went to Portugal and Spain, Italy didn’t make the cut.
But I happened to have a work trip to Zurich for The Company in December, and since we did Denmark and Sweden the following year in November and froze to death, we decided to go south this trip and finally check Italy off of the list.
Italy was disappointing.
That’s not a popular sentiment. I’m dear friends with many Italophiles, and I love them and trust their opinions, but I’ve since learned that I don’t have to love all destinations equally. And Italy just isn’t my jam.
I tried to break this down into broader categories, and I realized that there are a few things that I look for when I travel:
Order: If we think about a continuum from order to chaos, I’m a lover of order. I find that chaotic places can be somewhat anxiety-triggering, but beyond that I find a smoother travel experience when it’s easy to get from A to B and when people know how to queue in lines in an orderly fashion. Even if it’s not the structure that I know, I’m happy to stand back and observe the rules and adapt to them.
Politeness: A close cousin to order is the politeness of the people in individual interactions. Are people open and kind? Do they hold doors, try to stay quieter at night, or stand up to give seats on transit for expectant mothers? When you treat someone with respect, do they respond in kind?
Warmth: How welcome do you feel, even if you are different? Do people welcome you into their lives and their families? One country that feels incredibly warm to me is Mexico — just pull up a chair and join the family! You are welcome no matter who you are and feel that people genuinely care about you.
History/Culture/Stuff to Do: This is actually the easiest requirement of all because I find so many things interesting! I can find something interesting in almost any place.
[Note: One huge exception here is camping. I don’t camp. I hate it and I refuse to spend my vacation doing something I can’t stand. So if camping is the attraction, or the accommodation, I’m out.]
So when I step back and think about my favorite trips I’ve ever taken, it’s not surprising that they would score highly across the board. If I were to rate my favorites, the top three thus far are Australia, Austria, and Hawai’i. Each of these is quite different, with different things that attract me, and each has their own detractions (scary creatures, weather, humidity, excess sand, etc.), but they are places that have a good orderliness, polite and warm people, and interesting cultural sites and activities.
The big attraction to Italy was the culture and the history. It’s the freakin’ Roman empire — how amazing to visit a society that was such a powerhouse for a thousand years! So when I think about the highlights of our visit to Rome and Florence, these cultural attractions made the biggest impression on us.
But Italy did not score so well in the categories of order, politeness, and warmth. Whenever I mention this to an Italophile they express one of two things. First, they might express regret that I didn’t experience the Italy that they love (one dear friend said, “Well, by the fifth or sixth time Italy is amazing!” which made me laugh that I’d have to do four more trips like this to discover the charm of the place). And I can see that this could be true because there were pockets of warmth. There was the amazing B&B host in Florence who gave us a mini walking tour around the B&B and kept adding recommendations to our map (to the point that I kept feeling bad that he was taking up so much time). We had some very kind servers at some of the restaurants in Rome, especially those we visited in the Jewish quarter.
But this was not a country filled with politeness or order. It felt a lot like Portugal — a city that was once great but that was, quite literally, in decay. I found the Italians en masse to be loud, pushy (literally) and rude. Sometimes their aggression is well-served — say, in the way that they drive — but in other cases it just seemed misplaced.
I have some empathy for what Romans must experience, living in a city that every idiot tourist in the world wants to visit. They tromp off of their air-conditioned coaches in khaki shorts and big white tennis shoes, stopping in the center of the sidewalk to unfurl their maps or position their selfie sticks. I get it. These are the same idiots that show up in Seattle in June, July, and August.
What frustrates the crap out of me is that we work very, very hard to not be that kind of tourist. I’ve found that learning some of the local language can be incredibly helpful. I’ll never forget my first trip to France with some friends. One of them refused to say “Bonjour” when we entered shops, instead saying “HI!” in a super-American accent. Greetings are one of the simplest ways to show respect of other cultures — it doesn’t take more than 30 minutes to learn five basic phrases in a language, and now that we have the Internet, there’s no excuse!
When it came to Italian, I spent two months learning a bit more than the basics on DuoLingo. Yes, it did help a little, but in most cases it helps grease the skids for moments of connection. Not in Italy. Not at all.
Two other simple adjustments we make when we travel is in the way that we dress and the way that we behave in public. If you’ve ever been on a train in Germany or a flight in Sweden you’ll notice how quietly people converse, mindful of the shared spaces that they are in. These are places where one doesn’t need to draw attention to oneself through behavior or dress. Dressing for the road is actually rather simple — we wear clothing that is classic and plain, or in muted patterns (like stripes, small checks, or small florals). We ditch the clothes with words and jokes and logos to go for the pan-European look. Because of how we look physically people are often unsure where we’re from (no one ever guesses Mexico for Sergio!), and because of this we can “pass” for different nationalities. The best compliment to me when traveling in Europe is for someone to think I am Swiss or German (but I’ll take Canadian!), and I take a lot of joy when I say that I am American — just one who is considerate in other countries!
All of this amounted to nothing in Italy. No amount of blending behavior worked at all. Maybe that’s because we weren’t blending with the culture? But even if you can’t blend, I had hoped there would be some appreciation that we weren’t obnoxious.
In the end, I think my experience of traveling in Italy was very much like my travels to New York City. It’s not popular to say this, but I’m not a fan of NYC. Sure — there are lots of things to do and see. I love the museums and the shows and the food. But it entirely lacks in charm and warmth, not to mention trees (I’ll give Rome this — they do have some trees here and there).
One last note, and that’s food. Food might be the fifth category, if there is one. My opinion on food has changed since I’ve modified my diet (no dairy plus I follow a modified version of the FODMAP diet) — I’m interested in the local cuisine, but in some countries the choice foods aren’t something I can eat. Italy is a great example — most pizza and pasta is covered in cheese, a big no-no for me.
I admit that we sinned big one night and had lasagna, which was delicious and worth the stomachache. Italian food was good, but since it’s widely available, there wasn’t much about it that felt so special that I could only get it there. This is different than some other cuisines where it is very difficult to get authentic cuisine outside of the place. Have you ever had amazing barramundi in the US? What about perfect shave ice outside of Hawai’i? Or flødeboller outside of Scandinavia? Or perfect spaetzle and strudel outside of Bavaria?
So that’s that. Italy turned out to be a bit of a bomb for me. We don’t have any upcoming work trips planned to Europe, but we do have a big trip planned in the spring! For something completely different, we’re going to Norway, Estonia, and Finland! To say that I’m excited is an understatement. A fair bit of my heritage is Norwegian (with a bit of Swedish and Finnish thrown in for luck), so I’m excited to visit Norway in particular. We’ve also visited both Denmark and Sweden, and while the Scandinavians aren’t the warmest people when you first meet them, those countries score off-the-charts on order, politeness, and history! I’m going to start learning basic Norwegian phrases next month!
Ciao for now, Sarah

Oh, Italy. Your vast landscapes, rich history and culture, gorgeous architecture and inexpensive cappuccinos, how I love thee. Before taking a week long roadtrip through Italy, I had expected nothing but bliss. While there was definitely bliss, there were quite a few roadblocks (like, literally.) Now that I know the quirks of traveling in Italy, my next trip there will probably look completely different, and I want to make sure that you’re set up for success for your own trip! From start to finish, here’s everything you need to know about traveling in Italy from Milan to the Amalfi Coast.
Where to Stay
When asking what most millennial’s would want from a travel guide, most of my Instagram followers said, “budgeting tips!” Obviously, where to stay takes up a significant portion of your traveling budget. That being said, I definitely suggest booking Airbnb’s on your trip in Italy if you are looking for a cost-effective experience. Here are some ways to make the most out of your #AirbnbExperience.
Not all Airbnb’s are created equal: Something I didn’t know is the difficulty of finding and entering Italian Airbnb’s. I’m sure there are areas in Italy where newer apartments/homes are available, however, NOT SO with where we stayed. Keep in mind that the buildings in Italy are, well, ancient. It is rare to find an elevator in apartment/condo buildings, and even if you do, it might be the kind that you have to manually open and close the doors of and still hike up a floor (yes, this happened.)
Prepare to sweat: If running AC is a dealbreaker for you in the summer (like it is for most people), make sure to select “Air conditioning” in Airbnb’s search options. If you don’t, you might end up trying to decide whether it’s a good idea to sleep naked with all the windows wide open all night. In the winter, this wouldn’t pose as much of an issue, since it is quite nice in the evening, but if you opt for a non-AC equipped unit in the summer just to save a few bucks, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Your host WILL meet with you and it MIGHT be awkward: A funny detail about Italy is that most Airbnb’s are run like hotels. Families own entire floors of old apartments and rent them out. That being said, check-in won’t be done solo. Unlike America, where your host will typically hide the key, wish you goodluck and not speak to you until they leave you a *fingers-crossed* kind review, Italians greet you at the street corner, will carry your bags, walk with you to the apartment, then sit with you in the living room giving you local tips. At first, this made me uncomfortable. After realizing how absolutely crucial it is to travel with a local’s tips, I looked forward to each check-in process. Don’t hurry them out, listen to every last word like it’s your religion.
Travel tax is often not included in the cost: Prepare to pay between €1–2 per person per night* at each place you stay. It’s often not included in the Airbnb cost so have euros readily available at every location. Also, prepare for your host to snap a photo of your ID or Passport. This alarmed me at first, but it is actually Italian law to report your guests to the government with their valid ID. Who knew?
*This cost maxes out after three days in one location. If you hop around Italy every few days staying in different locations, it will renew and you’ll need to pay the tax at each location.
Transportation
My favorite flight tracking site is SkyScanner, second favorite is the app Hopper. Watch flight costs and book when it’s low, then plan to travel in Italy one of two ways: public transportation or rent a car.
Car rental: If you’re absorbing the cost of more than one person (like, if you’re married, OR have the option to split travel costs with friends) it’s cheaper overall to rent a car. Tolls were around €200, the rental itself was €700, and we chose a diesel car so that every tank of gas would take us farther. We were crossing a country border, so it’d cost around that just to get to one location in Italy for both of us. However! I do not suggest driving in Italy. You might save overall, but the time wasted trying to find parking, (and in some places, paying for parking) is not easy. If you rent a car in Italy, each driver will require an Italian driver’s permit. You can acquire one at your local AAA office in the US for $20. (To my knowledge, you can not acquire one once you are overseas.)
Trains, trams, and busses: Get to Italy by plane and there will be a train station either underneath or within walking distance of any airport. Get a pass that covers the duration of your stay and you’re set. Trams and busses are optional depending on location, so I wouldn’t plan ahead for these. Depending on how many locations you visit, this is probably the best option for you. I can’t guarantee what your overall cost would be, but if you’re a solo traveler it’s most definitely the way to go.
How to Pack Light
The easiest way to pack light is by following the capsule wardrobe rules. My favorite capsule wardrobe concept is the 10x10 wardrobe created by Lee Vosberg of the Style Bee Blog. Here are the rules: pick any 10 items (not including accessories or jewelry) from your current closet and style those items into 10 different looks. Easy! The basic formula is choosing 4 tops, 2 bottoms, 1 dress, 2 shoes, 1 top layer. Pay attention to the local weather (duh) when packing, and look for inspiration by searching the #10x10Friends hashtag on Instagram!
After the fun things are packed, don’t forget the boring yet completely necessary things. If your luggage is full, purchase a space saver bag to secure your clothing in—it really will save you tons of space inside your luggage!
Budgeting
Budgeting for travel begins way before you book the flight or get on the plane.
My overall rule for budgeting is based on the rules of minimalism. I spend on experiences, not things. I don’t buy what I don’t need, and I think about purchases long and hard before taking the plunge. If traveling is a desire or a goal for you, sacrifice has to come from somewhere. Think of the person you see online constantly traveling. Unless they’re a total baller or just racking up credit card debt, the money being spent has been saved for that moment. They’re sacrificing in one area so that they can experience life more fully in another. So, stash your cash monthly toward a traveling fund rather than letting it slowly drain from your bank account simply because it’s there and available.
Additionally, don’t overspend on your zero-transaction fee credit cards (I’m really pushing for these) while you’re abroad. Stay in line with your routine budget**. It’s easy to get carried away, but painful once all those swipes reveal themselves on your monthly statement.
Overall, I can’t tell you what to or not to buy. That’s ultimately up to you. But I can advise you to evaluate your “must have/see/do’s” and ditch the things that don’t actually interest you. If it’s not your thing, don’t go to a museum because everyone tells you to, don’t rent a beach chair because I tell you to, don’t wait in line or take a tour of a monument that everyone posts on Instagram but you could care less about. See the places you want to see with your own eyes, not the eyes of your friends, family, coworkers, etc. Clearly define your traveling desires before lift-off and your life on-the-road will be easier.
**If you don’t have a routine budget, I highly suggest starting here!
Now, to the fun part! Find Airbnb, restaurant, and budgeting suggestions below for each location we visited in Italy!
MONTEROSSO AL MARE (Cinque Terre)
Where to Stay: I highly suggest staying in this Airbnb. This is one of the locations that is run like an actual bed and breakfast and is literally steps from the ocean and “new town” center.
Where to Eat: You won’t need to search very far for delicious eats. Down the main street of old and new town, you’ll pass at least thirty shops offering two cappuccinos and croissants for no more than €6. Eat at these spots during the day and save the ones below for your evening dining!
€: Fornaio Di Monterosso
€€: Bar Davi
€€€: Torre Aurora, L’Ancora della Tortuga
What to Wear: After one hour in the sun you will shed all your clothing and end up in the ocean. Wear your swimsuit, throw on shorts and a tank and call it a day. In the evening, wear something light and comfortable for dinner. You’ll see people dressed up for dinner, so if you plan to bring an outfit that makes you feel fancy when sipping on your cocktail of choice.
Local Tips: This is truly a hang out at the beach all day, shop at the mini-markets and eat your weight in seafood kind of place. The way to really enjoy it is by getting up early and snagging an umbrella by the shore while you can. The cheapest spot is right outside the Beach Bar Stella Marina. (It costs €30 for two chairs and an umbrella for the entire day.) You can purchase the spot and it’s yours until after the sun sets! Leave your towels and wander around when it’s too hot to tan, grab a bite to eat, grab some souvenirs, then come back and take a nap in the shade. If you plan to be there for a few days, get a train ticket (the train stops literally right smack by the ocean in the center of “new town”) for the duration of your stay so that you can hop around to the other four towns in the Cinque Terre, because Monterosso is only one of five!
Budgeting: The nice thing about Monerosso al Mare is that you can count on spending around €50 per day, umbrella included (if you’re not counting the Airbnb cost.) Street food is delicious and ridiculously inexpensive. Get your fill on €1 cappuccinos, croisants and gelato, then treat yoself at dinner. Budget a little extra for shopping and alcohol and you’re good to go. Side note: You can get a bottle of wine at dinner for only $18, soooo, yeah, you’re gonna wanna get that.
ROME
Where to Stay: This Airbnb was gorgeous but difficult to enter and the AC wasn’t fantastic. But it was right smack in between Vatican City and the Colosseum, so we didn’t have to spend money on transportation. If you’re able-bodied (keep in mind that you must climb a flight of stairs after taking a manual elevator) and don’t mind waiting for the air to cool down, book this Airbnb for its charm and location. If not, find one with AC and easy entry in the surrounding area.
Where to Eat: We were only in Rome for one day, but each of these spots were to die for. These are a MUST when in Rome.
€: Da Simo Pane e Vino, Pergamino Caffè, and best gelato in Rome, Della Palma!
€€: II Corallo
What to Wear: Rome is hot in the summer. Like, real hot. The locals are extremely fashionable, but they’re also adjusted to the heat, so, not sure where I land on this one. Use your own discretion. I do suggest comfortable sneakers, though, since you’ll be on foot all day.
Local Tips: Assuming you’re visiting Rome to see Vatican City, The Colosseum, etc. prepare to spend a half day or more at each location. Drink lots of water and prepare to pay to use any public restroom! Have euros on hand, always!
Budgeting: This location is hard to indicate a set budget for because everyone’s preferences are different. But things you can keep in mind: most everything to see has a fee, coffee and pastries are cheap as they are everywhere in Italy, a fine lunch/dinner can cost anywhere from €8–30 per person, and bottles of wine at dinner are CHEAP.
AMALFI COAST
Where to Stay: Our Airbnb was an absolute dream. We were a short bus ride away from central Amalfi and just down the road from a cafe, beach, and a few restaurants. This specific location is on the side of a cliff. Dreamy, but takes a quick downward hike to get to since there aren’t elevators on the sides of mountains.
Where to Eat: Surprisingly, we only ate two meals in Amalfi. One dinner, and one “breakfast”, which was actually just a croissant and a cappuccino (the only way to do breakfast in Italy!) The restaurant is, shockingly, not on maps and I can’t even remember the name. However, if you walk around in the city-center long enough, you’ll find a spot. This is the type of place to leisurely walk around and land upon a spot that captures your attention!
What to Wear: I was genuinely surprised to realize that this is not as much of a “beach town” as I’d expected. This is more of a luxurious, million-dollar-making, yacht-owning, white-elitist’s playground than a beach bum’s paradise. If you want to keep up, dress up. If not, don’t. I personally walked around in a swimsuit and shorts all day with my hair in a bun and my face red hot from the sun. But that’s just me.
Budgeting: Ironically, this specific city isn’t overwhelmingly expensive unless you’re staying in one of the high-end resorts. The food is cheap, the beach is free, you can get a few inexpensive bus tickets to take you to local cities like Praiano, Positano and Naples. However, if you’re not hopping from town to town and you’re not the stay-in-our-Airbnb-all-day type, you might run out of things to do. The city-center is beautiful to walk through, but isn’t very large, so keep that in mind when choosing to visit this city or not.
CAPRI
Where to Stay: We stayed in Amalfi—we took the ferry to Capri early one morning and returned later that afternoon.
Where to Eat: We only ate one meal in Capri, and it wasn’t great, so I won’t mention its location. However, try to find a restaurant off the beaten path because it will be less touristy, better priced and much more delicious. One that was suggested to us by our boat tour skipper was La Canzone Del Mare!
What to Wear: Pretty much everyone is in their swimsuits with a cover-up since the only things to do here are go swimming, boating, tan, drink, and eat. P.S. the sun is HOT so make sure to pack an eco-friendly, organic sunscreen.
Budgeting: Ferries to and from Capri will cost you €40 per person, a tour to the Blue Grotto varies between €15–35, a private boat tour will cost you around €180, and the food is between €12–30 per plate. You’re looking at a wild day of spending but a mind-blowing array of beauty, so, soak it up!
FLORENCE
Where to Stay: I am not joking when I say that the Duomo is in full sight from this Airbnb. It is steps from the city-center and is equal distance from all the areas you will want to visit.
Where to Eat:
Breakfast/Brunch: Le Vespe Cafe is a zero-waste cafe located in Florence! This place really made my whole day. Their cappuccinos are amazing, too!
Dinner: Osteria dei Centopoveri is a Tuscan restaurant and pizzeria, so any budget will work here! Their pizza and calzones are huge and delicious, so you’ll definitely want to visit more than once! Make sure to order a bottle of local wine—you can score an entire bottle of Tuscan wine for only €15 and they’ll cork it for you to take home if you don’t finish it!
Gelato: If you don’t get gelato from Grom, were you even in Florence? It’s literally rated the best gelato in Florence, so, don’t miss out. (The best two-scoop mix is chocolate and grom flavor!)
Cocktails: Jazz Club Firenze is one of the top rated spots for drinks and vibes in Florence. Unfortunately, they were closed for holiday when we visited, but if you are in Florence when they are open, you’ve gotta stop by and tell us how it is!
What to Wear: Florence in the summer is quite warm! This is becoming an Italian trend, eh? If you’re exposing skin (which I recommend, because seriously, it’s HOT) lather up in sun-screen. From there, you can pretty much wear anything. Florence is a stylish city but what’s important is being comfortable, since you’ll be on foot all day.
Budgeting: Everything historic has a fee, including the Medici gardens. Unless you’re ready for a hot hike around the garden, skip it and climb to the top of the Duomo, see the Medici Villas, and visit the museums, instead. You’re looking at spending between €50-€100 per person for a day or two of historic venturing. Other inexpensive restuarants are around every corner, you just have to look for them!
MILAN
We were only in Milan for lunch since we passed through it on the way back to Switzerland, but our one suggestion is a good one.
Where to Eat: Do not leave Milan without visiting Lùbar! This is closer to the €€€ scale, since the plates are small, made to share, and they recommend ordering four or more per person. But, wow, the food and drinks are jaw-dropping good.
Okay, guys. That’s it! Did I miss anything? Is there anything you have questions about that you’d like more info on? Let’s chat! Shoot me a DM on Instagram at any time and let’s plan your next adventure!

So what happens when you land up in the capital of a country, which would have welcomed you with open arms had you not uttered those deadly words right at the onset: “Sorry, I don’t speak Italian!”Well, you will definitely be frowned at, ignored, unanswered or just be left on your own - which I am sure nobody would prefer in a vibrant space such as Italy.You can make sure to begin your conversation with at least “Scusi” (Excuse Me— formal) or with a minimal salutation like “Buongiorno” or “Buonasera”. Then, perhaps, you could proceed to tone down your actual question in English by using cue words in Italian, like “toilette” (Italians prefer the french word to their own “bagno” in reference to the washroom) “piazza” or “pizzeria” “ristorante”, so that the local Italian understands quickly what you are referring to.Don’t be afraid to use Italinglish: “scusi, where is “ristorante”?” or something even shorter: “Scusi, toilette?” which will be taken more into consideration than your English version.
Italians like being elaborate when they give directions, as for everything else in life. Be patient and say “Scusi, non parlo italiano!” (Sorry, but i don’t speak Italian!) which is a table turner. This will immediately make an average Italian rush to your help even if their English is not so good. You must not, however, ever point out to an Italian that their English is not up to the mark! Praise them if you must, criticize them never. And you never know, this might be a great start to a cross-border friendship.You see, Italians take an instant liking to you if you express any sort of interest in their culture and language; they are extremely protective, just like any culture where multiple languages and dialects are spoken, about their native tongue. You’d be surprised to know that some of their dialects are full fledged languages in themselves, and equally diverse are their traditions which vary greatly from north to south.
Having learnt and then having taught the language to Indians – I have had the possibility of meeting many Italians. And I have always felt they might have, a soft spot for India and Indians in general – because in a way they are as multi-hued as us and they relate to our cultural diversity. So for them an Indian with even a basic knowledge of their language comes across as someone very “figo” (an informal slang for “cool”)!
But that is true for anyone who lands in Italy with a basic knowledge of Italian – you’ll be befriended at the bar, at the ristorante, in the tassi, in the underground metropolitana, the autobus faster than you can imagine. Don’t be overwhelmed, and don’t shy away from engaging with each one as you go. The more you chat, the more you will enjoy this land of wonders.
One last advice: If you really want to enjoy your first, and many more trips to this architecturally and scenically beautiful space – you better have your hellos, thank yous and wows in order (“Ciao” “Grazie” and “Che Bello!”)!So with the first cultural contact established, hope you have a Buon Viaggio in Italia!

So far, I’ve been to 43 major cities, 28 states, 9 countries, and I have no intention of stopping any time soon. Until the Grim Reaper pays me a visit, I’m going to travel as far as I can while I can.
Even if Mr. Reaper knocks at my door, I may tell him to “Piss off and come back later. My next trip is booked.” 🖕 #redheadattitude
I’ve had great memories at most of my destinations, but which one was the best?
Hands down, the Amalfi Coast.
Located on the western shores of Italy, this was a mother-daughter trip scheduled in 2020 and then canceled due to COVID concerns. That same year, my father passed away, my gallbladder ruptured, and my husband had a heart attack. Needless to say, 2020 was not my best year.

FOR weeks, a question had been nagging at my mind. What gives Italians their enormous self-belief while the rest of Europe is a festering mess of anxieties, neuroses and self-doubt?
It was not until just days before I was due to fly back to Australia after three-and-a-half weeks in Italy, while walking up the long driveway to our villa in Tuscany late one afternoon, that I finally understood what makes the country tick.
A month before we arrived, Italy’s leaders had been grappling to resolve one of the frequent political crises which have been a common thread in the nation’s postwar history.
And for most of our stay, the other giants of Europe — Germany, France, England, Spain, Russia — along with a host of minnows chased sport’s ultimate prize, the FIFA World Cup, while the Italians watched from afar, having failed to qualify.
Both events would be a severe test of a nation’s self-confidence, but the Italians seemed to take them in their stride.
These are testing times for Europeans, with a rise in xenophobic nationalism and risks of a splintering if the postwar consensus which has provided security and economic stability since the late-1940s.
Italy is no different, but its natives’ confidence and identity are unshakeable.
The most recent political crisis came after the March elections which resulted in a hung parliament which was only resolved on 1 June with the formation of a coalition between Matteo Salvini’s right-wing League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement led by Luigi Di Maio.
There were moments of farce in the lead up to the government being formed after president Sergio Mattarella rejected the coalition’s choice of Eurosceptic finance minister, and in turn its nominated prime minister Giuseppe Conte and instead directed Carlo Cottarelli to form a new government.
Five days later, on 1 June, after intense negotiations, Cotarelli, withdrew and the original choice, Conte, became prime minister.
Italian politics as usual, sniggered the rest of the world. But with their unshakeable self-belief, the Italians just shrugged their shoulders.
After all, just look at Britain, where the government is being torn apart by the hard and soft Brexit factions and the prime minister is looking more and more like a gormless puppet with each passing day; and the US, fast becoming a global pariah under the monstrous Trump. Or Australia, for that matter, where replacing a prime minister in the middle of their term in office has become a national blood sport.
It is the same with football. Once the shock had passed, Italians found another country or another player to root for, and the World Cup telecasts were the highest rating on record. They know the Azzuri will be back in the big league soon, and in the meantime they can point to the four stars on their national shirts, three more than the English, the last won just a dozen years ago. And didn’t the world’s best player, Cristiano Ronaldo, choose Juventus in the Italian Serie A for the next stage of his career?
Italians literally do not give a shit that you might think that their politics is a bit of a joke, that its byzantine bureaucracy is slow and frustrating, that their economy is riddled with nepotism and corruption, that the crumbling infrastructure is sometimes not much better than the third world, or that their cities are full of pollution caused by all those Vespas buzzing around and could do with a clean up.
Spend a few weeks in Italy, and you being to understand where this immense well of self-confidence, almost swagger, comes from.
It starts with their country’s gorgeous natural and built environment. Italians live on a peninsula of extremes: tiny villages perched on the edge of cliffs that plunge straight into crystal clear blue seas; exquisitely preserved centres of renaissance power; and modern cities where 2000-year-old Roman ruins are just part of the everyday backdrop. A country that can offer us both Venice and Naples, Cinque Terre and San Gimignano.
Indeed, there are days when you find yourself thinking that Italy is too good for the Italians. Do they care? Of course not — they get to live there all the time, while we are just passing through as envious tourists.
It’s the confidence that comes from knowing that your ancestors were conquering most of the known world and devising modern systems of politics, language and culture when others were still trying to work out how to invent the wheel.
And a millennium later, when others were still stuck in the dark ages, your ancestors were at it again, leading the European renaissance and leaving a legacy in art, architecture, commerce and literature that has yet to be surpassed.
It’s the confidence that comes from knowing that your ancient language forms the basis of how hundreds of millions of people speak today. It’s the confidence from knowing that your food, your clothes, the way you carry yourself, has spread to and is imitated in every corner of the world.
Is there any other culture — apart from Chinese — which has so successfully achieved global ubiquity as Italian culture, yet at the same time resisted homogenisation?
Every time we eat a slice of pizza, drink a cappuccino, slip into a Versace or Armani item of clothing, worship at a Catholic Church, or watch a television drama about the Mafia, we are unconsciously paying homage to Italy (for good or ill).
Perhaps Italy’s greatest export has been its people; it was the Italian disapora who were the foot soldiers of the peaceful cultural invasion that assures Italy of its place in the world, even as their mother country’s economic, political and military clout falls down the ladder.
And back in Italy, it is this knowledge that they have been the world’s greatest cultural colonisers that gives Italians their self-confidence.
While Italy’s other great European rivals — France, Germany and Britain — engage in public handwringing bouts of self-doubt and identity crises, the Italians maintain this solid belief in themselves.
Of course, Italy shed any serious empire-building ambitions long ago, about the time the barbarians set fire to ancient Rome. So unlike France or England, it never embarked on colonialism in the 18th or 19th centuries. Modern Britain and modern France have undoubtedly benefited from the cultural influences brought by migrants from their former colonial outposts — can you imagine London without the Indian or Jamaican communities, or Paris without its Algerian and Moroccan communities?
But it’s also undeniable that multiculturalism has brought its own tensions which have been exploited by the xenophobic right throughout Europe, but especially in Britain and France.
Italy, by contrast, still remains a much more monocultural nation, yet the recent election which brought the far right Salvini into government as Interior Minister has also brought a more sinister racist tone to Italian politics.
But it remains that if Italians suffer any anxiety about their national identity, it stems more from the centuries of rivalry between the sophisticated north and the sensual south. Remember that until less than 200 years ago, Italy was not a single nation, but a patchwork of small kingdoms and principalities, and uniting them remains an ongoing project.
My maternal grandparents came to Australia from the northern province of Friuli in the 1920s, but despite visiting Italy three previous times before this year, I have always had an ambivlence about my ancestry.
After this most recent visit, I still can’t say I feel Italian, nor has Italy become my favourite European destination. But at least I understand now what it is to be Italian.
*A note about the photograph at the top of this story: This photo was taken late in the afternoon at the corner of Via del Corso and Via Laurina in Rome, near the Piazza del Popolo. I spent a long period waiting for the right image to appear in my camera’s viewfinder and couldn’t believe my luck when this woman floated into the light. It was only later, on my computer, that I noticed that the man in the red shirt had wandered into frame at the exact moment I clicked the shutter. At first, I thought he’d ruined the photo, but on reflection, his plainness only enhances the ethereal beauty of the woman in the light, who looks as if she’s been transplanted from a Renaissance masterpiece.

When I embarked on my Italian wine journey nearly three years ago, I could have never imagined having to face a worldwide health crisis here in Italy, or anywhere, for that matter.
Rather than recount grave tales of the current quarantine situation, I wanted to share what I’ve only now realized my fellow Italian citizens have taught me.
It’s been said a million times before, but now, more than ever, we need to remember that we cannot predict or control every aspect of our lives. As an American, this is something I’ve found very hard to accept. Living amongst a population of people who contrastingly seem to embrace unpredictability, has shed a spotlight on my inability to do so.
From my first days working on a beautiful vineyard in central Italy, I wanted to know exactly what I’d be doing when. I’d inquire about lunchtime, dinner time, and my future tasks for the upcoming week, often met by quizzical and unspecific replies. “We’ll pause for lunch when we’re done with these rows”, pointing to an undefined plot of vines, or “when we pick enough Trebbiano for today,” the winemaker would tell me.
Gone were the days of living confined to my office calendar, handcuffed to the rigid meetings, scheduled a month or more in advance. Countless more examples in the Italian countryside, as well as in my current city of Bologna, reinforce that Italians innately embrace the present, instead of wasting time obsessing about the future.
This take-things-as-they-come mindset has proven very beneficial in combating hysteria and fear during these now uncertain times of Coronavirus. Italy and the majority of its people are not overly panicking about tomorrow or being frightened by media reports from abroad.
Despite exaggerated accounts, Italians are not hoarding groceries and fighting in stores, as I’ve witnessed with every prediction of 6 inches of snow in the U.S. They focus their energy on dealing with the day at hand, taking time to prepare for the next, but never forgetting to find a few minutes to laugh and be grateful to be alive.
Unless of course, we’re talking about a football (soccer) match, Italians have shown me that life is much more than a series of back-to-back competitions. In America, we are groomed for competition from birth — just look at the insanity surrounding pre-school admissions. Parents in many parts of the US are forced to apply for pre-school the moment their child is born, in fear of being left out in the cold once their child approaches school-age — 3 years later.
From elementary school through high school, the competition only increases with each passing year. Immense pressure is put on students to outperform one another, gain entry to the highest classes, most prestigious clubs, teams, and of course colleges. Pre-SATs, SATs, state proficiency exams, and class-rankings pit every student against each other, creating tremendous anxiety and comparisons amongst impressionable teenagers.
In the US, very rarely are students encouraged, or afforded the time, to help one another succeed. Instead, they are told to focus on grades, activities, transcripts and overall peer-group standing. Fierce competition for the few coveted spots at elite and popular universities drives an inordinate amount of stress and do-whatever-it-takes approach. Parents and students resort to insane, sometimes illegal, measures to gain advantages and excel above the next student. Only now, are people finally being held accountable for admissions cheating scandals.
This cut-throat competition and dog-eat-dog mentality does not permeate society in Italy or most parts of Western Europe. Many factors contribute to this of course, but one major reason is that most European universities are public and accessible to all citizens, for free, or very little money. It’s been truly eye-opening to see how much this one difference can affect a nation’s culture and mindset of its society.
In Italy, children and teenagers can grow up without the looming fear of college admissions hanging above their heads. I’d argue, this results in Italians being less individualistic and hostile towards one another, from an early age. Family values are emphasized instead of GPAs, and more time is spent cultivating relationships and passing on priceless traditions. Additionally, students generally dedicate more time to their passions, communities, and appreciation of the arts.
Consequently, many Italian adults have numerous “job titles”, such as a lawyer by day, cheesemaker by night. It’s also common for people to work across various industries, instead of being pigeonholed into one. The freedom that comes with guaranteed higher education creates more opportunities to become successful in a field of your choosing, rather than a field that can most-efficiently pay off $100k+ student debt — as is often the case in America.
While competition is, of course, healthy, especially in business, I think we Americans often forget that life itself is not a competition. We must strive for meaningful lives — not only aim for high test scores, job-titles, and bank accounts, simply to out-shine the next person.
Italy’s economy is far from perfect, however, living in this country during good times, and recent times of difficulty has proven to me that quality of life defines a country much more than its GDP. Italians have come together to face this crisis as a unified and optimistic society, something I’m very proud to be a part of, now, more than ever.
#Andràtuttobene — Everything will be alright.

February 13, 2013.
We finally felt ready to start our Europe tourist circuits since our kids have grown enough to be able to sustain the walking around and making use of the full days you spend on this wonderful vacationing continent. Italy and Switzerland combination is what we picked — one country full of history, culture, art and character while the other is one of the most endowed places by nature gods. They are next to each other in Europe so no long intra-continent travel was involved. After much research we decided to drive around Italy and use the train system in Switzerland. I thought that was a great choice and would highly recommend doing that.
We have been doing a whole lot of trips in Asia and in the Americas and so making reservations and planning this trip to Europe was a new experience. Help of experienced friends, internet booking sites and plenty of travel tips from people on Trip advisor was a big help. Things like booking entry into the St Mark’s Basilica beforehand, the use of skip the line tour booking for Vatican, staying in Lauterbrunnen instead of Interlaken, car seat requirements in Europe, making sure about Air conditioning & parking spaces in hotels, keeping passports & cash safe, and second class Swiss pass is good enough (no need for first class) were some very useful tips. Our experience with Emirates for Flights, and Booking.com for booking hotels was very good. For planning our itinerary we used a combination of Frommer’s and Trip advisor write-ups. I also downloaded Rick Martin’s audio guides for Rome, Vatican and Venice — this helped me plan our days better.
Emirates flies 3 times a day from Hyderabad and connects very well to all locations in Europe. So we took nice and comfortable Emirates flights and landed in Rome on July 13th. The immigration process was the quickest I have seen — literally open the passport on visa page and stamp it. The Baggage area seemed old & run down as compared to all the new Indian airports and we had a broken wheel for our duffle bag — not the greatest start. But the airport pick up service we had booked from our hotel Fiume was good and the lady driver was friendly, took us through the Ancient Rome scenic drive — and we had our first breath taking view of the Colosseum — it was late evening so it was lighted up and looked majestic.
Although it was about 10pm by the time we were checked in and settled in the room, we wanted to just get started. So took a map and asked for basic directions from the hotel desk and walked through beutiful Rome streets to Spanish Steps. So one tip is to stay in the city boundary in Rome and second it is incredibly safe & the city is alive till quite late in the night, 1am or so. We clicked a few snaps and then took a rickshaw ride to Trevi Fountain, where we had our first pizza / pasta dinner. The fountain itself was a beautiful site in the night and we just sat on the steps with lot of people around till quite late.
July 14th we had a 10:30 am booking with “What A Life Tours” company for the guided tour of Vatican and Sistine Chapel. We used a taxi to make sure we reach on time and I was a little worked up about the dress code for the Vatican — but it seems people take it casually and you just need to tie a stole or something around bare shoulders for the Sistine Chapel. One thing though, Vatican is just too crowded and it was really hot on the outside at this time of the year — I would suggest winter time as a better time to visit Rome overall. Vatican is so full of the art treasures of the world, and it is so interesting to hear about how each Pope had a different approach to leaving their mark on the Vatican. Picture clicking were not allowed in Sistine Chapel but Michelangelo’s work is amazing with the imagination, the painting itself, the fact that this was done standing with utmost care using plaster art in 1508–12, simply awesome. And then St. Peter’s Basilica reminded of so many movies shot in this area both inside and the square outside — the shape of the church as a Cross, the holy Door, Michelangelo as an architect showing up strongly in the Dome and in his work Pieta (Mary with Jesus on her lap) were moving sites for me. The older walls, the air ducts, and the tombs underneath the basilica are a must see. Our guide Ana was great, energetic and interesting, in fact we paid extra to continue with her for the tour of the St. Peter’s Basilica. We had some really nice fresh pizza lunch sitting on a mat on the steps of the shop just outside Vatican and took a bus for Trastevere.
Trastevere is the areas south of the Vatican and means “beyond the Tiber” river. This is one of the most charming area of Rome with narrow medieval lanes, restaurants and just beautiful to walk around. Lot of picture perfect corners and buildings. We just strolled around the area and thoroughly enjoyed the leisurely time. We took a bus back to the hotel from across the river. But we were still not done — I read on the internet that night time Colosseum is beautiful so we took a bus to the ancient marvel of a building. It was nice, few pictures and sitting in the cool breeze for some time was good. This was a tough day for the kids because of all the walking in Vatican but they held well to my surprise, we did use stroller for the younger one.
Ancient Rome was the plan for the next day. We had breakfast at the hotel and reached Colosseum early at its opening time. The queues were already building up. One of the tips we had was to go the Forums first and buy the ticket there as it is the same ticket that is used for Colosseum. But we did not do it as I really wanted to get inside Colosseum early while it was not hot and spend time there — I will admit that I was mesmerized by this structure and that is why you can notice that I have already mentioned this building several times in this post. What we did was we took one audio / video guide for me, this was a separate line with almost zero waiting time to get in for this — this is probably the perfect way to beat the queue. I am a history enthusiast and to feel what it would have been inside this building 2000 years ago was breathtaking. In fact my wife and my elder daughter also enjoyed the structure as much as I did. For me, it was one of the high points of our trip and we did click a whole lot of pictures. From here, we went to the Forum’s where I used Rick Martin’s walking tour. It was really hot at this time and very tiring for the kids — so we rushed it a bit and focused only on some of the high point’s like the Arch of Constantine outside the forums, house of Vestal Virgins, Arch of Septimius Severus, place of Caesar’s murder. The view from the street of the Markets to Trajan was really nice. This part of Rome warranties a multi-day visit for a history student and perhaps in a cooler weather.
After lunch we walked to the Pantheon, another massive architectural marvel. From there onto the Piazza Navona. This is a beautiful square with lots of artists displaying their work, we bought some really nice paintings here and had one of the several rounds of gelato while in Italy. Rest a while in many of the beautiful squares, get water from the fountains, and walk the streets was the order of the day. We walked right up to Spanish mountains passing through the street with all the well-known big brand showrooms. We spent the evening at Villa Borghese park, a nice break from all the city walking for kids to have some fun. We rented a self-driven rickshaw type thing, rode a Segway for the first time, and dipped our feet in cool fountain water.
Next day started our road trip around Italy. We picked up our pre-booked car from Hertz on the train station. It took us almost 3 hours to pick up the car (frustrating), the GPS we took did not work, and consequently we got lost in Rome for couple of hours. Finally for rest of the trip the age old method of asking when lost and having printed directions is what we did to find our way around. We drove first to Sienna, and stayed in a beautiful chalet. The place we stayed in itself was a 2 floor room with a kitchenette, with olive garden setting and a small pool overlooking the hills. The COOP grocery store was nearby, so we went shopping there and that night cooked sumptuous rajma chawal with cherries to top it all. A nice glass of Chianti wine with the meal was a big plus. The town itself was a really beautiful little place with narrow walkways with incredible medieval buildings. The long combination escalator to go from the foot hills to the town was an experience in itself. The weather was a welcome cool one and we stayed till quite late in the town. The Piazza del Campo, site for annual horse racing event was impressive with lots of people just sitting and lying down in the square on its slating floors.
Our plan to drive through the Chianti area was another high point of the trip. We small winding roads, beautiful hills, occasional medieval time buildings atop the hills, farms around us were breathtaking. We stopped over in a village, Chianti village Castillina, which looked like right out of a movie set. We reached Pisa by the afternoon and here we stayed in a hotel right in the center of the town next to the leaning tower. So we got to spend our entire stay looking and walking around the famous monument. Overall, I thought Pisa was disappointing. The tower itself is not really impressive and the town itself is nothing to write home about. One could easily pass it without missing a bit of the Italy experience. We had decided to skip Florence this time because of kids. We saved it for our second Italy trip :-), maybe without the kids that time.
Drive to Venice was uneventful and efficient as i was quite use tod riving in Italy by now. Here there was another smart thing I learned from trip advisor write ups — we stayed in Mestre — better hotels, enough parking and literally 10 mins from Venice across the ocean bridge. I would say that is the smartest thing to do if you are driving and/ or are with kids and need more spacious room. Venice is romantic, enchanting and it did not feel like leaving the city even after just roaming around for 6–7 hours. The best things to do are to take the Grand Canal ride in vaporetto (water taxi) and then just get lost in the streets of Venice. The mask shops, the small bakeries, the gelato shops were all quite an experience. We had also happen to attend a fund raising music concert in one of the squares which was nice. The gondola ride is ridiculously expensive and a waste of time & money. The main tourist spot St. Mark’s square and Basilica are nice but very crowded until 5pm when the cruise ships leave. For the basilica, it is best to pre-book the entry time online. We were also told that the food here is bad and expensive, but we felt that if you do not want to get very fancy then it is not that bad. Overall, nothing compares to the unique experience of this city.
Onto to Switzerland. We were to spend 9 days in Switzerland and the plan was to start from Geneva with stays in Montreux, Interlaken and Lucerne; and fly out of Zurich. I did not get any good advice on how to get from Venice to Geneva / Montreux. The flights were expensive and not used normally, the direct train is no longer available and wastes a lot of time. I decided to drive the good 600 Kms and drop the car off at Geneva airport. I had lots of apprehensions about this long drive but it turned out to be a great decision. The Italy highway part was fast and then the drive through France, through Mt. Blanc area, was a beautiful drive. We dropped off the car at Geneva airport and took the train around Geneva Lake to Montreux. Before you start using the Swiss pass it needs to be validated at the station but after that it works like a charm. The SBB train system is great.
Montreux is a small city on the other side of Lake Geneva. The lake side walk, small sections for kids to play in the lake itself and view of the mountains is breathtaking. We had our taste of some decent middle eastern food also here. We slept early and next day morning on July 20th we had reservations for a whole day excursion on “Chocolate Train” from Golden Pass train system. I had done these booking on internet beforehand itself but the ticket seemed to be easily available. This tour had mixed reviews but we decided to do for kids, they can have fun as this included visits to a cheese factory and a chocolate factory. I would say that if you are spending enough time in Switzerland then it is not bad at all as one gets to experience internal Switzerland at leisure without too much planning. Kids were excited about the 2 factory visits with unlimited chocolate eating, and the village Gruyeres was postcard beautiful. One can smell the cows and the valley views were amazing. Evening we spent more time at the lake and got ready to leave early morning.
Montreux — Interlaken — Lucerne part is narrow gauge and serviced by golden pass trains. The Swiss pass works just fine, if you want you could do online reservations for extra money but we did not need it. Two tips — find out the time for the Panorama trains as they have the large glass windows for better views; and second not reserving is better as you can sit anywhere without looking for your reserved seats throughout the train. The train ride to Interlaken OST was beautiful and from there we took connecting 20 mins train to Lauterbrunnen. Here although the hotel was just a 3 mins walking distance, one thing we found out was that the shops closes down by 6ish, secondly we reached by 2 but our hotel reception was closed till 4 — now it may just be our hotel but this was indeed odd. Also, the hotel owner was a unco-operative guy and picked fights with lot of guests. Swiss hotels are expensive, with small rooms and limited service in general. We did find a restaurant next to our hotel though which served some great vegetarian food — homemade kind of burger, nice pizza and even had some Indian curry dishes. The information center was very very useful, answered all our questions, helped us plan our outings, gave us good weather information to decide where to go on which days.
Lauterbrunnen was like a “seven star hill station” in my wife’s words. Small village with one main street with all the hotels, view of the snowcapped Jungfrau ranges, waterfalls around the village were all beautiful site. It was a pleasantly cold here after the rather hot Italy weather. We hiked up one of the hills for a view from behind the waterfalls. It was raining for most of the evening and probably snowing up in the mountains. So we planned for Jungfrau the next day, as weather would be clearer and we might see some fresh snow. Now this one was another amazing experience — the train system itself is amazing going up such a height, the way the crowd is handled is efficient and the Jungfrau station set up is nicely organized. As expected there was nice fresh snow and kids had a blast playing in the snow — making snow man, and doing the tubing & sledging for more than 3 hours. We over packed our coats, it was not that cold — what is really needed is the right shoes, gloves, sunscreen of course sun glasses. The ice cave was nicely done too.
We spent 2 more days here in Lauterbrunnen and thoroughly enjoyed them with a great Alps experience. One day we took a cruise in Lake Thun, roamed around in Thun and Interlaken. Interlaken and in several places in Switzerland one can also do para gliding, we decided to skip it though. We were dying for Indian food and so this was the day we had a great meal at Taj Mahal restaurant in Interlaken. In Thun, we also discovered that McDonalds in Switzerland serves the Veggie burger similar to India — kids just loved that and that was our savior for kids over next few days in Switzerland. Second day we went to Mt. Murren and then to Grendelwald where we took the long cable car to First. Here the facilities for skiers in winters, and hikers in summers is great, we enjoyed some hiking, thoroughly soaked into the breath taking views of the valley and then kids had a great time in a play area at this high altitude. Another note on food — as our hotel did not serve breakfast — we used COOPS a lot. We bought nice bread, olives, dips, fruits & vegetables and made sandwiches which the kids loved. All of us were kind of getting bored of the regular breakfast items in restaurants so this was good change.
July 25th we reached Lucerne, which turned out to be a surprisingly large city. We stayed right at the edge of the “old city”. Walking around in this area was very enjoyable with lot of window and actual shopping. We visited the Natural History museum which was OK and the spent time around the canal which had beautiful flower arrangements on the 2 wooden bridges. It turned out that this was also the time for the annual “Blue Bells” music festival. The late evenings when the shops were closed the festival was at its full bloom with number of temporary street shops around the lake, live performances and just so many people having fun. There were very few kids as lot of smoking and drinking was going on. There were food stalls from every part of the world — people were just having a very good time. For our second day we took the train to Engelberg and went up the famous Mt Titlis. We wanted to make sure we did not miss it as this is part of the itinerary for all tours from India, though knowledgeable folks had told us that it would be same as Jungfrau. It was same — but only not as good. The glacier seems to be receding fast, the snow itself was not as pure and soft, the ice cave was a disappointment — but it did not stop the kids from having fun on the snow sledges and had couple of hours of good time. Engelberg on the foothills is a nice quite town and we spent some leisure time along the stream which seemed like a natural flow of water. On 27th, we took our direct train to Zurich airport and flew back to Hyderabad, completing a long awaited and incredibly enjoyable trip.
But before I finish I want to talk about a lot of interesting and delightful findings for us. No one told us about them, neither were they mentioned on the travel sites or books. For one, the ever running water fountains which had perfectly drinkable water was amazing. At first when we saw people filling their water bottles from the fountain at Spanish Steps in Rome we were surprised, and so we asked around and asked at our hotel, as well as the guide at the Vatican Museums to be doubly sure. After that we used it to the full — cool, clean water and free :-). Another very nice concept we saw especially in Switzerland was a COOP store outside of all the railway stations, easy to find and best place to get stuff for a quick snack or making your own sandwich or getting some nice fresh fruits to carry around for kids. Everyone must use them whenever they travel to this part of the world.
The way Swiss pass with a free family card worked for us was also beyond my expectations. Firstly the train network & punctuality in Switzerland is amazing and one needs to experience it to believe it. Lot of people told us about it but still i was positively surprised. Then the coverage on the pass with museums, buses, cruises, discounts on excursions — it was completely worth every penny.
I really should also mention the highways system between cities in Italy. It was again in some ways probably even better than what I saw in US. The “Autostrade” and the state highway network, Strade Statal, abbreviated SS, was great where one could drive at 130Km/h safely and without hassles. Trucks and slow moving vehicles stick to the right lane and if you do not then the guy wanting to overtake you would be touching you bumper at the back literally at that high speed :-), fairly effective system huh. What is more, never did I find a cop lurking around to catch you for smallest of violations. Italians are truly kings on the road :-).
And then the unique architectures. Italy had these medieval time cobble streets with vertical 3 or 4 floor or so buildings right next to each other in almost every city. The doors to these buildings would be massive wooden ones with big bolts and operated using electronic systems. We kept peeping into them and guessed about the insides of these buildings until finally we stayed in one such building in Pisa — our hotel was really an apartment in a building like this. Switzerland on the other had had these beautiful 2 floor buildings with hut shape tops. The Windows almost always had a false door of wood on the outside (or so it seemed), with a simple grill and flower arrangements on the ledge. It looked really pretty.
Now for the things that did not go so well. Firstly, the rental car process, things are really not as smooth or transparent as one would find in the US. It was not clear that if I picked up the car in Rome and dropped in Geneva, there would be about Euro 370 extra charges — that is quite a bit of money and I found out only after the charges showed up on my credit card. And then this was my first time driving in Europe and I was relying on my GPS to work, it just did not and it seems it is a routine issue as no one at the rental car company was surprised when I reported that. Also, they could not fix the problem when i visited the agency again. Then there was the issue of drive from Venice to Geneva I had to cross country borders twice, to pass through France, and that meant I had to pay the Euro 40 charges twice. It really should have something like a one day validity.
We are all vegetarians and were told horror stories of lack of food options for us. But we do love Italian food, Pizza and Pasta, so I was fairly confident that we would be fine. We carried some Indian spiced up snacks so we could take care of once in a while cravings and also carried few boxes of Cup-O-Noodles for kids just in case they did not get adjusted to the food types. But things worked out fine. There were enough vegetarian options on the typical roadside European restaurants and also Gelato was a of course a big hit. Towards the end of the trip we did start missing the Indian spices so we looked up Taj Mahal Restaurant in Interlaken as I already mentioned, and it was great. And once again doing groceries in COOP and then making our own Sandwiches was an option we used more than once, and loved it.
I would say a truly memorable vacation. Europe is beautiful, clean and very touristy as well as provides options to find your own style of spending your precious vacation time.

We’ve learned to enjoy the “hub and spoke” approach to travel. We pick a hub town to stay several days and then plan day trips out from there. That way, we immerse ourselves in one location and aren’t moving every other day. This style of travel provides a more comfortable, relaxed pace.
A good hub is an interesting town located in the center of an area with sights around it. You’re looking for a spot that allows you easy day trips to other locations. We picked general areas and then zoomed in to look for interesting Airbnb possibilities.
We’ll land in Venice at Marco Polo Airport and take a shuttle to the rental car place. I used Kayak to find quotes and make a reservation. We didn’t need a big car (and good luck driving one on tiny European roads anyway). Plus, gas is expensive. I’ve read Italian drivers are intense but at least we’ll be on the familiar side of the road. If we can drive in Ireland, we can drive anywhere.
We’ll do a counter-clockwise circuit through northern and central Italy beginning in the hill town of Feltre. That will provide us a base to explore the Dolomites in the Italian Alps. Then we’ll head west to Torno on Lake Como and south to the Cinque Terre on the Mediterranean. We’ll then go southeast into Tuscany to a village near Siena before finishing for a week back in Venice.
We’ve used Airbnb to stay in unique homes across Germany, Ireland and the US. Often, the prices are much lower than hotels, especially as you add more people. Plus, you get a whole place to yourself, lots of privacy, more bathrooms and a kitchen for cooking. Most importantly, you’re more integrated into the everyday life of the place you’re visiting.
We use search filters to specify we’re looking to rent an entire place plus request key amenities like Wifi, washing machine and the number of beds/baths we need. The calendar for each place shows availability.
You can rate and review places you’ve stayed. You’re also rated by the renters as a guest. It’s a self-monitoring system similar to eBay. You converse with the owner directly and can negotiate the price, especially if you stay multiple days (another reason to hub and spoke your trip).
The village of Feltre in the Veneto is our first hub. It’s located about an hour-and-a-half drive north of Venice with the Dolomites serving as a dramatic backdrop. The plan is to explore the mountains and nearby towns like Bassano Del Grappa and Trento.
After three nights in Feltre, we’ll meander west along the mountains to the lake district. We’ll stay for a week in an old villa along Lake Como in the village of Torno. Along with the lakeside towns of Bellagio and Como, we’ll plan on making day trips to Milan, Mantua and Bergamo.
Here’s an example of how we used Airbnb to find our place in Torno. We wanted to stay around the lake and used the map feature. Once you zoom in on specific homes/apartments, you can view photos and research the area.
Yes, that looks pretty good! After a week around the lake, we’ll then head south toward the Ligurian coast on the Mediterranean for three days.
Cinque Terre is a string of five centuries-old villages featuring colorful houses and vineyards clinging to the rugged coastline. We’re looking forward to riding the slow train that connects each of the towns and then exploring from the sea by taking the boat service.
After our stay along the sea, we’ll head inland to the heart of Tuscany. We found a villa in the middle of vineyards roughly 30 minutes west of Siena. This will provide us a base to explore large sights like Florence, Pisa and Lucca as well as smaller Tuscan hill towns like Monteriggioni, Pistoia and Civita.
Here’s how I used Google Maps to tag interesting “spoke” sights around our five hubs locations. We’re not planning on visiting this many places but it gives me a good list from which to choose once we’re in Italy. I color-coded sights by hub. With my Google Map on the cloud, I can pull this up while on the road and we can explore. This is where pre-trip research is key.
For example, we’re planning on visiting Arezzo to the east of Siena to take in a big market held on the first weekend in October. I tagged the location and we should be able to find it with minimal trouble.
We’ll wrap up our Italian tour with a week in Venice. We found an Airbnb in a quieter, less-touristed sestiere (neighborhood). I’m looking forward to having time to just explore. Early mornings and late evenings this time of year should be much less crowded. I’m not sure you can ever soak in enough Venice.
My next post should be from Italy on Thursday if the Wifi situation cooperates. Until then, arrivederci!

I hope this update finds you well.
I’ve been back from Italy for about six weeks and am still in the process of digesting all my learning from my trip. It was a fantastic experience, and I’m glad to have had my first international experience.
I will continue to update this article with photos from different days of the trip as time goes on. Nevertheless, I wanted to publish this partially completed version so as to ensure it doesn’t end up in my drafts, never to be shared with the world.
Enjoy this post,
Josh

THE TRAVEL PLANS
The plan was to visit Italy for just over three weeks, with a few days at Rome prior to joining a Tour of Italy for two weeks, with a return to Rome for an extra six or so days at the end of the tour.
We completed the Italy’s best tour with Cosmos. The tour in our trip saw us complete the following:

Places visited:
**********
TAKING A TRAVEL JOURNAL
I decided to take a travel journal to reflect both on my learning, and also to collect receipts, business cards, postcards, holy cards and other trinkets as I toured the country. All in all, I ended up with so much stuff I had to pack all the material collected separately, but there was a lot of value in journalling.
The travel journal I used was made by Typo and can be purchased here:
http://cottonon.com/US/p/typo/the-wanderer-travel-journal/2013463501982.html#start=1
Whilst I didn’t use all of the sections on this tour, I did make use of the following sections:
What follows is my notes from the notes, daily adventures, things I learnt along the way, and second notes sections. I have interspersed photos, post-travel commentary and other relevant pieces of information to make these more useful for future reference.

NOTES:

29/06/16
We’re leaving tomorrow morning. I’m starting to pack and get things ready now, following my usual, last minute routine.
I’m looking forward to heading off, and am glad to finally be on holidays from work.
Requests to complete for people while I’m away:
Post-travel note: I made a video for each of these requests on my iPhone and sent them to the people concerned before I returned home.

My first ever view of an international country (Hong Kong) from a plane.
We’ve survived our trip from Australia to Hong Kong. Shortly we will be boarding our second flight, which will take us to Rome.
I’ve followed Courtney’s advice and kept awake thus far. If I can push myself a few hours more and then sleep on the plane I should be close to achieving Rome’s time with my body clock.
I purchased a 500 ml Coke whilst here, which cost 28 Hong Kong dollars. There was a girl here who unrolled her yoga mat and proceeded to do a lot of poses… I was amazed by her flexibility. I have contacted Vanessa.
Whilst on the plane I watched:
I had chicken and rice and nearly choked on an asparagus-like vegetable. I also had pork noodles, which were nice.
Praise God for this wonderful opportunity.
******
01/07/16
I’m on the plane and we are a few hours from landing in Rome. Sleep has been nearly impossible on this plane, so I’m going to be suffering from jet lag when we arrive.
So far the food on this flight hasn’t been as good as the prior one. Nevertheless, things are more exciting now.
I watched the movie for ‘the Entourage’ on this flight, read some more of ‘The Imitation of Christ’, completed this journal entry and tried to sleep, albeit unsuccessfully.
At Rome:
We went to our accommodation and checked in our bags, as we can’t access our room until 2:00pm. From there, we checked out the Pantheon, the St. Ignatius Church (photos of the roof below), some other churches and Trevi Fountain.
We had lunch @ Vacanza Romana. First impression of Italian Pizzas is that D.O.C. in Australia is very authentic.
Also, my rosary broke but I seem to have been able to fix it.
We went for a walk again later in the day. Whilst doing this, we stumbled upon a Mass, where I went up for a blessing from the priest. Prior to that, we had Galati from a place at Trevi Fountain, which was amazing.
We also checked out some Roman ruins at the end of our hotel’s street earlier in the day.

DAILY ADVENTURES
The weather was: Sunny
Day / date: 01/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Land, check-in, get food and rest, and see some sites.
My daily adventures: See earlier notes for info on today.
We also picked up some water from a Marian fountain; I’ve consumed most of it though.
I’m also impressed with the number of drinking fountains in Rome that are free to use, and the quality of the water that comes from these. Apparently there are 1300+ in Rome, which is really impressive.
My desire to learn Latin has substantially increased.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 02/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Revisit some Churches, visit the Colosseum, Colosseum night tour, and take photos, Trastavere, look for gifts.
My daily adventures: We went to the Roman Forum, which was spectacular! We stumbled upon an ancient Marian Church that is on display there until September. We got a lot of photos, so that was exceptionally well timed.
The Colosseum was fascinating, and it was incredible to tick it off the bucket list. The night tour of it was even more exceptional. Pizza from the corner shop was okay but not the best. Really cheap though. At the Colosseum, we met an Australian woman who said she thought that the Italians lived in a museum. I thought she was pretty accurate with that comment.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 03/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia and Vatican City
Plans for the Day: Attend Mass, visit the Vatican, Check out of hotel, join and commence our two-week tour.
My daily adventures: Went to Vatican, St Peter’s Square. Bought 300 Euro odd-dollars’ worth of Rosaries, etc. which we had blessed in the Papal blessing. Moved to the new hotel. It has a bigger room but has a less comfortable bed. We met our Tour Director (Lambros in Gk. or Alex in Italian) then Mum and I went and had chips and lasagne (which was beautiful) at a local Italian restaurant that her and Courtney had eaten at year’s prior.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 04/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Sistine Chapel, St Peter’s Basilica, Roman Forum, Colosseum, Dinner.
My daily adventures: This was our first day with the tour.
Sistine Chapel — amazing! We will definitely need to revisit this & St. Peter’s basilica to spend more time taking it in. The tour guide was great, but I felt we didn’t get as much time in the Colosseum and Forum as was necessary. I was very grateful we had visited them previously. Dinner was good, consisting of bruschetta, pasta with peas, lasagne, chicken and potatoes, then gelato and coffee.
I’m not sure how these places are able to make a profit, so I assume it is through bulk cooking that they are able to do so. Dinner was accompanied by a flute player and a guitarist, which was nice.
P.s. Today we also met our bus drive Pino.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / day: Tuesday 05/07/16
Destination: Roma, Pisa, Montecatini — Italia
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
On our way from Rome I felt really sick from the bus motion. Consequently I loaded up on my travel tables. As of lunchtime (now), I’m in a medically induced tiredness. We then went to Pisa and saw the leaning tower. Lunch was pizza and biscotti from some street shops. We opted to check out the Cathedral, Baptistery and the cemetery rather than climb the tower. I tried European Maccas there. We had dinner @ Montecatini at a local winery / olive oil farm. The food and wine were delicious and we had great company.
******
The weather was: Sunny with clouds
Day / date: 06/07/2016 — Wednesday
Destination: Florence, Italia
Plans for the day: visit Florence
My daily adventures:
We went to Florence today and got to do a tour with a local guide. From there we went to a local market sitting on a bridge. There is lots of jewellery and leather in Florence, but it is expensive. The highlight of the day for me was paying 15 Euro to go to the Cathedral, baptistery and Museum. We saw some relics, etc. Back at Montecatini, we went to the Funicular and then had dinner at the hotel. I then had a few drinks at the bar.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 07/07/16
Destination: La spezia, cinque terre, Levanto, Genoa, Italia
Plans for the day: Have pesto, check out local village markets, possibly visit the beach, go somewhere nice for dinner
My daily adventures: Today we went to la spezia to catch a train to the cinque terre. Whilst there we visited Vernazza and Monterosso. At Vernazza I looked at the Church, went up to the tower and walked around. At Monterosso we walked around the old section, had pesto @ Ristorante ‘Da Ely” and I ought a beach towel for 10 Euro. We then caught a train to Levanto, where our bus took us to our accommodation in Genoa, a nice, four star hotel. We then went to dinner at a place recommended by our tour Director Lambros, but I didn’t think it was that great.
******
The weather was: Sunny with clouds, cloudy
Day / date: 08/07/2016
Destination: Genoa, Milan, Lake Maggiore, Italia
Plans for the day: as above, with tour dinner
My daily adventures: We had a tour of Genoa with a local guide. They were very knowledgeable, but I didn’t find Genoa as impressive as some of the other locations we have visited. From there, we drove to Milan. I checked out the Cathedral, had Maccas for lunch, bought some Galati and visited the local shops. We then went to Lake Maggiore. We’re staying in a nice hotel here, although we had to get the bed adjusted from a double to a twin share. We had dinner on a nearby island as part of the tour, sitting with two Australia couples.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 09/07/2016
Destination: Lugano, Switzerland
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: We took the bus from Lake Maggiore to Lugano, crossing the boarder into Switzerland. From there, we went to Monte Tamaro, where we had some lunch and got to see an amazing view. To do this, we had to catch a chair lift up and back. After this, we came back to the hotel.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 10/11/2016
Destination: Verona and Venice, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: we left our hotel and went to Verona, where we had a tour of the place and got to touch the boob of the statue of Juliet. We had lunch there and I had really nice pasta. From there, we drove to our hotel near Venice. At night, we went to dinner in Venice and had a quick look around. The food wasn’t too great (in my humble opinion) but Venice was beautiful.

After that, we went and got a replacement earring for Julie, before getting lunch. I had pasta and a 500ml bottle of Chianti to myself, which left me a little drunk for the afternoon. We didn’t get to see inside St. Mark’s Basilica, but we were able to see other churches, including S. Giovanni Basilica. We had some ice cream, looked at shops, went back to the hotel and had dinner with some Spanish and NZ friends.

At Assisi, we visited the Basilica, which was amazing! Three churches on top of one another! We bought some things at the gift shop and then headed over to our hotel in Perugia for the evening, where we had dinner.
“This is a beautiful country.” (My reflection in the margin at 3:15pm on bus in rural area on the way to Assisi)

My daily adventures: We caught a bus to Positano, where it was raining. This is the only day so far that it has been raining whilst we have been on tour. We checked out Santa Maria Assunta Esan Vito whilst there. From there, we made our way back to Rome, only stopping briefly at two places to get some food and to have a toilet stop, because traffic jams caused us some delays. The dinner was a bit disappointing, but the company was nice with a brief tour on the bus following at night, along with a stop over at Trevi Fountain.

My daily adventures: We had breakfast with our kiwi friends prior to moving to our old hotel. 140 Euro a night to sleep on a couch, as Mum had the bed. Anyway, we went and checked out the temples of portuna and Hercules, the mouth of truth and related basilica, another church and basilica, picked up some holy water, crucifix and prayer card, ate pizza and Maccas, washed clothes. I bought a guide to the pantheon (which we revisited) and read it, and also bought a bottle of cheap Chianti for consumption prior to the trip home.

My daily adventures: Today we went to Mass @ the Pantheon. This was cool, as they turned on all the lights and cleared the tourists out for it. There were only 18 or so people 5 minutes beforehand, but it ended up with about 100 or so. From there, we met up with Anita & Ryan after lunch and walked to the catacombs. These were so impressive, and definitely worth the 8 Euro to get in. After this, we bought some pizza and had it on our hotel’s rooftop.

The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 18/07/2016
Destination:
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
We had a much needed and well-deserved sleep in and low start to the day. We then walked to Trastavere, and had a look around (although there was not much to see). Afterward, we walked to Castel Sant Angelo, and paid to walk around inside. It was quire impressive, but left me pondering why Pope Paul III had a room decorated about the pagan god Apollo. After relaxing, we went hunting for an ATM that worked and then had a nice dinner a few blocks behind the Pantheon.

Revisiting Romans 9
One of the religious topics I have most disputed in the last few years is, ‘Does God love all men?’ Historically, I have said no on the basis of Romans chapter 9.
After hearing a sermon on 1 Timothy 2:4 (God desires all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth), I knew I could not accept an understanding that requires two wills in God or the verse to be interpreted to mean, ‘all elect men’, not ‘all men’.
The only section for which I had not been able to come to a reasonable conclusion about was this section in Romans 9, particularly:
Material consulted during the process included:
I understood the Calvinist position well, but was unable to understand the Catholic position on this scripture. They are not quite Calvinistic, Lutheran or Arminian. Nevertheless, a sermon by Adrian Rogers (not Catholic) helped me along with various writings of Thomas Aquinas (summa theologica and his notes on Romans) to finally see how people with other paradigms hold their position.
This position seems to me to make better sense of the particular text, of the scriptures as a whole, and of the Catholic position. Consequently, this post constitutes a retraction of my former position (unless it can be sufficiently demonstrated otherwise that this position is wrong).
The sermon by Adrian Rogers was as follows:

We just came back from an amazing week long trip to Italy with kids. We enjoyed great weather — it was 50–60 degrees in December, great scenery and of course delicious food.
Since I am a massive travel nerd, and we have seven people traveling, I planned everything down to a minute. It took quite a bit of time to prepare for the trip, but it was definitely worth it. Huge thanks to Joanne Wilson who gave me pointers and linked me to her post about trip to Rome.
We booked Airbnb, on via Panisperna, next to Colosseum, found an AWESOME tour guide, reserved restaurants for dinner, and bought the tickets for train and museums in advance.
Arrive Rome 12:35PM, settle in apt by 3PM
Lunch: Antico Bakery, via dei Shiavari 54
Evening: Walk around Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps
Dinner: Re-cafe, Piazza Augusto imperatore, 36
We arrived at noon and boarded a van that was ordered for us by our Airbnb host. The ride was about 30 minutes and cost €80.
We settled in our apartment on via Panisperna, which was right by St. Maria Maggiore, Termini and a Colosseum. The apartment was quirky and fun. Bathroom decorations stood out.
After unpacking we needed to grab food. We headed to the famous Antico bakery for lunch. Unfortunately it was closed due to St Stephane holiday and we went to Alice pizza instead. Alice is a popular chain that makes small, thin, square pizzas of different kinds. It’s actually really good.
After lunch we headed to Trevi Fountain to enjoy, and take pictures. It was very crowded, but kids really liked it. A few blocks from Trevi fountain we found gelato San Crispino, which was on our top 10 gelato places. It was pretty amazing, especially banana, and apple flavors.
We then headed to Spanish Steps. The area was bustling and festive. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the lights. We claimed the steps all the way up and took a bunch of pictures.
After Spanish Steps we went for dinner at Re-caffe. The service was slow and inattentive, but the food was pretty good.
Morning: Colosseum and Ancient Forum
Lunch: Trieste, via Urbana 112
Afternoon: Fountains of Rome tour, Campo Di Fiori
Dinner: Cul De Sac, Piazza di Pasquino 73
We woke up early and headed to a local breakfast place. We stumbled upon La Licata — an awesome place that had variety of croissants and sandwiches including vegan, and glutton free. Coffee was great too. Right after breakfast we took 5 min walk to Colosseum, where we met with Simone our guide.
Simone came highly recommended and didn’t disappoint. For the next 3 days he gave us most insightful, and interesting historical tours we’ve ever had.
Per Simone’s suggestion we bought Colosseum tickets online, and didn’t have to wait. The tour started with Simone talking about the construction, types of stones and techniques that made up Colosseum.
As we made our way up Simone talked about gladiators, their training, lives and strategy they used to survive and thrive on the arena. Simone had encyclopedic knowledge of history, archeology, art, culture and languages and weaved together an amazing narrative.
With Simone’s help we were transported almost two thousand years back and the space came alive with vivid details.
We walked around the Colosseum, and learned about sitting arrangements, daily schedules, the economics of fighting, and even how romans made deals in the public bathrooms.
After Colosseum we headed across the street to ancient forum. Again history unfolded in great details because of Simone’s masterful story teller.
We talked about the origins of Christmas, and multiple meanings of the word messiah — both the god’s messenger and a king. We talked about Christianity and Constantine’s Arc, and how Nero killed himself and Trajan rushed back to claim the emperorship. We talked about Octavian conquering Jerusalem, and the original menorah imprinted on his arc. We talked about skillful manipulation, lies and propaganda that Roman senators, and emperors were so good at.
After the tour ended we visited Trajan’s market and column and headed to Trieste on via Urbana for lunch. Trieste is a relatively new place on a trendy via Urbana. It serves small round pizzas that are incredibly delicious. The owner was super nice, and super personable. He told us, that like true artist, he would never compromise and make pizza with ingredients he didn’t believe in. He said putting pepperoni on a pizza doesn’t make any sense. We agreed.
We sampled simple yet very delicious pizzas with mushrooms, artichokes, vegan without sauce and margarita. We also got a baked eggplant and Parmesan dish hat was very tasty. We finished lunch with Tiramisu, which was, without a doubt, the best one we’ve ever had.
After lunch we decided to go on a self guided tour of fountains of Rome. I saw the tour described on one of the websites and wrote it down. We started with Tritone fountain on Piazza Barberini. It’s a relatively small, but pretty fountain designed by Bernini.
Next we headed to Spanish steps, which were as busy as we found them yesterday, but less pretty because it was still daylight. At the foot of Spanish Steps we looked at another Bernini’s fountain called Ugly boat. We didn’t find it ugly, but we didn’t find it all that interesting either.
Next, according to the tour route, we were suppose to go to Trevi fountain, but since we visited it yesterday, we went straight to Piazza Navona instead.
The Piazza was very pretty with all the holiday lights and stands. We started with smaller fountain. It was really beautiful, and we took a bunch of pictures. We then moved on to Bernini masterpiece the Fountain of Four Rivers. We love the fountain, but even after reading about it and symbology it’s hard to tell which river is which.
We headed to Cul de Sac for dinner, a cozy place that came highly recommended by Joanne. The place didn’t disappoint. We shared a cheese platter, which was delicious. We enjoyed bean soup, spicy chicory. cheese ravioli, seafood black rice risotto and linguine with marinara sauce.
Morning: Skull and Bones Museum, Via Veneto 27
Lunch: Pasta Imperiale, Via dei Coronari 160
Afternoon: Vatican Museums and St Peter
Dinner: Sofia, Via di Capo le Case 51
We started day two with a breakfast at a place on via Urbana that wasn’t really great so I won’t mention it.
Our first stop was the Skull and Bones Museum — a strange place off Piazza Barberini. The entrance cost €8 for adults. We were very intrigued because the museum contained a crypt with art works made out of 4,000 skulls, and bones.
The place was literally amazing and unlike anything else we’ve ever seen. The photos weren’t allowed but I managed to take one anyway and after the guard made me delete it. We used the recover feature to restore it.
The crypt had 7 chapels each with a different arrangement and theme. Each featured different types of bones, and focused on different message about spirituality and death. It was creepy, beautiful and unlike anything else we’ve ever seen.
We bought a couple of magnets and bookmarks and headed to Campo Di Fiori. On the way over we stopped by Trevi fountain, which is always great to look at. Then we stumbled on St Ignazio Basilica and decided to explore it instead of going to Campo Di Fiori.
The basilica is quite large and beautiful. Tall ceiling has frescos in the style of Sistine Chapel with a very well done perspective. We explored chapels, tombs and oculus — all around very cool.
For lunch we headed to Pasta Imperiale on the gorgeous via dei Coronari.
Despite the fancy name this place proved to be a tiny hole in the wall, literally, we barely fit in. The pasta was absolutely delicious and super cheap only €5 each.
You could mix and match pasta and sauce. Gnocchi with pesto was the best. It simply melted in your mouth. Ravioli with spinach and ricotta were on point. We also had spaghetti and tagliatelle with marinara sauce. Pasta were just right and sauce was super fresh with chunks of real tomatoes. Portions weren’t big but the pasta was very filling.
Right after we headed over to Gelateria Del Teatro which was literally 20 steps away. We watched professional cannoli making through the window. Then we walked inside. Everything from gelato to cannoli was perfect.
No wonder this place was rated among top gelato places in Rome — delicious. We enjoyed a bunch of different flavors of gelato and cannoli — everything was absolutely great.
After lunch we headed to Vatican for our tour. A twenty minute walk ended with breathtaking views of casa St. Angelo and St. Peter. Kids were very impressed with the St Peter square, and we took a bunch of pictures.
Simone, our guide, was waiting for us by the entrance. Again, because he told us to buy Vatican museum tickets online we didn’t have to wait and went straight into the museum.
Simone gave us another unforgettable tour full of amazing historical details and insights. We started with Ancient Rome artifacts, and worked our way through tapestry and maps rooms to Sistine Chapel.
We continued the tour inside St Peter Cathedral and enjoyed Le Pieta and several sculptures by Bernini. Again our guide made the tour incredibly informative and engaging.
After the Vatican we took 45 min walk back to get to our dinner place, a restaurant called Sofia.
Great food, a little pricier than other places, but really good food. The place is small and very cozy. We shared mushroom and blue cheese pie, and for appetizer. For the main course we had risotto, bean soup, and cod with side of potatoes — all great. For desert we had chocolate cake and red courant cheesecake, which was amazing.
Morning: Tivoli
Afternoon: St Maria Maggiore
Dinner: La Taverna Dei Fori Imperiali, Via della Madonna dei Monti, 9
Day 4 was our first trip, a guided tour to Tivoli. We met with Simone and the driver at 8:30 near our house. Driver cost us €275 for entire tour. It made sense since there were 7 of us.
On the way over we talked about politics, economics, travel, history of Italy and many other things. Simone has truly encyclopedic knowledge, has taught in University of Rome, and has traveled the world. Every single conversation with him was awesome and exciting.
Tivoli is just a short 30 min ride from Rome. We first went to visit Hadrian’s villa. When Hadrian became an emperor he didn’t get along with the Senate, so he decided to not live on Palatine hill like other emperors, but rather decided to build a villa in Tivoli. To make sure the senators don’t disturb him and don’t try to kill him, Hadrian kept a legion of soldiers near by.
The ruins are rather well preserved and we enjoyed the tour very much. Hadrian designed the villa in a thoughtful and meticulous style. Imagine a modern house but each room amplified to be the size of a half or full football field — a study, gym, the dinning room, bathroom, etc. a study was a sacred place where emperor was meditating for days and couldn’t be disturbed.
Bath was used by the emperor and his servants, soldiers and even slaves. Dinning room was designed to be 3 different dining from rooms so that depending on the time of the day, sun angle and season you can pick the best combination — for example, cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.
Hadrian also was incredibly well traveled and recreated several of his favorite places inside the palace. For example he designed Egyptian style pool with statues running around, and actual crocodiles inside. He surrounded the pool with the dinning area, so his guests could eat in a reclined position and enjoy the view.
In the afternoon we went up to see villa d’Este, which was created by Cardinal Ippolito d’Este. Again, Simone took us on an amazing tour of history and gave us an awesome perspective on the villa. It turns out that the cardinal came from influential and powerful family that had close ties to France.
He was very close to becoming a pope, but German king vetoed his papacy. After a bitter loss the cardinal embarked on the quest to prove that he is a better men by spending over $1MM Scusi (likely close to $100mm in today’s money) over 20 years to build the villa.
It was worth it. The design of the villa is incredible. First, the villa itself featured beautiful rooms with frescos by famous painters. But the best part of the villa are the gardens with 50 fountains and 60 waterfalls, all ingeniously laid out and flawlessly executed.
We got back to Rome in early afternoon, and were in the mood for sweets. We used Foursquare to find that a highly rated Gelateria Fatamorgana was right next to our apartment. We headed there, and discovered tiny place with high quality gelato and no place to seat. Gelato was great, but we also needed coffee.
Next, we stumbled on the whole in the wall butcher shop with most amazing Italian pastry Sfogliatella. The owner of the shop only spoke numbers in English, but I discerned that he said eat it while it is hot. We ate all 3 and then went back got two more. It was just delicious.
After coffee we went up to see St Maria Maggiore, one of the biggest. Churches in Rome. We bought a quick tour to get up on the balcony to enjoy the view, and check out massive mosaic, papal rooms and a Bernini staircase.
We had dinner reservations at La Taverna Dei Fori Imperiali. But unfortunately it was closed and we went across the street to The problem is it was closed so we moved across the street to Angelino “ai fori”. The place was good, but not amazing.
8:00AM Train Rome => Florence
Snack: Antico Vinaio, via dei Neri 65
Morning: Academia, Ufizzi
Lunch: Eataly, Via dei Martelli 22
Afternoon: Duomo, Ponte Vecchio
Dinner: Mercado Centrale
9PM: Train to Rome
This morning we got up and headed to Termini to take 1.5h train to Florence. We bought tickets in advance using Italia rail web site. Ticket prices seem to vary and there are different web sites that sell them. Ours ended up being about €60 per person for the round trip.
Navigating train station is really easy, just look up your train number on a big screen to see the platform. The ride to Florence is quick and pleasant.
Our first stop in Florence was a famous sandwich shop Antico Vinaio. The sandwiches were super delicious — highly recommended.
Next we headed to Uffizi gallery. We bought Uffizi tickets online, but still had to stand in line to get the tickets, and then another line to get into the museum. The highlights are of course two paintings by Botticelli — Birth of Venus and Primavera. We also enjoyed Caravaggio and spent some time looking at pre-renaissance Italian painters.
After two hours kids were tired, and we went to lunch at La Fettuna, instead of walking to Eataly. This is a family style place where we had grilled chicken, gnocchi with tomato pasta, cheese, marinated artichokes, and thick soup made of vegetables and bread. Food was good, not amazing, but waiters were super friendly.
After lunch we went to walk through Ponte Vecchio which was super crowded, but really festive. After that we headed towards another bridge to have gelato at Santa Trinita. It was fabulous, I particularly enjoyed Strawberry sorbet.
Right next to the gelato place here was a shop with art supplies and kids wanted to check it out. They spent a bunch of time looking at different pencils, and markers and ended up buying a few.
We crossed the bridge, and headed back towards Duomo. The streets lid up with amazing lights and great atmosphere. When we got to Duomo the main church was closed, but we got into the baptistery and had a chance to admire it’s fantastic mosaic.
After baptistery kids and I headed to Campanile, and set to climb 414 steps up to the top. After 20 min wait we got in and started the climb. There was two way traffic and really hard to pass people. We kept going up and up and up and finally reached the very top.
It was very windy but the views were worth it. We took a few pictures and then started to go down. It was a little more awkward, but didn’t take long.
After the Campanile we walked around main square with a beautiful tree and then headed to the market.
The market in Florence is two floors and the second floor is entirely occupied by bistros, pizza, pasta and sandwich places. It’s one of the best markets in Europe, if not the best one, that we’ve been too.
The atmosphere was awesome. The food was just gorgeous and you didn’t know what to get. We finally settled on a pizza place, and also had a spinach rice ball, vegan soup and a bunch of cannoli.
After the market we took a short, 7 minute walk to the train and headed back to Rome. We were a bit bummed out that we didn’t get to Academia and Duomo, but overall we spent a great day in Florence.
Morning: Pantheon
Lunch: Obica: Via dei Prefetti, 26a angolo Piazza Firenze
Afternoon: Borghese Gallery
NYE: Circus Maximus
We decided to sleep in and got up around 9:30AM. After breakfast we took a walk to Pantheon. The entrance is free, and Pantheon is awesome. We read up on the history, and walked around.
Next we did a bit of souvenir hunting, and then went to Campo Di Fiori. We ran into a fresh fruit stand and couldn’t resist. The fruits were really delicious.
After the market we headed to our lunch place — Obica — a mozzarella bar. We ordered mozzarella, burrata, ricotta samplers and roasted eggplant and focaccia, several salads, soups and pastas. Everything was incredibly delicious, particularly cheeses and eggplant. This easily made our top 3 places of the trip.
After lunch we took 30 minute walk to up the hill to visit Villa Borgehese. This is one of the top museums in Rome, and we didn’t want to miss it. We bought tickets online ahead of time. You have to arrive at specific time and can only be in the museum for 2 hours.
The highlights of the museum were statues by Bernini including Apollo and Daphne, which is just breathtaking. Museum also features paintings by Caravaggio and Titan. Overall, it is a small museum, but it really packs the punch.
We went back towards our apartment, and decided to have dinner back at Trieste. As the first time pizzas were delicious. We also ordered soup of the day which was awesome. And, of course, we had to get the tiramisu again too.
After dinner we went back to apartment to rest before NYE.
At about 10pm we got back to the streets and headed to Colosseum and Circus Maximus to enjoy the New Year eve show. The streets were fairly crowded. We got to Circus Maximus about 11 pm. It was absolutely packed. It was super loud, and nearly impossible to breath because of smoke.
The show started with acrobats with drums flying over crowds. It was kind of cool and bizarre at the same time.
The crowds kept getting bigger, and it felt like at least several hundred thousand people there.
We waited until the countdown and joined the roar. 5 minutes after New Year we headed out, and walked home. Honestly the show was a little underwhelming but we had a good time anyway, and wer happy to be in Rome for 2017.
Day 7: Rome, New Years Day
We woke up late around 10:30am. Our plan was to go to Jewish Ghetto and Trastevere.
We had breakfast at Annalemma because our usual breakfast place was closed. The service was slow but yogurts with blueberries and omelette a where good. I got food next door at Ce Stamo a Pensa, which is a tiny street food place. Vegetable calzone and fried donut were absolutely delicious.
After breakfast we headed to Bocca dela Verita — a giant ancient face carved into a stone located near entrance to Santa Maria Cosmedin. We spent about 30 mins in line, waiting to stick our hands inside the mouth. The legend has it that of you tell a lie while holding your hand in the mouth, it will be bitten off.
With all our fingers and other body parts in tact we headed off towards Great Synagogue. We bought tickets to Jewish Museum, which also included a tour of synagogue. The museum was compact, but informative. The tour was kind of meh, but the synagogue was impressive.
After the museum we headed to via Portico d’Ottavia to sample local delicacies. The Bosscione bakery was closed, but we got a bunch of very tasty sweets at Cremeria Romana.
We then got fried artichokes at Yesh Sheni, and while looking for a place to eat them stumbled upon Bocca Di Dama. We bought coffee, hot chocolate, a couple of small hazelnut pastries, and one gelato. The gelato was chocolate and orange and the second scope was berries. Super delicious.
We made a two minute walk to see Fontane delle Tartarughe, a small but pretty fountain where dolphins got replaced by turtles. Right next to the fountain there was a cute pepper store.
After we headed to Trastevere, and crossed via Tiber Island — a tiny island with pretty views. We wanted to have dinner at Antico Carolone and stopped by to make a reservation. We got lucky, and got a table for 6:30 pm.
In Trastevere we first headed to St Cecile, a small church tucked in one of the smaller squares. The church had pretty courtyard.
We then went towards Santa Maria in Trastevere — the biggest church of the neighborhood. On the way we walked through more pretty streets. On the plaza before the church a street performer impressed us with her fire skills.
At 7:30 we got back to the restaurant and were immediately seated. The waiters were super warm and attentive. We ordered grilled vegetable antipasto and fried artichokes for appetizer and 3 kinds of pastas. Everything was very homey and very delicious.
In general we were surprised by home many food places where open on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day — a lot more than we would expect. Being in Rome for the holidays is no problem at all food wise, and attractions were open as well. The weather was really great 50 and sometimes close to 60. In the evenings it got, but never really cold.
Next day was our last day and we just did wanted to do the tour of our favorites — La Licata. Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pasta Imperiale, Gelateria Del Teatro, and, of course, Trieste pizza. We did manage to swing by St Peter in Vincoli which has spectacular statue of Moses by Michelangelo.
We had an amazing time in Rome in December and this was an unforgettable trip. Kids are already asking to go back ;)

This morning, I stopped by a coffee bar near my house. I’ve become friends with the barista, Stefano. As Stefano prepared my macchiato lungo, he said he had some sad news. His father, who had been ill for some time, had died. The funeral was canceled because of the restrictions imposed on the region.
Stefano placed my coffee on the counter. Normally, in an Italian coffee shop, you stand at the bar and drink the tiny cup of espresso. I took a few sips as we continued talking. A guy with his phone to his ear, apparently a co-worker, stepped over and rapped sharply on the bar. I’d violated a rule. All customers, per the decree, are to sit at tables. This is part of the mandate that people are to maintain a one-meter distance from each other. Stefano said that if a policeman drove by and saw me drinking coffee at the counter, he could be fined several thousand euros. He also reported that city officials had been driving past with bullhorns, urging everybody to stay inside.
Yesterday, at the local supermarket, a man in a uniform…directed everyone to get a large…

When you live abroad Italy is that country that everyone knows. Everyone loves. Everyone has a story about. A son that got married there. A friend that had an amazing time in a city you never heard of.
Italy is the country that lights up people’s face. When they hear you are Italian, a smile appears on their face: “Ah, I-ta-li-anooo”, it’s the most common reaction. And then they start with their stories. Of all shape and type, but with always one thing in common: love. It seems like everyone abroad loves Italy. They love our food, our people, our sea, our mountains, our countryside, our cities, our clothes, our style, our hospitality, our culture, our football teams, our cars and motors, our actors and singers. And the list could go on and on.
In more than 3 years leaving abroad I cannot count how much love, stories and nice words I have heard about our country. I heard people saying: “Believe me, I’ve travelled most of the World by now: Italy is Italy, there’s nothing as unique and beautiful.”
Love doesn’t have an explanation, it’s love that explains things
Let’s start from here. From our culture, from our beauty and our history.
We are incredibly lucky, we just don’t see it — we are too close.

Italy — what a unique country! The landscapes, the food, and, more than anything else, a whole unique set of unspoken rules that no one ever bothers to explain. But don’t worry, there’s no need to panic!
In this article, I’ll give you five little secrets that I picked up from my time living in Rome. Try to embrace them, and you’ll navigate the Italian way of life without offending an entire nation. So enjoy, soak it in, and before you know it, you’ll live La Dolce Vita like a true local!
Italians don’t drink cappuccino after 11 am. They cringe at every tourist who dares to eat pizza with pineapple on top. Eating fish pasta with Parmigiano is considered a direct attack on every Italian and putting an ice cube into a wine glass is the fastest way to get arrested.
Ever heard of these things? Influencers have taken over the world and so have their over-exaggerated stereotypes of the Italians.
Italians are some of the friendliest and chill people in the world. They won’t make you slurp a carton of milk if you order a ‘Latte’ instead of a ‘Latte Macchiato’ on accident. They won’t take out some sort…

I recently came back from a three month working culinary tour of Italy where I fell truly, madly, deeply, in love with pasta. I am a young cook from Massachusetts and embarked on the journey to awaken my senses to the culinary center of the universe that is Italy (apologies to the French). After spending about a month in Florence, eating anything and everything I could get my hands on, I decided to spend the second month volunteering on a farm in the rural city of Città di Castello, about an hour and a half east of Florence. For one month I planted seeds, milked goats, mowed grass, and for the turning point…made pasta. I had made homemade pasta a handful of times before; my dad always made it around Christmas time and I had taken a class about it earlier in the trip. But for some reason, learning it here was completely different. I was taken to another planet when I was making pasta on the farm — it was a transcendental experience for me, if you will. I fell in love with the art of it and knew that I had to continue when I arrived back to the states.
Handcrafted pasta had taken hold of me and wasn’t letting go anytime soon. Here I am, a few months later, back in the states and it’s grip is stronger than ever — I recently opened an Italian inspired handcrafted pasta business, Allora Pasta Co. I use the recipe that I learned from the woman in Italy and take the same time, care, and love as I did then. I focus on carefully sourced ingredients — working with local farmers as much as possible to ensure a delicious, quality product you can feel good about eating and sharing with your loved ones.
While I can’t share my secret pasta recipe with you, I will share a few of my favorite sauces to go along with your pasta of choice. Whip up one of these bad boys, grab yourself a bag (or 5) of Allora, a bottle of Prosecco and you’ll be transported to a little caffe set upon cobble stone streets and beautiful churches in the center of Rome. To learn more about Allora Pasta Co. and my Italian adventures, visit www.allorapasta.com.
Aglio e olio (Garlic and Oil)
Italy’s most beloved sauce and a staple of Italian cooking, aglio e olio is simple to make but offers a complex flavor that will have any guest impressed by your skills.
6 tbsp and 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves of garlic, sliced thin
1/2 cup pasta water, mmm starchy = creamy
Red pepper flakes (if you like a little kick!)
Salt and pepper to taste
Make this recipe after the pasta has already been cooked and reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water. Add the garlic and 6 tablespoons of oil to a large, hot (this is important) pan. Add red pepper flakes for that little kick. Cook over medium heat until garlic is light brown. Transfer your fully cooked pasta and the pasta water to the pan, rev up that heat, and cook — continually stirring and tossing until a creamy sauce forms and coats all of the pasta. Remove from heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, stir well to combine.
Basil Almond Pesto
Deriving from Genoa, Italy, Pesto has been around for centuries. While this isn’t the exact ‘Italian recipe’ it is an adapted version I think you will find delectable to your taste buds.
2 cups packed fresh basil leaves
2 cloves of garlic
1/4 cup slivered almonds
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Combine basil, garlic, and almond in food processor and pulse until all is coarsely chopped. Slowly add the oil and process until fully incorporated and smooth. Transfer the mixture into a large mixing bowl and stir in the cheese. Salt and pepper until perfection!
Tuscan Ragú
Ah, ‘meat sauce.’ The perfect addition to any pasta dish. Turning a light snack into a hearty, wholly satisfying meal. Add the ingredients to a crock pot and simmer for a few hours to invite an even more complex flavor over for dinner.
1 cup stock of choice (veggie, chicken, or beef)
14oz ground beef
3.5oz ground pork, such as ground sausage
2 medium white onions
3 peeled tomatoes
1 celery stick
1 carrot
2 glasses of red wine, 1 to sip and 1 for the sauce 😉
1 cup of milk
Salt and pepper to taste
Add a drizzle of oil to a medium sized pot and brown the vegetables on a medium-high flame, add 1/2 cup of the stock to keep from burning. Season with salt and pepper. Once browned, add the meat and continue to brown. Add the wine (1 cup) and let it reduce and eventually evaporate. Stir in tomatoes and milk. Add more broth if necessary to avoid sticking. Cook on low flame for an hour or so — until all the meat is cooked through and the flavors have come together. Salt and pepper to taste.
All recipes have been adapted from ones I had learned during my time in Italy.

On March 25, the Heads of State and Government from Union member nations will be gathering at the Capitol in Rome, in the very same hall in which the Union came into being.
The commemoration of this anniversary entails undertaking a reflection on the process of European integration, which is all the more pressing given that, for the first time, a country — the United Kingdom, a member since 1973 — is leaving the Union.
medium.com
A first question is what was the situation in Europe and the circumstances in the world prior to the Treaties: whether they were simpler or more complex than today’s.
To begin with, the founders were driven by strong international instability characterized by a bipolar competition across-the-board.
With the exception of the Soviet Union, Europe emerged from World War II divided and weakened.
The demarcation line between the two superpowers ran right through the heart of the continent, sundering the continent in two for a long period of time.
A few years earlier, the Berlin Blockade and the Korean War had generated a tangible threat of a third world war. In 1955, it was only with great difficulty that the Austrian question was settled by resorting to a neutrality clause. An insurrection broke out in Algeria, after Tunisia and Morocco won their independence in 1956. That same year also saw the invasion of Hungary and the Suez Canal crisis. This marked the end of an era, with Europe’s powers disabused of any residual colonialist delusion.
This precarious set of circumstances meant that Europe was in need of a new outlook.
The Treaty for the Steel and Coal Community was signed in 1951, a year after the project for a European Defence Community, which however was shelved in France.
It was Italy that became the driving force, first through the 1955 Messina Conference, and then in 1956 with the Venice Conference, with Gaetano Martino, Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Segni government, at the lead.
Backed by democratic consensus in their home nations, the fathers of Europe who brought the Treaties into being were not visionaries but men of politics who, well aware of the challenges and risks they were facing, found a way to tackle them.
Men who had the courage to transform the weaknesses, vulnerabilities and anxieties of their respective populations into strengths, pooling together each country’s capabilities in the effort of building an open, overarching society in which liberty, democracy and cohesion would be mutually guaranteed.
The Europe we have come to know in these past few years has proved to be a vital tool for stability, safeguarding peace, economic growth and progress by advancing a rights- and civilization-based social model unequalled up to now.
Europe was gradually built by the joint effort of former enemies of the Second World War and later by the former adversaries in the “Cold War” who until a few years earlier, had belonged to alliances poised to battle for forty years.
If we look back at how far we have come, it is clear that the path has never been easy ever since the beginning.
If we look at the annals, we see that the path to integration has been complicated all along, starting with France’s “empty chair” policy in the mid-1960s.
Next came what German Foreign Affairs Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher would later define as “Eurosclerosis” during the 1970s, courageously overcome at the start of the following decade above all as a result of an Italian and German initiative.
Italian Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo spearheaded this drive, working alongside figures like German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the President of the French Republic, François Mitterrand and even US President Ronald Reagan.
The oil shock, soaring inflation, and mass unemployment were the most pressing problems to be tackled at that time, against an international backdrop marked by particularly strident clashes between the two blocs.
The impetus towards European unity has always been stronger than any entrenchment or overzealous temporary distinction pursued by individual governments or groups of countries, playing a significant role in fostering the evolution of international relations.
Indeed, the common needs underpinning a shared aspiration to ensure stability to the liberty and independence of European nations were pressing, starting with the six founding nations: France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.
Today, Europe seems to have almost turned in on itself. As aware as its leadership is of the steps that need to be taken, it remains hesitant when it comes to getting them underway.
As in the past, there is a need for forward-looking visions and an ability to embark on new and courageous paths.
A few figures illustrate this.
In 2000, the Union and its Member States produced 26.5% of the world’s Gross Domestic Product. By 2015, this percentage had slipped by as much as four points.
Over the last twenty years, the population of the entire European continent — also outside the Union’s borders — has remained more or less stable at around 750/800 million people. At the same time, Africa’s population, which today is around 1 billion, could double in just twenty-five years.
These two figures alone make it clear that Europe as a whole runs the risk of becoming a minor player on the international scenario, while across the world “giant” states continue to grow.
No European nation, on its own, can guarantee the effective independence of its decisions. Considering the dimension and scale of the issues, no return to old forms of national sovereignty can assure peace, security, well-being and prosperity to European citizens because no European nation alone will ever be able to stand on the international stage, expecting to influence events.
It is as true today as it was sixty years ago: we need a united Europe to serve our Continent’s needs for development and prosperity, which are indissolubly bound up with our collective capacity to make our voices heard on the world stage, asserting the values, identities and interests of our people.
In 1957 and even before, when founding fathers Adenauer, De Gasperi, Monnet, Schuman and Spaak conceived the first blueprint for integration, European identity was neither a matter of doubt or debate. There was no need to use abstract metaphors.
The grief, hunger, rubble, disease and existential angst caused by the two world wars — East to West, North to South — brought together millions of Europeans who, ever more insistently, asked their respective ruling classes “Why?”, followed by a resounding cry of “Never again!”.
The consequences of having betrayed the values of European civilization not once but twice over the course of a few years were clear and evident to all.
The founding fathers’ call to rally grew out of the memory that a Europe of openness, solidarity, art and science; a Europe of free thinking, tolerance and integration; and a Europe of trade needed to find its way again and this was something that could only be achieved together, uniting the resources and the future of the Continent’s nations and of its peoples.
The persistence of so many separate, sovereign European states appeared to them to be, in this sense, anachronistic, no less than had been the case in sixteenth-century Italy, when the country’s free communes and small principalities before the encroachment of powers like Spain and France.
Ten years earlier, on 29 July 1947, a few months after he was elected President of the Italian Republic, in this very chamber Luigi Einaudi announced that he would be voting in favour of the Peace Treaty in a speech that I quote to you now:
“In vain did sovereign states erect high customs barriers around themselves to maintain their own economic self-sufficiency. All that these barriers were good for was impoverishing their peoples, stirring them up against one another, prompting them to talk a strange and incomprehensible language about living space and geopolitical necessities, each one of them proclaiming exclusive excommunications against foreign immigrants, as if a population ferociously shrinking in on itself can generate wealth and power rather than misery and discontent.” He went on to add his hopes for a United States of Europe: “It is not a question of preaching. What matters is that the parliaments of the tiny states of which our divided Europe is made up renounce a portion of their sovereignty in favour of a parliament in which they are represented, a chamber elected directly by the peoples of Europe in unity, without distinction between one state and another and proportionate to their number of inhabitants, with individual states represented in the Chamber of States in equal number.”
In other words, what Einaudi was has been telling us for seventy years — and this remains true to this day — is that the true alternative to fragmentation and irrelevancy for each of these States is on the contrary a process of unification based not on the hegemony of the strongest but peaceful advancement through federal and democratic institutions (as also Altiero Spinelli sought), with equal rights and duties for all States, large and small, that freely decided to become members.
Indeed, one year earlier, Winston Churchill had expressed his hope for a structure to rebuild the family of European peoples and make it possible to live in peace, security and liberty: in his words, “a kind of United States of Europe”.
Over its sixty-year history, Europe has succeeded in keeping the key founding promise of its identity.
War has been banished and, for the first time since time immemorable, three successive generations have lived without experiencing such barbarity.
It took others to point this out. In 2012, to the amazement of some, a country that is not part of the Union awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union.
When bitter armed conflict closed in on the Union’s borders in the Balkan Peninsula, despite initial hesitation and indecision, Europe realized the importance of helping its neighbouring peoples to emerge from a crisis that seemed unsolvable.
The Union chose to offer these countries a political haven within the European framework. It is therefore a source of great satisfaction to see that Slovenia and Croatia are part of the Union today and that the other nations are moving along a path of gradual integration that Italy follows attentively, favours and encourages.
Nor should we forget the fact that being part of the Union helped Northern Ireland put an end to a long and bloody trail of violence.
Over the years, the European Union has embraced peoples and countries restored to liberty after a history of dictatorship: Greece, Portugal and Spain found safe anchorage for their futures within the European Community. They were followed by veterans of Soviet influence, nations that after 1989 became part of a Europe that until then had lacked the input of its Central and Eastern peoples and cultures.
The plurality of sensibilities, political positions and national traditions within the Union today have led some to question whether it is wise to move ahead rapidly along the path to enlargement.
And yet not even Europe can afford to postpone its rendezvous with history when it calls; nor may it surrender to separation and — much less — to amputation. On the contrary, we should be practising and enhancing mutual responsibility and solidarity in sharing benefits and burdens.
European identity is constituted by the ensemble of each of our cultural and historical heritages, alongside its heritage of shared principles developed jointly over the last few decades. What we must do now is look ahead and find the right tools to ensure that integration may continue.
These years of peace, well-being and prosperity in Europe have enabled us to achieve goals of which the founding fathers would, despite limitations and shortcomings, quite rightly be proud.
The many benefits for its citizens lie in Europe’s profile.
It is the thousands of domestic customs rules and regulations that have been abolished to enable the circulation of people and goods — something that is of great value to an exporting nation like Italy.
It is the Italian products that are arranged on supermarket shelves across European cities, as more than 60% of Italy’s exports go to Union nations.
It is the one hundred million tourists that every year, without needing a passport, move freely and unhindered across the Schengen Treaty area, many of them in Italy.
It is the millions of young people who study freely in European universities thanks to the Erasmus programme.
It is the common currency which, in a short space of time, has become the world’s second most important reserve currency. As a result of European Central Bank policy, the euro has significantly brought down credit costs, safeguarding the savings of enterprises and households alike.
It is the improved environmental protection standards in our cities. It is the development of renewables and the reduction in harmful gas emissions. It is the thousands of protected areas that safeguard our quality of life.
It is the certified safety of food that protects our health, guaranteed by the traceability of the foods consumed in Europe.
It is the safety of our children’s toys.
It is the thousands of patents awarded European-wide protection.
It is the trade agreements that regulate and guarantee relations with other nations.
It is the greater security offered through the prospect of a common defence policy, recently placed back on the agenda.
It is the internal protection of our social model.
It is the Charter of Nice ensuring the fundamental rights of Union citizens.
Overturning the expression attributed to Massimo d’Azeglio, we might say: “Now that we have made Europeans, it is time to make Europe”.
Indeed it is the people, especially young people, who already live the experience of this Europe, and who are the guarantors of the irreversibility of European integration. The Union must direct its attention and efforts towards them.
The hallmarks of European civilization are our values of individual and collective freedom, tolerance towards others’ choices, and an openness to ways of thinking that come from other contexts, without abdicating compliance with local laws and traditions. Albeit with delays and shortcomings, these values have spread and asserted themselves far beyond Europe’s borders, helping to build an order in which the concepts of solidarity, mutual support among the different levels on which our societies are structured, and harmony between the public and private sectors to reduce major social scourges, are strong and distinctive characteristics of what Europe is.
Solutions to the sovereign debt crisis and the economic slowdown cannot entail a curtailment of social rights within member states. Nor are they an excuse for coarse definitions of Northern and Southern Europe.
This is the soul of our Europe. This is our identity.
If we want a stronger European Union, this is where we must start.
Every time, individually or collectively, that we have forgotten this inspirational thrust, perhaps unconsciously we have helped turn a major political undertaking into a technical and bureaucratic programme with which the citizens of Europe have sometimes found it difficult to identify.
The economic and financial downturn has shaken the social fabric of our nations, while at our gates, wide-ranging instability and epochal historical events — migration for one — have undermined Europe’s capacity to meet the expectations of its citizens.
The challenges to which the European Union must rise, above and beyond financial and migration-related issues, the Union’s Eastern and Mediterranean borders, and terrorist campaigns, once again highlight the need to rise to the challenge of reforming the Treaties. This is unavoidable, as is pointed out in the Report by the Committee of Wise Men presented recently to the President of the Chamber of Deputies.
The ambitions of the Treaty of Lisbon, today in force, appear ill-suited to the nature and breadth of these challenges, and to the pursuit of the goal of achieving ever-closer continental integration.
Building the future requires Italy and Europe to contribute every available resource, an extraordinary unity of intent and a robust faith in the founding values of the process of integration.
What we need is not a non-impossible return to a past that no longer exists nor walls that merely push the problems onto others without resolving them, but solidarity between nations, solidarity across the generations and solidarity among citizens who share the same civilization.
When a newly free and democratic Italy was taking its first steps as a Republic, De Gasperi said, “To stay the course we must draw on the reconstructive and unifying energies of all Europe. All we can do, in order to counter the march of instinctual and irrational forces, is to call on our common civilization: the solidarity of reason and a sense of liberty and justice.”
Now more than ever, we must make these words our own.
*Excerpts from President Mattarella’s speech to the Italian Parliament on March 22, 2017.

Italy, a country renowned for its rich history, breathtaking landscapes, and delectable cuisine, carries with it several nicknames that reflect its unique identity. These monikers capture the essence of the nation and the various aspects that make it special. In this article, we will explore Italy’s most popular nicknames, their meanings, and what they signify about this beautiful country.
One of Italy’s most famous nicknames is “Bel Paese,” which translates to “Beautiful Country” in English. This nickname encapsulates Italy’s extraordinary natural beauty, encompassing everything from its picturesque countryside, rolling hills, and stunning coastal regions to its historic cities filled with architectural marvels.
The name “Bel Paese” is frequently used in art and literature to describe the aesthetic beauty of Italy. It represents Italy’s legacy of art and culture, where countless artists, musicians, and writers have drawn inspiration. From the scenic landscapes of Tuscany to the grandeur of Venice, it is no surprise that Italy is celebrated for its beauty.
Italy is often colloquially referred to as the “Boot” due to its distinctive shape resembling a high-heeled boot on the map. This playful nickname is used mainly in informal contexts and reflects the country’s geographical layout.
The “Boot” concept adds an element of charm to discussing Italy and is often used to help depict the different regions of the country. For example, the “toe” of the boot refers to Calabria, while the “heel” pertains to Apulia. This geographical representation enables both Italians and visitors to understand the country’s diverse geographical and cultural landscape better.
Another popular nickname that resonates with many people is “La Dolce Vita,” which translates to “The Sweet Life.” This phrase became particularly famous after the release of Federico Fellini’s 1960 film of the same name. The essence of “La Dolce Vita” captures the Italian spirit of enjoying life’s pleasures, from delicious food and wine to beautiful art and architecture.
Italy’s rich culinary tradition, full of regional specialties, delightful desserts, and world-famous wines, epitomizes this philosophy. Italians celebrate family gatherings, socializing over meals, and savoring life’s simple pleasures — an approach to life that many associate with the Italian way of living.
While not a nickname in the traditional sense, it is essential to note that the very name “Italia” carries immense historical significance. The term “Italia” originally referred to a specific region in Southern Italy and has roots dating back to the ancient Greeks. Over the centuries, the name expanded to encompass the entire country after the unification of Italy in the 19th century.
The name is derived from the ancient Italic tribes that settled in the region. Today, “Italia” is a source of pride for Italians and an integral part of the country’s identity. It represents the nation’s long history, rich cultural heritage, and diverse regional influences.
Italy is also often referred to as “The Land of the Popes” due to its historical and religious significance. With over 1,800 years of papal history, Rome is home to the Vatican City — the smallest independent state in the world and the spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church.
This nickname highlights Italy’s important role in the history of Christianity and its influence on global religious practices. Not only does it identify Italy with a significant aspect of its culture, but it also attracts millions of tourists annually who visit the Vatican to see treasures like St. Peter’s Basilica and the Sistine Chapel.
Italy is famously known as “The Cradle of the Renaissance,” a nickname that captures its historical importance as the birthplace of one of the most significant cultural movements in European history. The Renaissance, which occurred from the 14th to the 17th century, marked a period of rejuvenation in art, science, and thought, leading to monumental changes in society.
Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome were pivotal in showcasing revolutionary ideas and artistic achievements. Renowned artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael emerged during this time, and their works continue to be celebrated worldwide. The nickname reminds us of Italy’s enduring legacy as a cultural powerhouse.
Italy is known by several nicknames, including “Bel Paese” (Beautiful Country), “The Boot,” “La Dolce Vita” (The Sweet Life), “The Land of the Popes,” and “The Cradle of the Renaissance.”
Italy is colloquially referred to as the “Boot” because of its distinctive geographical shape that resembles a high-heeled boot on the world map. This nickname is useful for identifying different regions of the country, like referring to the “toe” or “heel.”
“La Dolce Vita” translates to “The Sweet Life,” reflecting the Italian ethos of savoring life’s pleasures, including food, art, and company. It symbolizes the relaxed and joyful approach to life that many associate with Italian culture.
Italy earned this nickname due to its significant role in the Renaissance, a period of cultural rebirth that began in the 14th century. Notable cities like Florence and artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo emerged during this transformative era, leading to lasting contributions in art, philosophy, and science.
The name “Italia” has historical roots, originating from ancient Italic tribes. It has since become a source of national pride and represents the country’s cultural heritage and diversity stemming from thousands of years of history.
Italy’s nicknames encapsulate the nation’s beauty, culture, and historical significance. From “Bel Paese” to “La Dolce Vita,” these monikers highlight the unique aspects of Italian life and the enduring impact that Italy has had on art, cuisine, and religion across the world. The richness of Italy’s nicknames is a testament to its profound influence over the centuries, drawing visitors from all around the globe to experience the magic of this remarkable country.

The alarm clock goes off at 7:00am. I immediately do my morning stretches before going for my habitual morning run, a few kilometers traversing the narrow, winding streets of Cinque Vie and around the Castello Sforzesco. After, either a bowl of whole-grain cereal mixed with bananas and strawberries and Turkish coffee. If I’m feeling extra Italian, a brioches al pistacchio topped off with a warm cup of cappuccino at the corner café. Then I’m off to work at my office located in the historic 14th century Palazzo Borromeo. Lunches would consist of either a plate of pasta or a protein-based dish, to be had on the fashionable piazza just in front of my office with a view of a 16th century church. In the evening, a drink or two at my favorite lounge at the Darsena neighborhood. Had it been Fashion Week or Design Week, a quick pit-stop at an after party or at a gallery opening before heading home to get a peaceful night’s rest.
This was how some of my days looked like in Milan, the city I called home for nearly a decade. I had moved to this bustling metropolis at the tender age of seventeen to study at university. With dreams as vast as the endless cityscape before me, I embarked on a voyage of self-discovery, leaving behind the familiar comforts of my hometown of Jakarta.
The streets of Milan hummed with the promise of adventure, each corner whispering secrets waiting to be uncovered. Amidst the towering skyscrapers and labyrinthine cobblestone alleyways, I found myself at the cusp of adulthood, navigating the intricate tapestry of urban life with a blend of trepidation and exhilaration. With every step, I wove my own narrative into the fabric of the city, carving out a place for myself amidst the chaos and possibility. And so, the saga of my odyssey began, a tale of resilience, growth, and the boundless potential of a longing to succeed.
This journey had not been without its lows. Finding myself in the midst of an international crowd had made it difficult to learn the local language, especially during my initial years in Milan. It was only when I started to join the workforce that the melody of the language began to spark a note within me. What had initially been thinking twice and endlessly practicing under my breath before going into a café to order an espresso eventually became second nature. Over the years, I had become a fixture at these cafés; the staff need not ask what I would like to order anymore, they simply bring me il solito, the usual. I am, after all, a creature of habit.
I owe much of my relative prowess in the language to my friends and colleagues, who patiently endured my stumbling attempts at conjugations. Their encouragement, coupled with countless laughs at my linguistic missteps, transformed my rudimentary grasp of Italian into something more coherent. Granted, they didn’t teach me to speak Italian; they taught me to speak Milanese, which is what some Italians regard as a refined blend of English and Italian generally spoken by overachieving business people and stylish fashion enthusiasts in the nation’s financial capital.
Covered in an abundance of arts and culture, my life in Milan had been rather colorful. I had the remarkable opportunity to come across people from diverse backgrounds, eat marvelous food, and travel relentlessly. However, it had not always been easy. When the pandemic hit at the onset of this decade, like many other young people starting off in their careers, I had struggled to cope with the stringent restrictions. I was fortunate enough to be living with two extraordinary people who respectively hailed from Spain and Sicily, who undoubtedly made my time in quarantine worthwhile. We would sit for hours over home-made Sicilian cuisine sharing stories about our lives prior to coming to Milan. As the sun-kissed Mediterranean flavors danced in our palates, we all felt extremely connected through the commonalities we had discovered in the stories we shared. Naturally, we all kept in touch after we went our separate ways, the Spaniard to Emilia Romagna and the Sicilian to her native island. She would sometimes send me the quintessential pacco da giù, a package usually sent by madres and nonnas of the South to their children and grandchildren in the North. She would fill these pacchi with paste di mandorla, my favorite Sicilian dessert after cannoli.
Among the bustling piazzas of the city, there lay a treasure trove of museums, each a sanctuary for treasured paintings and sculptures. These cultural havens became my beloved retreats, and further fueled my interest for the arts. I often find myself gazing at Francesco Hayez’s Il bacio, the masterpiece on display towards the end of the Pinacoteca di Brera, for prolonged periods of time. Michelangelo’s statue of David commands attention from its prominent position at the heart of the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence, about a two-hour train ride from Milan. I stood transfixed, drawn into the intricate details of this renowned sculpture. Florence offered more than its artistic treasures; as I wondered through its enchanting streets, I was greeted by breathtaking views of the Arno river and the red-tiled rooftops that stretched out before me. I indulged in copious amounts of Tuscan bread, each bite a revelation. Renowned for its lack of salt, it seemed to sing with the flavors of the region, a perfect complement to the rich olive oil and robust wines.
Having lived in one of the most prominent fashion capitals of the world, it would come to no surprise that I had made a great deal of friends that are somehow intertwined with the realm of haute couture. My interactions with them made me somewhat of an expert on the topic. Although I do struggle differentiating between cerulean and other shades of blue, I have learnt enough to know that my favorite fashion show is Alexander McQueen’s Ready-to-Wear Spring ’98; that Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace had a heated rivalry throughout the late twentieth century; and that Tom Ford had initially worked at Gucci before starting his eponymous brand.
Although Milan was beautiful in its own right during the day, it was the nights where the lion awakens in its den. A cocktail da asporto in hand listening to L’appuntamento by the majestic Ornella Vanoni, whilst casually staring at the latest pieces of high fashion embossed in fluorescent light at Via Montenapoleone. Those were the days.
Nestled in the heart of Lombardy, Milan offered a gateway to mountains, lakes, and beaches. This geographical blessing meant that adventures were never far away. During the sun-soaked summers, my best friend and I would embark on journeys to the charming coastal towns of Liguria in his sky blue vintage sedan listening to Italian hits from the ’80s. The salty breeze mingled with the nostalgia of the music, creating a soundtrack to our youthful escapades. As the seasons shifted and snow dusted the peaks, our attention turned to the Italian Alps. Bundled up in our warmest gear, we’d venture into the snowy expanse, eager to carve fresh tracks on the slopes. The thrill of skiing down those majestic mountains was unmatched, each run a new adventure waiting to be discovered.
Milan, with its strategic location at the heart of three international airports, was more than just a city; it was a launchpad to adventures far beyond its borders. International travel became a routine part of life. Den Haag to attend my sister’s birthday dinner? Easy. Frankfurt for my best friend’s wedding? Just another weekend trip. Athens for a bachelor’s party? Been there, done that. London to visit my uncle? A frequent flyer. From the cobblestone streets of Den Haag to the vibrant markets of Athens, each destination held its own allure and charm. Yet, no matter how far I traveled, Milan remained my anchor, always welcoming me back with open arms. It wasn’t just a city; it was the starting point for countless journeys, each one leaving an indelible mark on my soul. And for that, Milan will always hold a special place in my heart.
Navigating the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy was a trial by fire, one that tested my patience and resolve in ways I never imagined. The infamous Italian red tape was a beast of its own, one that many expats struggled to tame. I was lucky enough to emerge relatively unscathed, but I witnessed the battles of others who weren’t as fortunate. I quickly learned that trying to fight the system was like banging my head against a brick wall — painful and ultimately futile. So, I did what any survivor in Italy does: I adapted. One of my greatest accomplishments was obtaining my driver’s license in Italy. Months of grappling with specific terminology and enduring compulsory driving lessons, all conducted in Italian, were no small feat. If there is one way to master the art of driving, it is by maneuvering through the narrow streets of Milan while receiving colorful scolding in Italian from your instructor as you deftly dodge a Fiat 500 driven by a formidable nonna.
As my time in Milan drew to a close, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness at the thought of leaving behind spontaneous adventures. No more day trips to the serene beauty of Lago di Como or the romantic allure of Verona. But as I packed my bags, I knew that the memories of those carefree days exploring the wonders of Il Bel Paese would stay with me forever.
Italy became not just a destination but a journey of self-discovery, marking the beginning of my solo adventures in a foreign land. It was my first taste of independence, a chapter in my life where I learned to stand on my own two feet. I couldn’t claim to have made it solely on my own. Behind every step I took were the unwavering support and love of my family, friends, and colleagues. Their encouragement and guidance were the pillars that held me up during moments of doubt and uncertainty. Yet, Italy represented more than just a physical location. It was a decade-long odyssey, a tapestry woven with the threads of newfound friendships and unforgettable experiences.
Living away from my family and the friends I grew up with was a challenge, but it was also an opportunity to create a life enriched by the presence of beautiful souls who became like a second family to me. They shared in my triumphs and failures, my joys and sorrows, shaping the person I was becoming. As I reflect on my time in Italy, I realize that it wasn’t just about navigating a new country; it was about navigating the depths of my own soul. And in doing so, I discovered a strength and resilience I never knew I possessed. This country had taught me a great deal of things. But it is now time to say good-bye.
Arrivederci, Italia. Until we meet again.

Hey friend, congrats on getting married! The ceremony was absolutely beautiful. The church was so charming — though of course, not as breathtaking as the Sistine Chapel, where I went, by the way, when I studied abroad in Italy. Did I ever tell you about that?
My compliments to your caterers — the dinner was delicious. I loved your cute American lasagna buffet, but it’s just too bad you couldn’t serve authentic osso buco or cacio e pepe, which I ordered (and took pictures of for Insta) all the time when I lived among the locals in Napoli — or Naples, to non-Italians. Delicious cake, too — so adorable that it’s from a local award-winning bakery, which reminds me of this tiny rustic corner pasticceria I visited every day for tiramisu — or tiramisu, to non-Italians.
Speaking of Italy, you should have been there the first time I tried spaghetti al nero di seppia. Well, before the part where I spit it out after learning it was made from squid ink, then asked for chicky parm instead. Actually, most of the time I ate these fantastic simple buttery noodles from a part of the menu called bambinos, which in Italian likely means something like “very autentico adventuroso eaters.”

“Today we celebrate the sustained excellent results of an agreement signed 15 years ago which marked the start of an intense collaboration between Italy and the US in tracking down hundreds of illicitly exported artworks,” said Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities Alberto Bonisoli in his remarks during a ceremony at the Embassy of Italy in Washington DC for the presentation of the catalog Saving Art Preserving Heritage.
“What we are seeing here is a small part of the results of that cooperation, but no less significant in that they exemplify the shared culture that unites Italy and the US,” he added.
Remarks were followed by the Repatriation Ceremony of three artifacts and by an exhibition of 20 works of art recovered in the last two years by the Carabinieri Heritage Protection Unit in collaboration with the FBI and ICE.
The importance of the event, hosted by the Italian Ambassador to the US Armando Varricchio at the presence of Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities Alberto Bonisoli and General Fabrizio Parrulli, head of the Carabinieri Heritage Protection Unit, goes beyond the catalog that was presented and what it represents — the work done by so many to preserve Italian art and antiquities for the benefit of the Republic and the global community.
Indeed, cultural heritage itself is the foundation to our global society. We see cultural heritage — art, monuments, archives — as something greater than ourselves; a reflection of our past collective identities and a legacy we wish to see survive for future generations. This survival is especially important given the vital role of heritage in crafting memories and preserving histories.
“The pillage, looting, destruction, illicit trafficking of cultural heritage, be it Roman coins, ancient illuminated pages or precious and unique works like the mosaic floor on display tonight, is a wound in the flesh of humankind,” said Ambassador Varricchio in his welcoming remarks. “Like all wounds, it will not heal, without leaving a scar. A scar in our ability to understand past civilizations and past cultures, a dent in our capacity to shed light on the incredible human journey that defines who we are today. By losing the past, we blur our present and obfuscate our future.”
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Italy, a country with a rich past, has put the preservation of cultural heritage at the top of its agenda both domestically and internationally.
The issue is crucial also for the US, which was represented by the top cultural and enforcement officials of the Administration, including U.S. Department of State Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs Marie Royce, US Department of Homeland Security Deputy Executive Associate Director Alysa Erichs, and FBI Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division Robert Johnson.
The volume presented during the event marks over 15 years of cooperation between Italy and the US to protect and preserve Italian art, antiquities, and cultural objects, made possible by a bilateral cultural property agreement that outlined steps both countries can take to combat the trafficking in Italian cultural objects. The catalog collects more than 200 recovered artifacts.
The successes we have achieved are predicated not just on the determination of the Italian Government but also on the effective cooperation we have with our partners and friends across the globe and in particular the United States.
Artistic heritage is not just a system of “artifacts” which preserves the vestiges of styles, eras, and images of bygone human history. It is also the eternally present metaphor of a past that returns in its “distance closeness” and in the enduring oxymoron of a historical becoming that, by travelling backwards, projects itself into the present and future.
For example, a painting from the 14th or 17th century opens a window on the past, but the image we see beyond the shutter is very real to our eyes. Art comes to life when we look at it and takes us back to the very same lines that the artist drew centuries before. The same is true of archaeological artifacts.
Our century finds a market for everything, and where there’s money, there’s crime. Thus the commingling in this sector of organized crime, professional thieves, adventurers, merchants, and unscrupulous gallery managers, auction houses and museums is increasingly common. Behind the criminality of this trafficking is the real loss to humanity.
The ultimate result is the irretrievable loss of historical information.
The challenge to combat art trafficking globally, and especially in Italy, is even more pressing when juxtaposed with the Republic’s peerless cultural heritage. There are more UNESCO World Heritage Sites (54 in total) in Italy than in any other nation.
Italy and the United States have met this challenge through our agreement, which uses both legal and social measures to discourage looting and increase legal access to Italian cultural heritage.
The agreement is re-evaluated every five years in order to adapt to a constantly changing world with increasingly “expert” traffickers and shifting priorities.

“Ciao, un caffè, per favore.” That’s how every morning started during my last holiday in Italy. Typically, these mornings I spent in small cafés, filled with the buzz of loud voices and the clink of espresso cups. These cafés made you feel at home with warm sunlight streaming through the glass windows and the fine aroma of coffee delicately wrapping around you. Among tanned locals, you order a tiny espresso cup with a glass of water, just like a typical Italian. Hot, bitter coffee runs through your veins, you place the cup back on the bar counter, put on your sunglasses, and then disappear into the narrow streets…
How did I get there? After an amazing lunch with pizza, my friend and I decided to spend a couple of weeks in Italy, visiting the most iconic cities and eating authentic Italian pizza, something we had always dreamt of doing. After researching, we chose four destinations: Florence, Rome, the Cinque Terre National Park, and Genoa. We booked Airbnb flats, packed small suitcases, and embarked on our greatest adventure to the land of sun, pizza, coffee, and delicious gelato.
An unusually bright and hot sun greeted us when we arrived in Florence. Though we were exhausted from the journey, we decided to take a short walk to the city center. We were staying quite close, on the opposite bank of the Arno river. The weather was perfect for a summer evening: warm, but with a light breeze.
Our first stop was Florence’s famous cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. The construction of this magnificent Renaissance dome began at the end of the 13th century. The vast Gothic structure is striking, with its front decoration showcasing an incredible mix of pink, white, and green marble. Due to circumstances, we couldn’t go inside, so we peered into the marvelous interior through the open door.
Next, we visited the less famous but charming church, Santa Croce. I have a special connection with this place. As a child, I visited Florence with my mum. Once, in a funny and somewhat scary moment, we nearly got lost and missed our group. We had to rush across the Santa Croce Square to meet our guide. It was our first trip abroad, and we were a little scared of getting lost in a city we’d never been to before. Fourteen years later, as an adult, I stood in front of that beautiful church, smiling at my childhood memories. I was surprised at how different things looked after so many years. The square in front of the church wasn’t as huge as I remembered it being as a child.
Then we went to the Roman crossing, the Ponte Vecchio, or Old Bridge. Since the 13th century, there have been shops lining the road across the bridge. In the evening, it becomes full of street musicians and couples. Ponte Vecchio is a very romantic spot in Florence, with its great views over the river and of the bridge itself. We arrived just as the sun was setting, and its pink and brown shops started to gleam gold, reflecting in the calm water. On the other side of the river, there were tiny identical cottages with pollards. Followed by the deep red-purple sunset, we sat down on the dry, rough grass and cooled ourselves with tasty gelato. While enjoying the amazing flavors, two police officers came to warn us about insects in the grass that could bite us. They didn’t speak English well but heartily tried to convey their message. In the end, they smiled and waved to us before moving on to another group of people.
After two full days in Florence, having walked over 30 kilometers each day, my friend stayed to rest in the city while I decided to visit Siena. What seemed like a casual trip to a nearby city turned into a wonderful adventure. I didn’t expect anything special and was pleasantly surprised.
Siena is a small city in the heart of the Tuscany region. The first thing I encountered was the Medici Fortress on my way from the railway station to the city center. The massive yellow stone building caught my attention with its high fortress walls. I guessed there might be nice views from the top, and I was right. It was afternoon, and from the top, I saw a magical skyline, a clear blue sky with thin white clouds, and wide verdant hills in shades of green. Then, I entered the old city. Its narrow streets led me into a labyrinth of yellow and red stone buildings that protected me from the hot Tuscan sun. A welcome coolness covered my shoulders and made me shiver a bit. I didn’t have a map, so I followed the signs on buildings and asked people for directions. The signs led me to the stunning Piazza del Campo, with its massive Palazzo Comunale and Torre del Mangia in the center of the town. The square was full of people, cafes, noise, and street vendors. There wasn’t enough space for all the tourists. I walked a few steps up from the square and faced the magnificent Duomo, which dominates Siena’s city center. It wasn’t as big as Florence’s Duomo but still very impressive. That day, I returned to the hotel very tired. Going up and down the hills was more exhausting than usual walking.
Rome, where history intertwines with modernity, is a place of contrasts, both noisy and peaceful.
An ancient city with a vast historical heritage, Rome impresses you from the first steps. I’m not referring to the arrival by train, as the railway station, while not the ugliest or dirtiest I’ve seen, is still somewhat unpleasant. After the relative calm of Florence, Rome overwhelms you with its noise and crowds. Initially, I thought the city itself would be less crowded than the railway station, but I was mistaken. Wherever you go, Rome is packed with people in June.
The district where we found an Airbnb flat was far from the city center and didn’t seem particularly safe at first glance, with many migrants and poorly dressed individuals. However, it didn’t feel like a rough part of town, and we didn’t encounter any problems. So, we left our bags and ran to explore the city.
As I mentioned before, I visited Italy fourteen years ago, including Florence, Rome, and a few small cities. I had dreamt of returning as an adult to not only see and remember everything but to truly experience it. Italy is all about the gesticulating Italians, the smell of pizza and coffee from every corner, enjoying your dinner with pasta and wine in small cafés with lovely views, and soaking in the special atmosphere that is unique to this country.
We planned to see the most famous sights like the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and the Vatican. We marked these spots on the map and decided to walk through the beautiful old streets rather than use public transport. We also didn’t plan where to eat, leaving it to chance, which added a spontaneous and adventurous spirit to our journey.
Compared to other Italian cities, Rome feels very big and noisy. I suppose it was peak tourist season, so we were a bit unlucky in that regard. Near all the major attractions, you constantly hear street vendors calling out “Cold water — 1 euro” or “Hat, buy a hat.” You simply want to enjoy the view and take photos, but it’s almost impossible due to the crowds and the persistent sellers.
We did a quick loop around the Colosseum, hurried by a strong, sandstorm-like wind. We delved into the labyrinth of streets and found another Roman gem — the Trevi Fountain, the largest Baroque fountain in the city and the most famous in the world. Unfortunately, the situation was the same there. The small square was overcrowded with tourists, making it difficult to get close to the fountain. We decided to return early the next morning, hoping it would be less crowded.
The next day, we woke up very early and by 6 a.m., we were already at the Trevi Fountain. The atmosphere was completely different from the previous day. The fresh morning air was much more pleasant than the scorching day heat. There were only a few tourists around, allowing us to enjoy the view. This was the perfect time to walk around the city and appreciate its ancient masterpieces. We had enough time to admire the gorgeous statues and throw a coin for luck into the blue water while the statue of God Oceanus watched us attentively. Bathed in the soft light of sunrise, we moved on to the Spanish Steps.
The Spanish Steps connect the Piazza di Spagna at the base with Piazza Trinità dei Monti, dominated by the Trinità dei Monti church at the top. The marble steps, polished by thousands of feet, shone in the bright sun. Lazy, yawning tourists began to appear, and we even saw several weddings having photo sessions on the steps.
We continued our walk and arrived at the Quattro Fontane square, an ensemble of four Late Renaissance fountains installed in the 16th century at the intersection of Via delle Quattro Fontane and Via del Quirinale. The morning sun was starting to bring its summer warmth, and we chose the shady side of the road as we headed toward the Vatican.
The Vatican hardly needs an introduction. There’s plenty of information available in any guidebook, but I advise you to plan your visit carefully. Be aware of Catholic holidays and check the opening hours of St. Peter’s Basilica.
Standing in front of one of the largest churches in the world, I remembered an episode from my childhood. When I first visited with my mom, it was nearly dark. Yellow lamps cast a warm glow over the square. Our driver, who didn’t speak English well, tried to tell me something in Italian. Finally, he pointed to the Apostolic Palace and said, “Papa. Roma. Window.” It was the most memorable moment of that trip. Though I enjoyed the old buildings and their significant history, I couldn’t fully appreciate them as a child. However, that summer night, standing near the native who proudly showed me the Pope’s window, I felt something incredible. As an ordinary girl, I was standing just meters from the head of the Catholic Church and the Vatican, whom I’d only seen on television. It felt almost magical. As an adult, I felt the same childlike wonder when we returned. I showed my friend that window with a warm smile, remembering the Italian driver.
After a busy day of walking, we moved to the most beautiful and colorful area of Rome — Trastevere, which feels like a different city. After ancient forums, ruins, and historical sites, there isn’t as much to see, but the atmosphere is entirely different.
The busy city blurs in the dim sunlight as we step into the Trastevere area. Its narrow cobblestone streets are picturesque, lined with ochre-colored buildings entwined with bushy green plants, arched passageways, and old doorways with antique door knockers. Don’t miss this atmospheric place. My friend from Rome recommended a café known for its famous pasta — tonnarelli. Although there was a long queue for a table, it was worth the wait. The outdoor tables, warm yellow lights, loud emotional Italians, and delicious food created a recipe for small happiness.
We finished our pasta late in the evening and took a walk around the city. It had completely transformed. The day’s heat had given way to a fresh breeze. Tourists had disappeared from the streets. Bright day colors had faded, replaced by ochre and dark brown hues under the cozy yellow street lamps. Magic was in the air, filling us with complete happiness.
The next day, we left Rome. It will always hold a special place in my heart. Rome is where treasures can be found around every corner, and even the most unassuming streets hold incredible history. You just need to ease your mind and enjoy the city, where history intertwines with reality in a quaint way.

After the problems with my passport finally subsided (not so funny story: it was expired and I had to leave the country to renew it, but couldn’t leave the country with an expired passport), my family decided it was time to venture out further than our usual trips from northern to southern California and organize our first visit to Europe. The planning process was strenuous as each of us tried to melt our ideas of the perfect adventure together, but looking back I could not be happier with how it played out. One of the most memorable experiences, in fact, was our two-day deviation from the mainstream: Quercianella.
Rather than hitting every crowded tourist destination in Italy, we rented a car in Florence and drove down the Tuscany coast, stopping first at Sienna, and then ending at a miniature beach town by the name of Quercianella.
A town where you could count the number of restaurants on your hands, and every resident was likely on a first-name basis, this was the epitome of an escape. The air smelled of salt and the temperature was perfectly warm. Every one there seemed care-free — families walked freely on the sides of the road, shop owners sipped coffee outside, and you could see locals laying on the stretches of rock and beach basking in the sun and purely enjoying the company of friends or a good book.
After driving down the town’s narrow roads for a while, we found our “Villa Margherita” and unpacked starved, ready to uncover the local wonders. Being a Yelp-connoisseur, I offered to scour the food scene, but soon realized that Yelp did not carry much weight in this little town. So, we slipped on our sandals and just began to walk. After following the main road for a few minutes, we turned onto a street with a gelateria on the corner, and quickly found a pizzeria nearby.
We sat outside on a string-lit patio and soon began speaking with the waiter, who also happened to be the owner’s son. In contrast to the people working the service desk at the hotel, with whom we had to communicate through vague hand gestures, he spoke a great amount of English. It was a comforting revelation, since the town probably did not get many tourists coming from the US. So, taking advantage, my dad asked for dish recommendations. He told us to get a pizza each, as they were personal-sized and he could easily finish one or two. We probably should have known that his idea of personal would differ than ours, however, and when he brought them to the table, all my sister said was “it’s almost bigger than me!” I wasn’t complaining though; we ended up taking the leftovers for a late-night snack.
At the end of our delicious meal, we were greeted by another unexpected surprise. We began talking to the owner and his son about where we were from (Palo Alto, California), and the son’s face suddenly lit up. It turned out he had lived a couple miles away from us for ten years while working his past job, after which he decided to take some time to move back home and work with his father. Our meal then turned into a night of laughs and good conversation as we exchanged stories of California and got to know the family of the pizzeria.
Even in a seemingly random beach town, we found a connection to our home thousands of miles away. The unexpected link was a reminder that we live in a minuscule world where the owner of a pizza place you happen to stumble on in Tuscany could very well have once been your neighbor.

When I travel alone, I am the complete opposite of someone who obsessively plans every part of their journey. I obsessively try to avoid planning as much as humanly possible until the absolute last minute when I need to figure out what I’m supposed to do before my flight back home.
Back in Autumn 2023, during a month in Puglia, I suddenly felt I’d spent enough time eating focaccia in Bari, and decided to visit the coast of Salento, specifically a charming beachside town called Gallipoli. A few hours by local train later, passing through rolling hills and small charming Apuglian towns, I was there.
I walked around the historical center, ate pizza, and enjoyed the perfect weather and view of the beautiful Ionian Sea. None of my pictures do the place justice, especially considering I went to the beach without a camera or phone (since I went alone), so I was unable to capture the most magical sunset I have ever seen in my life — as the sun hit the horizon, a lone tree on a small island acted like the iris in a…

Seated backward on a high-speed TGV approaching the 8.5-mile-long Mont Cenis tunnel, I unwrapped a piece of Tome des Bauges I had purchased hours earlier at Chambéry’s Marché Des Halles.
Next to it on my tray table, I had a tiny baguette, given to me free at La Panière, just outside the Marché. Thankfully, the bistro on board offered wooden cutlery so that I could cut the rind.
I was even more grateful that the bistro sold a crisp Pays d’Oc chardonnay to accompany my 11 am snack.
This grassy, somewhat stinky cheese would be my last taste of the French Alps on this trip.
I would soon enter a tunnel that would take me under 6,000 feet of rock — pushed upward by tectonic collisions 30 million years ago — and when I emerged, I would be in Italy

GOSPEL songs — earworms! — play in my head constantly now after two intense weeks of learning them with a choir touring Tuscany. We weren’t a choir before we boarded our respective flights, but we are a choir now.
And right now I can ‘hear’ a very beautiful Italian prayer-song, Signore Delle Cime — Lord of the [mountain] Peaks — in my mind and I, a non-believer, am nevertheless deeply moved. Who wouldn’t be?
Signore Delle Cime asks the Lord to take ‘our friend’, a fallen mountaineer, up to heaven covered ‘with a soft white blanket’. It soars.
Then there was Bella Ciao, the rousing hymn of the partisans who would die for la liberta. It seems all Italians know that one.
The 30 singers in our choir are mostly Australian and we also have a sassy soprano from Canada who lives in New Zealand, three terrific tenors (Scotland, Canada and New Zealand), and an Irish lass, our scintillating soloist and queen of the altos, who lives in Melbourne.
We learned songs, mostly gospel in nature, in Italian, French, Samoan, Zulu (yes!) and English. And we performed a selection of them in two churches, one in the gentle medieval town of Mercatello sul Metauro in the Marche region that borders Tuscany, and another in Firenze. (The angelic altos are pictured above.)
Our maestros were exceptional talents — Guerrino Parri in Mercatello, Edoardo Materassi who taught us in the first week of our tour in Montestigliano, near Siena, and in Firenze, and Tony Backhouse, who taught us for the entire two weeks. Many readers will know Tony from his acclaimed Sydney-based choir, the Café at the Gates of Salvation Gospel Choir, as well as his Heavenly Light Quartet. That’s him, below, with Guerrino in the background getting ready to begin.
Each of these three conductors was a joy to watch at work. So knowledgeable — so animated! — and able to sing each part (bass, tenor, soprano, alto), they lifted us up with their energetic love of the music and of teaching it. What a joy.
Members of Guerrino’s choir in Mercatello joined us for our concert there, and in Firenze we were treated to exceptional performances by Edoardo’s choir, Animae Voces, who also joined us for some tunes.
Now I am in Anghiari, ‘my’ beloved medieval village near Arezzo, very happy to be here again so unexpectedly soon, thanks to one person dropping out of the singing tour before it began. [I spent last November and December here.] ‘Making Music in Italy’, organised by a Byron Bay-based outfit, The Create Escape, had been fully booked when I inquired about it months before. When I tossed my cap in, I assumed it unlikely that a spot would become available — but it did! So, with just four weeks to get myself prepared — flights, insurance, what to do after the tour, and so on — I said yes. Life is short, yes?
I have always eschewed the idea of group tours, but now I am very glad I took what felt like a leap of faith and dived in. The accommodation in Montestigliano, Mercatello and then Firenze was excellent and interesting in different ways; we ate sumptuous meals, had some lovely parties and stimulating side trips as well as the pleasure of learning. (You can see a snippet of one of those parties here.)
One of the side trips was to the hilltop restaurant Il Girone dei Golosi just out of Mercatello; another was to the beautiful organic winery Pomaio near the town of Arezzo where we went for lunch on the way to Firenze (see pics below).
I’m sure we all made some lovely new friends. (And here I must make special mention of Susie and David from the Northern Rivers who had the brilliant idea of making this tour the first leg of their honeymoon! It was a treat for all of us to have them along.)
Now I’ve seen more of Tuscany than I had before. It is my fifth time visiting Anghiari and I’ve opted to spend a month here to catch up with acquaintances I have come to know and love. After all, the airfare is just the same for six weeks as for two, isn’t it?
A presto. Mimi :)
PS: If you would like to see the choir in action, some parts of our concerts can be found on YouTube. Go to ‘Making Music in Italy, 2024’. You’re welcome. xx

It was June 2023 when I drove to Italy for 3 weeks to find a second house or a renovation project in Italy. I had sold my house in the Netherlands as I felt it was time to move forward without any mortgage. Freedom.
Initially I was focussed on moving to Spain. My boyfriend’s native language is Spanish, and learning Spanish is already a challenge. Putting another language in the mix like Italian, didn’t feel very useful. Long story short, I couldn’t get a homy feeling in Spain, and I always loved and felt connected with Italy. Italy it was.
Like many house searchers, Idealista is a great way to start. With a long list of 50+ houses I drove to my preferred area around Lucca and further up the coast in Liguria. Obviously many houses weren’t at all what they seemed online, but more, I couldn’t see myself living in those areas. Secondly, I was all over the place with what I was looking for: a nice holiday home or a golden gem like a big mansion to renovate.
Having one week left, I went back to the heart of Piemonte where I had spent the first 2 nights. I ended up in a B&B owned and run by Francesca. We clicked and I loved the area: the rolling soft hills with its vineyards, the laid back little villages with one bar in the center as the communal place to meet each other for coffee or an aperitivo.
I visited some more houses in the area but nothing came even close to making my heart jump a tiny bit with excitement. This is not the right way, I felt. Let’s reverse the process: stop hunting, trust that life will show me what or where to look next. As a side note, I always bought the houses I lived in very intuitively, which has never let me down. In fact, it has given me a lot of financial expansion over the years.
I just posted my ‘I trust the universe’ post on facebook when the cousin of Francesca stepped into the garden. 10 minutes later, he offered to show me his house down the road that he bought a year ago. Would I be interested to buy his house as his plans had changed?
Is this a sign? Curious as I am, I said that I would be open to explore. It wasn’t love at first sight. It wasn’t the Liberty House from early 20th century with heigh painted ceilings I was hoping to find, but it was huge! And that ignited my interior design excitement. I love a good renovation challenge! I have had my design business for 13 years, and although I never see myself in that role again, I love to be my own client!
3 Months later I signed the contract, and became resident in one day. The house, with a potential of 600m2 living space and 14000 m2 land, was mine. Definitely a design challenge as 40% of the house, the barn with its hay attic, needs a complete transformation. For Italian standards the whole process went very smoothly, mainly due to great help I received from the seller!
Why did I say yes? It just felt like the one thing to do. Not just buying it, but to move out of the Netherlands immediately and start something new. It all felt right: the potential of the house with 7–8 bedrooms and the potential for an equal number of bathrooms, living spaces to share and some to keep private, enough space for my children to come and stay, alone or with their friends and the idea of creating a business sanctuary, whatever that will be…I felt a new phase opened up. How exciting!
Back to the summer of 2023. My partner wasn’t as thrilled as I was when I showed him the house the first time. Understandable! His favourite spot to visit, the Netherlands, was suddenly swapped for a rural area with a bunch of farmers. Having a long distance relationship for 6 years now, travelling between Lima-Peru and The Netherlands very frequently, has worked well for us, but will it be the same with my drastic move?
While I didn’t really involve my partner in the decision, I did involve my 3 (young adult) children! Perhaps not realising the complete impact of this move, they were supportive of my choice. I feel blessed with their ability to give me this space although it certainly hasn’t always been easy for them for different reasons.
So here I am, 14 months later. A year of learning and rooting. Slowly learning the language. Connecting with the ground I live on. Making the house with simple means a home for now until the renovation is done. Enjoying the simplicity of life in the country. Meeting so many beautiful new people, of which a few are becoming good friends.
And of course, not everything goes easy and smoothly. My renovation started with a classic mistake, trusting the wrong person and ignoring my inner doubt as I was too eager to get started. It has cost me quite a sum of money with which I had come to terms with for myself. I felt so angry and frustrated but also a bit ashamed with my mistake. Shouldn’t I know better as an experienced renovator and intuitive person?
I stopped working with the first contractor, continued with his collaborating partner (as he was a victim of the whole situation as well) to finish the terraces and new swimming pool. Normally one starts with the house and the outer areas are last on the list. For sure it will turn out quite unpractical to have a new terrace while the whole house needs to be taken care of, but I am so happy I enjoyed a first summer with a lovely space outside and my beautiful new swimming pool. At least the pool can’t fall of the budget anymore! A lovely first summer, sharing it all with friends, family, and of course my children.
While I moved on my own to a country where I didn’t know anyone, I can’t say I ever felt alone or lonely. In fact, in between all the visits, and my own travelling to the Netherlands, Peru and some other places, I am happy to have some weeks on my own. I love the different seasons: fresh sunny spring, warm rain free summer, foggy autumn mornings and cold winters with the snowy mountains of the Alps as a postcard view from my terrace.
And the house? For a while I didn’t want to renovate it at all. I live so comfortably already, and I have enough rooms for guests to stay. My youngest spontaneously brought 7 friends for a week around New Years Eve. My son enjoyed a week in the summer with 6 of his friends! And you know, sharing 2 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms worked fine for everyone.
But after a few months, I felt the excitement bubbling up for the next phase of the renovation. I refreshed my skills so I could use my design software again. It had been a while but I really loved solving this big puzzle. How to make the best out of the house. This part had always been my favourite element of my interior business: creating the most optimal living spaces, a natural flow, all within the limits of the building and a budget. To me it is the definition of simplicity: creating such a design that solves all complexity (integrate all wishes affordably, elegantly, beautifully and within the limited space) while the results looks very natural like the house has always meant to be like that. In other words, I don’t like over designed houses for the sake of creating something new and expensive.
The house had grown on me, which made me change some of my initial ideas. I finalised the complete design in September. Now what? How to find the right contractor(s) this time? One that is flexible to find affordable and beautiful solutions: my budget is limited and my standard is high! But more importantly, finding one who is willing to work differently from the very bureaucratic way that is known in Italy and very costly in my view.
I did hire a geometra. A geometra works within the triangle of the municipality, the contractor and the house owner. A geometra can easily take 15–20% of the budget as an add on! That is excluding the costs for an architect, an interior designer and an engineer (for constructive calculations). I decided to hire my geometra only for the permit, the (ridiculous but mandatory) safety and security rules and some engineering guidance. I followed the same process as I did in the Netherlands for many years to receive budget proposals from 4 contractors. Well, that already made a pre-selection. Two of them resigned as they didn’t like my way. They would only give a quote based on the standard procedure here where the geometra prepares the whole costing format. Basically this means, they only have to fill in the price per item and you get a very clear overview per contractor what his offering is. Sounds great and good for comparing budgets, but quite costly for me and way less flexible.
Now I am left with 2 parties who both feel like good companies to work with. One of them is very eager to grow his business and the other has an established contracting business. I haven’t finalised the deals yet, but it feels like the project will be divided amongst these 2 parties.
I am excited to get started, to work with the workers wherever I can, find solutions and the right materials. I am best when I can design the little details in the moment.
Please follow along in this blog to read about my weekly updates, surprises, joys, fun facts and challenges as I navigate this BIG project!

When it comes to food, I do not mind experimenting now and then. While health has overtaken taste as the most significant determining factor, there’s always the possibility of eating healthy without making significant compromises when it comes to taste.
Having said that, there’s one food item for which I detest the idea of having plenty of options at my disposal or, for that matter, appreciating the modifications made during its preparation. I am very rigid when it comes to pizza. It is a personal favorite, and I look forward to enjoying every slice. As such, I prefer to play it safe, at least from my side.
I stick to margherita, the classic Italian variant, and refrain from having a detailed look at the menu of any pizzeria or restaurant. It is the safest option to place your bets on, I believe. Despite not being a picky eater per se, it will suffice to say that I am prudent when it comes to pizza. In fact, I even detest the idea of modifying or distorting my preferred choice.
There’s one aberration to that rule, though. I do not hesitate to contemplate another alternative if I’m…

We had promised our son that we would take him to Italy, especially since we named him after our memorable trip to the country over a decade ago. In 2024, we finally embarked on an 8-day journey to Italy, keeping our commitment to our beloved son and eager to share our past experiences with our kids.
(You can also read this article on my travel blog — GracefulTrips.com)
Upon arriving in Rome, we took the train to Florence, using it as our base for exploring nearby cities such as Siena, San Gimignano, and Pisa. We also took some time to explore Florence, known as the capital of artists. Afterward, we took the train back to Rome and visited all the famous historical sites before flying back home.
This article will list the cities we visited, not necessarily in chronological order.
We signed up for a walking tour, the best way to learn about this area. The guide showed us what all the buildings used to be and the stories behind them.
We could see the prints by the chariots and the original bricks on the streets (the ones marked with the letter V).

Been working in italy since 2014. Tipping was frowned upon. Then cover charges started popping up. Just got back after 3 weeks in Rome, Florence, and Rimini and EVERY restaurant had cover charges. At one restaurant the GS (servizo incluso) on checks plus the coperto (cover charge) equaled 50% of what I paid. I spent more between them than I do paying 20% in the US. I didn’t get back to France and Spain this year and wonder if they are doing the same?

Have you ever felt emotionally affected by a place that seems untouched by time? Matera is a city I love visiting. It’s a place that left an impression on me when I took a childhood church pilgrimage with mamma, and it’s a place that so instantly brings a great sense of appreciation to my life.
During a not so recent trip to Italy, I visited yet again this magical UNESCO site I encourage everyone to visit at least once, except this time I experienced the most humbling moment. As I was standing at the Chiesa Di Santa Maria Di Idris (Saint Mary of Idris), I was overwhelmed by the beauty and history surrounding me. As I walked through the church, I struck up a conversation with Rocco, a kind, older gentleman who volunteers to maintain this sacred space. His genuine interest in sharing the church’s history, with my genuine curiosity to know the deep roots of this sacred timecapsule, immediately fostered a sense of trust. He invited me to a hidden space behind the church, a small terrace with a breathtaking view of the cave dwellings below. As I stood there, looking out over centuries of history, I was moved to tears — this was more than a moment; it was a connection to the soul of Italy. I found myself at the mercy of a moment so raw, so full of the history and struggles of the people who lived and fought to survive there, that I was left breathless, feeling like I was part of something much larger, something that words alone could never express. After I took it all in, we returned inside, chatted some more, exchanged numbers and I left with the greatest gift of Matera — learning it’s history from someone who’s parents understood firsthand the art of making do with very little, and living a life of ration — something I boldly claim none of us reading this have any understanding of.

Out my window in New York I can see a tall white slice of a building where the Russian diplomatic corps lives. In that contained compound, there’s also a long, low building with a big round window, a school for their children. What are the mindsets of people there — especially when they see protesters waving the Ukraine flag across the street? What kind of history lessons do they teach those kids?
I mention this curious, closed-off world because it’s the kind of environment that can send fiction writers down long trails of exploration. And if all their research and imaginings lead to a vivid, unusual tale, readers may scratch their heads and wonder how the heck the writer came up with it.
When I read a new novel by Paolo Bacigalupi, Navola, I did some of that proverbial head scratching. It’s set in an alternative version of Renaissance Italy, filled with deception, vast wealth, and cut-throat power plays. So many questions surfaced in my mind, which led to some unexpected discoveries.
Before getting into that, here’s a little bit about Bacigalupi and the novel. If you’re a sci-fi fan, you might have gone head-over-heels for his first published novel, The Windup Girl, which picked up two of the most prized awards in the genre, a Hugo and a Nebula, along with other honors. Maybe you read some of his work that came after that — until he disappeared from the literary scene. Then last year, he rose up once again with Navola.
This marks the first time that Bacigalupi has dived into the fantasy genre. He sidestepped many of the usual suspects — magic spells, knights, princesses, witches, elves. But he did dust off the old dragon trope and gave it a strange quality. We first learn about it in the book’s opening paragraph, which begins:
“My father kept a dragon eye upon his desk. An orb larger than a man’s skull, gone milky and crystalline but still burning with inner fire as if it retained life.”
MISFIT IN A POWERFUL FAMILY
The narrator is a boy, and later a young man, born into a banking family. The young scion, Davico, may be extraordinarily wealthy, but he can’t meet the huge expectations of the father he so reveres. Davico is educated in warfare and how to perceive the dark secrets that are rife in Navola, the city-state where he lives. He pushes himself to become a master negotiator and to achieve far-reaching knowledge about all the bank’s clients. But he seems to always fall short. His passions and natural gifts lie elsewhere.
One of his gifts has to do with that dragon’s eye. The relic isn’t mentioned very frequently and seems inert to everyone but Davico, who senses its pent-up power. It seems like it’s going to do something. But what? I read much later into the night than I should have, wondering about that.
Another reason for my sleep deprivation had to do with a character named Celia. She arrives just after Davico’s father wreaks revenge against her family, which had plotted to overthrow his power. The father decides to adopt Celia, giving Davico an unexpected sister. It makes for an awkward introduction.
Over the course of the novel, Celia transforms from a subdued, quiet girl into a vivacious wit who is able to navigate through the treacherous, opulent world much more easily than Davico.
A third reason why I couldn’t stop reading relates to Bacigalupi’s master skills of foreshadowing, teasing the reader about what’s to come without giving much away. Consider the confessional tone of Davico in this passage, which is addressed to his readers:
“I have lost interest in hiding who I was or what I have become. I am tired of the lies and excuses, and wish only to lay myself bare before you, so that you at least will understand, even if you do not forgive.”
In addition to all my curiosity about where the book was headed, I also started to wonder about Bacigalupi’s inspirations and how the book had come about. It was so different than what I’d read of his other work.
It wasn’t hard to discern that novel’s world was some ancient version of Italy. Bacigalupi also invented certain words, gestures and body markings that seemed to borrow from Italian culture. But where was that all coming from? With a name like Paolo Bacigalupi, I assumed that he had an Italian family history. I was wrong.
My research uncovered an unexpected set of circumstances. Navola’s storyline came to him at a time when he was no longer interested in exploring the sci-fi topics he’d become known for, like changes in the world due to extreme weather and bioengineering.
‘NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,’ NEW AVENUE
He explained his mindset in a Write-Minded podcast interview: “A lot of the [future] trends that my brain locks onto are the frightening ones. And so you end up spending time being sort of anxious in your daily life. And then you go into this creative space where you actually expand on those anxieties and go deeper and deeper into them. And it builds this sort of, I don’t know, synergistic toxicity. And eventually I just broke down, fundamentally. I kind of had a nervous breakdown.”
A new way forward gained momentum during a trip to Italy with a friend, who wanted to learn Italian by living in Bologna. Bacigalupi had gone along for the ride. But it turned into so much more than that. Italian architecture and history proved fertile ground for his imagination, and that’s so evident in Navola’s landscape.
“One of the things about Bologna was all these rival families in the city would build these towers, and they were defensive towers for their families, but they were also statements of wealth and importance,” he told Locus magazine in a December 2024 article.
“The landscape is telling you something about politics, saying, ‘Oh, this city is not a cohesive political unit, even though you’ve got a wall that goes around the whole city — inside it, there are armed factions who war with each other, and retreat into their towers when they’re unsafe, then come out and attack each other. They’d imprison one another in their towers, all sorts of stuff. You can see this layer of anarchy clearly established in the architecture, and that’s not something that I would have organically thought of, but it’s something that I could observe and then steal and bring into my own world.”
There was at least one unexplored story thread in Navola that I kept waiting to play out as the pages turned. And while it never did, I suspect it was a little hint about what’s to come. At the time he was interviewed by Locus, Bacigalupi had written 60,000 to 80,000 words of a sequel book. As with Navola, it will be published by Knopf.
“I’m going to let the story be as long as it wants to be. If I need to go back to Knopf and offer another book, I’ll do that. If I can wrap it up elegantly in two, I’ll do that,” he said at that time. “I’m trying to be as loose as I can with it and allow the thing to take on the shape that it wants.”
With or without that dragon’s eye, I’ll be waiting.

That’s what a friend told me before I went to my next travel destination, and she was right. It was summer in England, but it did not feel like it (knowing English weather ☺), so a quick summer getaway to Lake Como seemed like a good idea. And mind you, Italy never disappoints.
For my first photo blog, I would like to share my experience of my recent trip to Lake Como. Lake Como, or Lago di Como in Italian, is located in the Lombardy region in the northern part of Italy. It is surrounded by different towns, and visually, it looks like an inverted Y when you look at it on the map. Popular for its beautiful waters, majestic grand villas and gorgeous Italian towns, it has always been a favourite summer destination for locals and tourists around the world.
There are several towns surrounding the lake, and the most popular ones are Varenna, Bellagio, Menaggio and Como. For this trip I decided to stay in Varenna for its strategic location and more peaceful scenery compared to other major towns. I stayed in Lake Como for 4 days. I know it might not be long enough because there are still lots to see and explore.
How I got there:
I travelled from London Heathrow to Milan Malpensa airport since the nearest and most convenient airport to reach Lake Como. After landing in Milan, it took fifty minutes to an hour via train from Milan Centrale to reach Varenna. You can buy your train tickets from the airport or by using the Trenitalia app on your mobile phone. My advice is to book your tickets via the app in advance because train tickets might be difficult to book, especially during peak seasons. Trains usually depart every hour, and a one-way ticket costs me 11 euros for a first-class seat. To be honest, I’m not sure if it was too hot in Italy at that time, that the temperature in the train was too warm as well. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant journey overall.
Where I stayed:
I decided to stay in the town of Varenna in the eastern part of the Lake. My stay in the town was pleasant and calm, probably because of the smaller crowd since there were fewer restaurants and establishments in the area. There were different accommodations to choose from, ranging from high-cost hotels to cheaper, but still comfy ones. Just a quick warning, though, there were several areas in Italy where air conditioning in hotel buildings was regulated at specific times of the year. Be sure to do your research before choosing your accommodation. My hotel was a 5-minute walk from Varenna Train Station, which was also a big plus for me.
What I did:
There were several exciting activities that you can do in Lake Como. It ranges from walking tours, visiting Italian architectures on each town, visiting beautiful villas via boat tours, dipping into the lake and many more.
First Stop
After checking in the hotel, I went straight to a pre-booked tour of two of the most beautiful Villas in Varenna, Villa Monastero and Hotel Villa Cipressi. Roaming around Villa Monastero, you can see the attractive garden and the majestic view of Lake Como. The view of the lake was so stunning, and I’m sure you will be amazed too. It’s one reason why many movies were filmed here, like Oceans Twelve, Casino Royale and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.
I went straight to Hotel Villa Cipressi and enjoyed the view of the garden and the lake while sipping Aperol Spritz and eating Italian panini! Truly Dolce Vita! The Villa is part of a hotel that has a restaurant and bar open to both guests and non-guests. There were so many Instagrammable spots in both villas, and I recommend that you visit them.
After visiting the villas, I explored Varenna on foot to see what this town has to offer. I went to the town centre and there were couple of restaurants along the lake shore. The place was a bit crowded since it was summertime but still manage to roam around and find amazing spots, fancy restaurants and local stores.
The lake view was so serene especially during golden hours. It was so pristine and calming for the senses and worth capturing on your camera lenses.
As I walked back to my hotel, I saw group of people enjoying the sun and having a dip in the lake. I should have brought my swimming trunks and sunscreen with me ha-ha.
I ended up the day having authentic Italian pizza and a glass, uhm okay glasses of red wine ha-ha.
There will be more stories to come in the second part of my Lake Como journey. Hope you enjoyed this short blog and can’t wait to share the rest in the next part! Thanks for reading!

Favorite Chocolate Shops in Italy
With Valentine’s Day, thoughts turn to chocolate. Here’s an excerpt from “100 Places in Italy Every Woman Should Go” to help you find the best places for chocolate in Italy…
“Let them eat chocolate,” was the kind proclamation of Madama Reale.
The year was 1678. Madama Reale was thirty years old, widowed, with a boy to raise, and had become the ruler of the Piedmont region in northern Italy. She took her job seriously and carried on major beautiful changes to the city during her reign , continuing in the tradition her husband had began, remodeling the Palazzo Madama into pretty French style.
In Madama Reale’s day chocolate was a precious novelty served only to royalty and priests. It had come to Italy through the Spanish explorer Cortez, who found it in South America.
When a Turin baker asked Madame Reale’s permission to make chocolate for regular folk, I imagine she figured, “Why not?” She probably needed the seritonin fix to deal with the hassles of being a female ruler and wanted to pass on the high to keep her popularity ratings up.

Italy is an extraordinary country that blends history, art, culture, cuisine, and natural beauty in an unparalleled manner. From its ancient ruins to its vibrant cities and picturesque landscapes, Italy has captivated the hearts of millions. In this article, we will explore the various aspects that make Italy unique, from its rich history to its diverse regional offerings.
Italy is often called the birthplace of Western civilization. The ruins of ancient Rome, providing remnants of its powerful empire, speak to its historical significance. The Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon are not just tourist attractions; they are testaments to a bygone era that shaped architecture, governance, and law in many parts of the world.
The Renaissance period flourished in Italy, primarily in cities like Florence, Venice, and Milan. This cultural movement saw the emergence of remarkable artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, whose works have left an indelible mark on art and culture globally. The legacy of the Renaissance continues to influence modern design, art, and literature.
Italy boasts an astronomical number of art treasures. The Vatican Museums, showcasing works by Raphael and Michelangelo, are one of the most visited destinations in the world. Additionally, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence houses masterpieces from the likes of Botticelli and Titian. The sheer volume of artistic genius within Italy’s borders is unmatched.
Italy’s architecture is as diverse as its regions. The iconic Leaning Tower of Pisa, the intricate Gothic facades of Milan Cathedral, and the romantic canals of Venice star in the country’s architectural repertoire. Furthermore, the charm of small medieval towns, with their cobbled streets and historic buildings, add to Italy’s architectural allure.
Italian cuisine is celebrated worldwide, but what makes it distinctively unique is its regional diversity. From the rich risottos of Northern Italy to the fresh seafood of the Amalfi Coast, each region offers unique flavors and traditions. Dishes like pizza, pasta, and gelato have their roots in specific locales, showcasing the country’s culinary heritage.
Italian culinary excellence is tied to its commitment to high-quality, local ingredients. Olive oil, fresh vegetables, cheeses, and meats play a crucial role in traditional dishes. The Mediterranean lifestyle, which is intrinsic to Italian culture, emphasizes a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, promoting wellness and enjoyment of food.
Italy’s landscapes are incredibly varied. From the rolling hills of Tuscany, adorned with vineyards and olive groves, to the stunning cliffs of the Amalfi Coast, the country’s natural beauty is breathtaking. The Dolomites in the North attract outdoor enthusiasts with their rugged peaks, while the serene beaches in Sardinia offer a slice of paradise.
Italy is home to the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world, with over 58 sites. This includes the picturesque landscapes of the Cinque Terre, the historical and architectural wonders of Venice, and the cultural landscapes of the Val d’Orcia. Each site tells a story of the intertwined relationship between nature and human creativity.
Italy’s cultural calendar is sprinkled with festivals that showcase the nation’s heritage and local traditions. Events such as Carnevale in Venice and the Palio di Siena draw crowds with lively parades, colorful costumes, and thrilling horse races. These festivals provide insight into the local way of life, uniting communities in shared joy and celebration.
Italian culture places a strong emphasis on family and community. Meals are often shared events, where multiple generations gather to enjoy traditional dishes. This communal spirit fosters a sense of belonging and reinforces the importance of relationships in everyday life.
Italian is often considered one of the most beautiful languages in the world. Its melodic tones and expressive vocabulary contribute to its uniqueness. The language is also a significant part of Italy’s identity, with numerous dialects reflecting the rich diversity of various regions.
Italy has a rich literary tradition, with significant contributions from authors such as Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Umberto Eco. The literary works originating from Italy often explore themes of love, philosophy, and human experience, reflecting the nation’s diverse cultural heritage.
Italy is synonymous with high fashion. Cities like Milan are considered global fashion capitals, housing revered designers such as Valentino, Prada, and Gucci. The Milan Fashion Week is a pivotal event in the fashion industry, showcasing cutting-edge designs and trends.
Beyond fashion, Italian design is celebrated in industries such as automotive (Ferrari, Maserati), furniture, and architecture. Italian designers prioritize functionality while maintaining a strong emphasis on aesthetics, leading to innovative and timeless creations.
Some of the top tourist destinations include Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, and the Amalfi Coast. Each of these locations offers unique attractions, historical landmarks, and cultural experiences.
The best time to visit is typically during the spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) when the weather is pleasant, and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak summer months.
It is advisable to dress smartly in Italy, especially when dining out or attending religious sites. Comfortable walking shoes are also essential for exploring cities and towns.
Must-try dishes include pizza Napoletana, pasta carbonara, risotto alla Milanese, and gelato. Each region has its specialties, so be sure to explore local cuisines.
Overall, Italy is considered a safe country for tourists. However, it’s wise to stay vigilant and take standard precautions against pickpockets, especially in crowded areas.
Italy’s unique blend of history, culture, cuisine, and stunning landscapes continues to inspire travelers from all over the world. The country’s rich tapestry makes it not only a destination but also a profoundly dynamic experience that lingers in the hearts and minds of those who visit.

Italy is a beautiful country, full of history, culture, and delicious food. But what if I told you that you can explore and enjoy this country to the fullest without compromising on your lifestyle as a digital nomad? As someone who has stayed in over 2000 hotels across Italy, I specialize in finding mid-range accommodations with a budget of €60–110 per night, focusing on 3 or 4-star hotels. My experience has taught me to strike a balance between comfort and cost, making the most out of each stay without going to extremes.
In this article, I’ll share with you some of the best tips and tricks I’ve learned along the way. But this is just the beginning! Throughout this series, we’ll go beyond the basics of “where to stay” and “what to eat,” diving into the practicalities of living well on the road: how to maximize your experience, find hidden gems, and maintain a high quality of life that goes beyond mere survival.
Who Am I?
I’m a digital nomad with a unique perspective. I work as a technical consultant for a multinational company, splitting my time between freelance projects and a steady job that takes me all over Italy — and sometimes beyond. Because of my work, I’m always on the move, and I’ve made it my mission to find the best places to live, eat, and work remotely, no matter where I am.
But unlike some digital nomads, I’m not willing to live like a “poor man” nomad, squeezing myself into the cheapest hostels and cutting corners just to get by. I also refuse to become a “digital hermit,” living in isolation away from the pulse of the cities. Instead, I aim to thrive — finding a balance between comfort, productivity, and enjoyment. And that’s what I want to share with you in this series.
What Does It Cost to Travel Well in Italy?
Let’s start with the basics: What does it cost to travel well in Italy? I’m not talking about scraping by on a tight budget. I’m talking about a lifestyle that includes good food, nice hotels, and experiences that leave you feeling fulfilled.
How to Travel Around Italy Efficiently
Italy’s public transportation system is good, but knowing how to navigate it can save you a lot of time and stress. However, unlike many digital nomads, I don’t often find myself traveling between big cities like Rome and Milan, where trains are ideal, or from Rome to Catania, where a plane would be the obvious choice.
Why and when Traveling by Car is Essential in Italy
Unlike in many other countries, my job rarely takes me to the major hubs like Rome or Milan, where trains and planes would be the most practical options. Instead, I travel to small towns and villages off the beaten path — places that are hard to reach by public transportation. If you’re in a similar line of work, it’s crucial to understand that the car becomes your lifeline.
Driving in Italy is not only a practical necessity but also a way to fully experience the country. Italy is densely populated and full of charming towns and villages that are worth exploring. Driving to get your groceries or grabbing a beer in a small village becomes an unparalleled experience!
Given the layout and structure of Italian towns, unless you want to be a “caravan nomad” moving with public transportation, a car is essential. And if you enjoy driving as much as I do, it’s an experience to cherish rather than a burden. Italy is not like Spain, where cities are spread out and public transport is a more viable option. Here, the car is strategic. I’ll share with you some tips on how to make the most of it and save money while you’re at it.
Tips for Enjoying Your Hotel Stays
One of the perks of my job is staying in a wide variety of hotels. Whether it’s a 5-star luxury resort or a small boutique hotel in a hidden village, I’ve learned a few tricks to make every stay more enjoyable:
The Joy of Exploring Small Towns in Italy
One of the true joys of traveling around Italy is exploring its many small towns and villages. Every region has its own charm, and the people are often warm and welcoming. The best part? Even in the most remote locations, you’ll rarely feel isolated. Unlike in some other countries, where you can feel like a stranger in the countryside, in Italy you’re more likely to be invited to a local event or to share a meal.
This is why you’ll never feel like a “digital hermit” in Italy — unless you choose to be. The density of the towns and the hospitality of the people make it easy to connect, network, and create meaningful experiences, no matter where you are.
Wrapping It Up
Italy has so much to offer, and it’s possible to experience it all without compromising on quality. This is just the beginning of a series of articles where I’ll explore various Italian and European destinations, sharing what it truly means to live well as a digital nomad.
Stay tuned for more articles where I’ll dive deeper into specific cities and regions, sharing hidden gems, recommended hotels, and, of course, the best places to eat. Because living like a digital nomad shouldn’t be about “making do” — it should be about living well.

Touching down in Italy for the first time was simply magical. The warm Mediterranean breeze greeted me as I stepped off the plane, carrying with it tantalizing hints of freshly baked pizza and rich espresso. My senses were immediately awakened by the vibrant hues of the landscape and the animated chatter in melodic Italian. Rome’s bustling street life unfurled before me with scooter-filled alleyways, ancient ruins peeking around burgeoning modernity, and lively piazzas brimming with locals and tourists alike. It was here, while savoring a creamy gelato beside the majestic Colosseum, that I first fell in love with Italy’s intoxicating blend of history and contemporary charm.
Wandering through Italy’s cities revealed a tapestry of experiences that surpassed all my expectations. From the romantic canals of Venice to the artistic fervor of Florence, and the fashion-forward streets of Milan, each city possessed its own unique character and allure. The locals’ warm hospitality made me feel like I was welcomed into a large, extended family, eager to share their rich cultural heritage. I was captivated by the seamless way ancient monuments coexisted with modern conveniences, creating urban landscapes that felt both timeless and vibrant. What truly surprised me was how every corner of Italy offered something different; a culinary delight, a hidden historical gem, or a breathtaking view that left me in awe.
Italy’s cities are like a playground for the curious traveler, each offering a distinct set of adventures waiting to be discovered. Join me as we delve into the top 10 must-visit cities across this enchanting country. Buckle up for a journey through Italy’s urban gems, where history whispers through cobblestone streets and modernity pulses through lively markets and trendy cafes.
Although the post describes 10 experiences in , Italy, you can explore 2947 experiences in , as well as thousands of other cities across the globe on Travel Ninja. Watch the video below for more information, and download the app at Travel Ninja.
Stepping off the plane in Rome felt like diving into a living, breathing history lesson drenched in vibrant modernity. The first thing that struck me was the timeless grandeur of the architecture — ancient ruins stood majestically beside chic boutiques and lively cafes. As I strolled through the bustling streets, I encountered a fascinating blend of people: tourists eagerly snapping photos at the Colosseum, locals animatedly chatting in small piazzas, and street performers adding an artistic flair to the atmosphere. The hum of scooters zipping by and the welcoming aroma of freshly baked pizza were a sensory delight. I managed my expenses well, finding accommodations in a charming mid-range B&B for around €80 a night and enjoying delicious meals for approximately €10-€20 per meal.
During an early morning exploration, the usually crowded Trevi Fountain was serene and almost ethereal in the soft dawn light. It was then that I met a couple from Argentina, and we shared our travel stories over espresso, marveling at the fusion of Rome’s ancient roots with its contemporary vibe. The energy shifted noticeably during the off-hours; the city seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, offering a more intimate glimpse into its heart. This visit made me appreciate how Rome thrives on its contrasts — tradition and modernity, hustle and tranquility — all of which are seamlessly woven together in its cultural tapestry. This immersion deepened my admiration for the city and gave me a richer understanding of its unique social fabric.
Exploring Venice felt like stepping into a living painting. The narrow, winding streets blend seamlessly with majestic canals, buzzing with vaporettos and gondolas. At every corner, there’s a mix of excited tourists and locals casually sipping espressos or chatting in lilting Italian. With a budget of €50 a day, I savored delicious cicchetti at vibrant bacari, sipping Spritz Aperol and marveling over Saint Mark’s Basilica’s intricate mosaics. The blend of ancient architecture and contemporary life is stunning. Venice is both a historical marvel and a hub of modern energy.
Dawn strolls across the Rialto Bridge, practically deserted, offered me quiet moments to soak in the serene beauty. One delightful incident involved a cheerful American couple who, upon sharing their map, eagerly guided me to the lesser-known Fondaco dei Tedeschi terrace. We debated the best gelato flavors while marveling at the panoramic view. Interactions like these made me realize how Venice serves as a meeting point of cultures, fostering camaraderie among strangers. The trip deepened my appreciation for how Venetians preserve their rich heritage while embracing the cosmopolitan vibe — it’s a city where tradition beautifully dances with modernity. Can’t wait for your stories!
Upon arriving in Florence, the city greeted me with an intoxicating mix of history and vibrant modern life. The cobblestone streets whispered tales of the Renaissance as Vespa scooters buzzed by, creating a lively, eclectic atmosphere. Walking towards the heart of the city, I marveled at the grandeur of the Duomo, its pink and green marble facade glistening in the sunlight. The bustling Piazza della Signoria was a feast for the senses — gelato shops with their rainbow assortments, the grandeur of Palazzo Vecchio, and street musicians playing classical melodies. With my stepping counter enthusiastically tallying more than 15,000 steps, I felt every euro spent was worth it — entrance fees to museums (€15–20 each) and delicious meals at cozy trattorias (€10–15 per meal).
As evening fell, the city transformed into a romantically lit wonderland. Less crowded now, I wandered along the banks of the Arno River, the Ponte Vecchio glowing under the streetlights. I struck up a conversation with a couple from Brazil at a quaint wine bar, and we swapped travel stories over a glass of Chianti (€5). The blend of tradition met modernity beautifully here, from historic architecture to chic boutiques. This juxtaposition deepened my appreciation for the city’s dynamic character. Florence isn’t just a relic of the past; it’s a living, breathing city, full of creativity and life. My experience was an eye-opener to the cultural depth of Florence, where each encounter, be it with locals or fellow travelers, is a brushstroke in a rich, colorful canvas.
Walking through Milan feels like stepping into a living blend of history and modernity. My visit began at the awe-inspiring Duomo di Milano, a gothic cathedral that pierced the sky with its spires. As I marveled at its intricate facades, the bustling Piazza del Duomo spread before me, where chic locals mingled with eager tourists. The energy was palpable, with street performers adding to the vibrant ambiance. For a reasonable 10 euros, I ascended to the rooftop, where the city’s panorama offered glimpses of both medieval structures and contemporary skyscrapers. I’ve never felt such a unique blend of past and present.
Exploring the streets, I encountered high-end fashion boutiques nestled beside centuries-old cafes, symbolizing Milan’s knack for harmonizing tradition with the avant-garde. An evening aperitivo in the Navigli district was an unforgettable experience — think canal-side bars with a backdrop of golden sunsets, a spread of delicious appetizers for just 12 euros, and lively conversations with fellow travelers from all over the world. I exchanged stories with an architect from Tokyo who came to Milan to study its renowned design styles. These interactions and the city’s dynamic atmosphere deepened my appreciation for Milan’s role as a global cultural hub. Even during the quieter hours, the city’s spirit remained vibrant, resonating with the whispers of history intertwined with the buzz of contemporary life.
Naples, ah, what an unforgettable adventure it was! Stepping off the train, the city welcomed me with its vibrant and bustling energy. The air felt electric, rich with the smell of fresh pizza wafting through narrow, cobblestone streets lined with Vespas and ancient buildings, effortlessly blending the old with the new. I found myself among a varied crowd — from stylishly dressed locals to backpacking tourists, all contributing to a chaotic, yet harmonious atmosphere. A slice of authentic Margherita pizza cost me a modest 4 euros and was worth every penny. As I meandered through the cities alleyways, I stumbled upon an impromptu street performance that turned a casual evening into a lively, shared experience, underscoring Naples’ vibrant social culture.
During quieter moments, like early mornings before the city fully awakes, I could almost hear the whispers of history amidst the stillness. Walking along the waterfront, with Mount Vesuvius majestically framing the skyline, I felt a mixture of awe and peace. An encounter with a friendly fellow traveler at a small, family-run café led to an intriguing conversation about Naples’ transformation over the years. Their insights into the juxtaposition of the city’s time-honored traditions with modern flair deepened my appreciation for Naples’ unique character — a city where past and present coexist in perfect symphony. Whether exploring the ancient ruins of Pompeii just a train ride away, or marveling at contemporary street art, Naples enchanted me with its seamless blend of history, culture, and vitality.
Stepping into Amalfi felt like walking straight into a living postcard. Nestled between the rugged cliffs and cerulean waters, the town exudes both nostalgia and vibrant energy. The atmosphere was intoxicating — sun-drenched piazzas brimming with locals and tourists alike, mingling as the scent of fresh lemon groves wafted through the air. With a budget of around €120 per day, I managed to grab gelato on the bustling main street and watched as couples and families chatter animatedly over espresso at sidewalk cafes. The quaint shops boasted everything from hand-painted ceramics to luxurious silk scarves, standing as a testament to Amalfi’s seamless blend of tradition with modern splendor.
Despite the lively crowds, there were tranquil moments during the early morning and late afternoon. Wandering through the narrow alleyways when they were almost deserted, I felt an intimate connection to the soul of the town. An elder local, noticing my curiosity about the stunning Duomo di Sant’Andrea, shared tales of the cathedral’s storied past, enriching my appreciation for its architectural grandeur. As evening fell, I joined a group of fellow travelers at a small trattoria where we feasted on fresh seafood and homemade pasta for less than €30 each. Our conversations flowed effortlessly, bridging diverse backgrounds and languages. This encounter illuminated Amalfi’s unique charm — a place where time-honored traditions coexist with the thriving pulse of contemporary life, fostering a deep sense of belonging and community. My visit wasn’t just a trip; it was a gateway to understanding the rich, multifaceted culture of Amalfi.
Stepping off the train at Sorrento felt like walking into a sun-drenched painting. The narrow streets burst with vibrant colors — blue and yellow tiles lining the walls, vivid bougainvillea spilling over canopies. The air was a divine blend of citrus and sea salt, creating an intoxicating atmosphere that was both grounding and exhilarating. I strolled along the bustling Piazza Tasso, where locals and tourists melded in a lively dance of conversation. For just about 15 Euros, I enjoyed the creamiest gelato as I soaked in the scene — a symphony of clinking glasses, laughing children, and the occasional Vespa zipping by. The town harmonizes timeworn traditions with modern charm effortlessly, from ancient architecture to chic cafes.
Off-hours revealed a quieter, more contemplative side of Sorrento. Early mornings were my favorite, as I wandered the virtually empty Marina Grande. The fishermen were returning with their catch, exchanging hearty greetings in musical Neapolitan dialects. A friendly local named Marco invited me to join a small group savoring freshly-cooked seafood — free of charge! His stories of Sorrento’s history deepened my appreciation for the town’s timeless energy. Interacting with other visitors from around the globe, I relished discussions that ranged from travel tips to cultural insights. This unexpected camaraderie made me realize how Sorrento is not just a destination but a confluence of life, tradition, and modern pleasures that bring people together.
Walking through the cobblestone streets of Verona, the city feels alive with history and a touch of romantic whimsy. The air is filled with the soft hum of conversation, a symphony of Italian laced with laughter and the clang of espresso cups at corner cafes. The first thing that captures my attention is the Arena di Verona, an ancient Roman amphitheater that stands testament to both Verona’s past and its vibrant present as it still hosts operas and concerts. With a budget of around €30 for a guided tour and another €15 for a cappuccino and pastry at a charming café, I felt like I was living in a dream. The blend of medieval architecture with chic boutiques and restaurants painted a vivid contrast of tradition and modernity.
As the evening sun dipped below the horizon, I wandered into a quaint piazza where locals gathered for aperitivo. The mix of people — from elderly couples to young professionals and curious tourists like myself — added a rich tapestry of stories and energy. Striking up a conversation with a fellow traveler from Brazil, we shared thoughts on Juliet’s House and whether touching her statue really brings love luck. As the night deepened, so did my appreciation for Verona’s fusion of past and present; its traditional roots were palpable even as the city embraced a contemporary, globalized spirit. This visit wasn’t just a sightseeing trip; it was a soulful dive into a culture that balances heritage and modernity with grace and flair. If you’re planning your trip, set aside some time to simply absorb and enjoy Verona’s unique vibe.
Walking through the charming streets of Bologna, I felt like I had stepped into a living, breathing museum. The terracotta-roofed buildings, medieval towers, and long porticoes painting a fascinating blend of the old and new. The energy was palpable as locals darted through Piazza Maggiore on their morning errands while tourists marveled at the Basilica di San Petronio. I joined in, exploring on foot, and ended up having an impromptu coffee chat with a group of friendly university students. They introduced me to the best gelato in town, costing only €2.50, and shared stories of studying in this historic yet dynamic city.
As the day turned into night, Bologna transformed. The streets bustled with an eclectic mix of people — young professionals unwinding after work, street performers enchanting passersby, and elderly couples strolling hand in hand. Dinner at a local trattoria, where I spent about €15 for a plate of tagliatelle al ragù, was an absolute delight. It was here that I met a Dutch couple who were on a culinary tour of Italy. Our lively conversation about Bolognese traditions versus their modern aspirations gave me a deeper appreciation for Bologna’s unique character. By the late evening, as the city quieted down, I appreciated the serene yet lively ambiance that made Bologna feel like a timeless gem waiting to be discovered over and over again.
Imagine stepping into a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors and intoxicating sounds as you walk through the bustling streets of Palermo. The aroma of freshly baked sfincione — a local-style pizza — mingles with the scent of citrus from the vendors at the Ballarò Market. With a modest budget of €50 a day, I indulged in street food, savored an espresso at an alfresco café, and soaked up the local atmosphere. The streets were a lively mix of tourists and locals, each bringing their unique flair to the city’s intricate mosaic. The chatter in various dialects, combined with the honking of scooters zipping through narrow alleys, created a symphony that was quintessentially Palermo.
By evening, the city transitioned into a different rhythm. The grand Teatro Massimo was serenely lit, casting a majestic glow over the piazza. I met a fellow traveler from Argentina, and we shared our awe over Palermo’s confluence of ancient history and modern vitality. Wandering through the charming streets after hours, I marveled at how the city retained its old-world charm amidst modern cafes and boutiques. This visit truly deepened my appreciation for Palermo’s unique blend of tradition and innovation, making it a city that’s as timeless as it is contemporary. If you’re planning to visit, do spend an evening chatting with locals to fully savor this rich cultural tapestry.

Buongiorno! One of my favourite countries in this world? Italy! Pizza, pasta, and wine in masses, all under the dry heat of the sun with some of the most lovely people on earth.
This is one of my favourite places on earth, hands down. It is the kind of Tuscan village you see in movies and on postcards. Driving there on the street with cypress trees on both sides takes you back in time. Yes, this village is a little touristy but it is gorgeous and when in Tuscany, you need to go here. Nestled in green nature near the Mediterranean Sea you can find small restaurants, cafes, gelato, interior decor shops, wine and Italian specialities, it has everything your touristy Italian heart could ever desire. Go to the cafe in the middle of the town and treat yourself to an Espresso con Coretto (or with Grappa, they have both) with some Cantuccini or pastry of choice. Get lovely Ice Cream (the Bolgheri flavour is mouth-watering). Take a little sniff at the room perfumes in the interior store left from the gate.

This article was originally published in Spanish and you are invited to read it as well in my beautiful language here
I am not a psychologist. I could read a bunch of books to find answers to questions like why we enjoy dreaming, and why we love idealizing places, people, and situations… but I’m too lazy to do that.
All I know is that if you idealize your life, it’s probably because you like living in a self-generated Matrix avoiding some problem, denying it, or worse, you’ve always lived that way.
Nowadays, however, we have a huge choice of online resources, and it’s possible to get a real sense of what a place might be like: ideal for living or vacationing, boring or lively, safe or dangerous. You have the chance to even interact with its inhabitants long distance or, simply ask travelers about their experiences.
A few months ago a video of a girl went viral because she was complaining about how to get to Amalfi. She said she had to fly to Naples, take a train to Sorrento, a ferry to Amalfi, and finally climb lots of stairs to reach her hotel — all this in the height of summer, with that heat! Can you believe it?
She said influencers should be jailed for saying things that aren’t true… (deep breath…)
Here’s the thing: living is easy with eyes closed, but today you don’t have excuses. You have to be in the here and now. Whether it’s Instagram, YouTube, a book, or an article, you must remember that someone’s version of a place or an experience is subjective and probably idealized. You need to be aware that what you’re being sold on social media is either driven by economic convenience or because the person in question is feeding their delusion, trying to rope others into their fantasy.
You can’t plan your vacations, your life, or your career based on the ideas others give you. You have to go out into the world, connect with people, try, smell, ask, think critically, question, and then decide what to think, how to act, what to do, and where to go.
Mistakes are always lurking around the corner — you should always keep that in mind — but I can assure you that you’ll feel less frustrated knowing that you did everything yourself and consciously made the effort for your project to succeed.
Having said all this, I imagine you now understand why I said “No” in response to the title of this article.
But maybe I’m not so good at explaining my thesis, so here it is:
No, it’s not beautiful in Italy or anywhere else if you’ve decided to see life through filters, through the eyes of others — call them dream sellers, rich kids who study or live abroad, or immigrants who haven’t adapted to a new lifestyle or who’ve endured years of bitterness before achieving a decent standard of living and showing it off to you.
Life is beautiful only when you look at it with your own eyes and your ideas. It’s beautiful with both the good and the bad — not just when you see it through the Deep Summer filter.
Wake up!

Italy is often celebrated for its timeless art, history, and cuisine, but what truly makes this country special are the smaller, quieter experiences that usually go unnoticed. As an expat living amidst the Alps, I’ve discovered that there are countless opportunities to connect with nature, local traditions, and the changing seasons even in regions famed for their tourist attractions.
I forgot to tell you about my favourite event of the year here in the Alps: the narcissus flowering. There is something magical about seeing infinite meadows and feeling their perfume… By the way, I have a problem: I do not support many odors but the scent of narcissus I like and that is why I can say you that there is a big difference between the flowers that were 50 years ago and today: many flowers (and narcissus among them) do not have their fantastic profume they had when I was a girl.

I took a three-day trip to Italy on New Years. It was always my dream to visit the great Ancient Rome, so you can imagine how excited I was for this trip. Throughout my visit, I experienced some wonderful places, great food, and met new people. I want to share with you the rookie mistakes that I made, the things I did right, and ultimately what I learned from this experience. Here are some tips for navigating your way through the beautiful city of Rome.
Pack well (and right!!): Extra clothes, check, portable charger, check, type C, F, and L power outlet plugs, not check. Seriously, I spent the first half of my day there looking for electronic stores with the correct power outlet adapters. I made a rookie mistake, and hopefully, you will not have to.
Don’t pay extra. If anyone tries to convince you that you have to pay to get into the Vatican, I will assure you that you don’t. As soon as I arrived at the Vatican, I was unpleasantly approached by a man who apparently had only two tickets left to sell for the Vatican. Most might think that they “got lucky” and that they had just made it there in time before tickets were sold out, but that isn’t the case at all. Just keep your head up and walk right into the Vatican. It’s free. Thankfully, binge-watching travel videos on youtube helped me with that one.
Take lots of pictures. If you are traveling along, you can even ask tourists to take photos of you! As a solo traveler, I had plenty of time to soak in all the views and take my time appreciating all the sights and wonders. It is nice to take some pictures so you can reminisce later (who knows when you’ll be back). If you want to take some pictures of yourself, ask tourists if they’d be willing to take it for you, you’d be surprised how much photography talent there is in the crowd. If you see someone who could use a hand, offer to help them take their picture, they might offer to take yours back. Well, hey, it worked for me.
Plan well! I packed my day with wonderful sightseeing adventures and activities. It is crucial to check openings of the different places, especially on holidays. Unfortunately, I missed out on the great opportunity of seeing the Sistine Chapel because it was closed on the new year.
Throw a coin (or two) into the Trevi Garden. Legend has it that if you throw a coin over your head into the Trevi Fountain, chances are, you will return to Rome. If you throw two, you will return to Rome and fall in love, and three, you will return to Rome, fall in love, and get married there. I don’t know if this has been proven correct, but it can’t hurt to take your chances either way. Unluckily, I didn’t get to throw coins into the fountain, but have no doubt; I shall return.
Check out what Italy is known for, then make sure not to miss out. I enjoyed some delicious Italian Ice Cream, Pizza, and House Wine. The wine is incredibly affordable in Italy. While in the restaurant, don’t rush to receive the bill. It is customary in Italy to stick around and have a conversation after a nice meal.
Fly Ryanair! This one is a little bit controversial. If you asked me then if I would fly Ryanair again, I would have said that I would absolutely not. Looking back though, I realize how convenient it was to have a cheap flight from London to Rome. Just make sure you read exactly what you need to do when buying the ticket so they won’t charge you extra for late check-in or carry-on bags. If you don’t want to experience flight delays though, don’t fly with Ryanair. They might have cheaper flights, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost.
I hope asome of these travelling tips helped you out! I know that I need to take some of my own advice on my next trip to Rome.
Edit: This blog is a repost from 3 years ago when I first visited Rome. Hope you enjoy!

“Why are there so many tourist scammers? In the EU? How is that possible?!” I find myself pondering as I sit on a bench at Capitoline Hill in Rome, having just dismissed the fifth “salesman” hawking water/hats/bracelets/ whatever in the span of ten minutes. Perhaps equally surprising is the police who keep a few meters away but do not intervene.
“Consider this — by selling three bracelets they have an average hourly rate that could rival a much harder job in Glovo or something,” remarks my boyfriend having recently engaged in a lively argument with a guy offering him an African souvenir for free, which later suddenly appeared to cost “at least something”.
“But it’s illegal! It’s immoral! Do they have any respect for Italian culture? Or to humans at all? I simply couldn’t look up to the Colosseum because another guy f****d my mind forcing us to buy a ticket for the hop-on-hop-off bus!” I exclaim, my emotions getting the better of me. However, the worst was their pre-prepared reaction to every answer to the question “Where are you from?” My bad, I replied I was from Ukraine — and then they transformed the historic “Slava Ukraini” (“Glory to Ukraine”) into a cheap plea for me to…

Italy and Japan are also in a similar situation. Yet in Italy for example, Spain and other countries, there are entire villages with mostly empty houses; the state even pays foreigners to move there. Distance working enabled by excellent fiber optic connectivity to rural areas has to be a big part of the solution; I don’t see many others.

My family rented two Polestar 2 cars for a week long jaunt from Rome to Florence and around the Tuscan countryside, where we stayed at a beautiful villa for five nights, for a total around 1000 km. The catch was that the villa was sited for gorgeous views at the peak of a local hill on a farm that was accessed by 4–5 km of gravel road, depending on direction of approach. We obtained fast DC charging on the highway away from and back to Rome (more later), but there was no convenient fast charging near the villa.
The Polestars came with an EU wall outlet charging cable, so we were intent upon charging from outlets just inside the front and rear doors. Fortunately, the proprietors left out two grounding plug adaptors that mated with the Polestars’ cable, and we were off. Both outlets were on a single breaker, so only one car could be charged at a time, but at 2.3 kW, wall charging is faster than in the USA, and we were able to share the juice and obtain enough for extensive day trips in Tuscany. The catch was that the owners were unhappy with our solution on grounds that it violates their solar array agreement, which specifies “agricultural uses”. They did accept a nominal payment in compensation, however. We of course argued that they would benefit from offering this as a feature in their AirBnB listing.
On the highway, we charged at an Enel X charger at a shopping center, which offered only one 50 kW DC fast charging spigot with 5 slower Level 2 spigots. This was typical of most charging stations across Italy. So we had to time-share the two cars between a fast and a slow spigot, which seemed absurd coming from our experience with Tesla superchargers featuring at least 4–8 100–200 kW spigots per installation. A second session at a Evviva charging station benefitted from four fast spigots, but the initial 140 kW soon dropped to 70 kW when the second car was added.
Thankfully, the Evviva station recognized our Enel X app, but this was not at all apparent without some coaching from another EV driver who was incredibly helpful. The onboarding for Enel X charging had been quite painful, requiring download of an app, entry of quite a bit of personal information, and manual entry of credit card information. My attempt to register for an account was unsuccessful on three successive tries, but I was able to pay as guest, and the app put me in good shape for later charging on the Evviva chargers. But here’s the question:
Why is it possible to purchase fuel at most any gas station using only a credit card reader, but not at an EV charger? Who is blocking the adoption of a modern process for entering only the most rudimentary validating information (e.g. zip code), or more recently, simply tapping a card or a phone, without the frustrations of downloading apps or entering extensive personal information to set up “accounts” that are totally unnecessary?
For heaven’s sake, give me a charge and TAKE MY MONEY, already! We don’t owe you a database.

If you’re someone who daydreams about chasing la dolce vita, you should know that while many of us adore living in Italy, this country has plenty of problems. Some of these problems show signs of fixing, and others will likely take generations of cultural and behavioral changes to resolve.
Here are some particular reasons not to move to Italy, or at least reasons to keep in mind before doing so.
I once dated a kind, educated Italian man in his late 20s who seemed to say all the right things. He was vegetarian, had been to therapy, had healthy boundaries with his parents, and was a self-proclaimed feminist.
What a score! I thought to myself.
Unfortunately, he also thought it was appropriate to rank potential female hires by how hot they were. He sincerely thought that I’d enjoy hearing about how he and his male coworker — in their male-dominated Italian office, within a male-dominated industry — had added an extra column in their hiring spreadsheet to rank potential female hires as “hot”, “not hot”, or “maybe hot”.

Italy, a country located in Southern Europe, is globally renowned for its rich history, stunning landscapes, delicious cuisine, and vibrant culture. From its iconic historical landmarks to its contributions to art, fashion, and automotive design, Italy continues to capture the hearts and minds of people around the world. In this article, we will explore the various facets that contribute to Italy’s fame and allure.
Italy is often referred to as the cradle of civilization, thanks to its pivotal role in ancient history. The Roman Empire, one of the most influential empires in history, originated here and left behind a remarkable legacy of architecture, law, and governance. Landmarks like the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon stand as enduring symbols of this glorious past.
The Renaissance, a period that marked the rebirth of art, literature, and science, also originated in Italy. Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome became the epicenters of intellectual and artistic achievements. Great minds such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael produced masterpieces that are celebrated worldwide today. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence and the Vatican Museums in Rome house some of the most important works of art in existence, drawing millions of tourists every year.
Italian cuisine is another significant reason for Italy’s fame. It is internationally adored and has heavily influenced culinary traditions worldwide. Dishes such as pasta, pizza, risotto, and gelato are not just staples of Italian food but have become favorites in many countries.
Italy’s culinary scene is incredibly diverse, with each region offering unique flavors and specialties. For example, the rich and hearty dishes of Northern Italy contrast sharply with the fresh and vibrant flavors found in the South. The Sicilian cannoli and Neapolitan pizza are just two examples of Italy’s gastronomic treasures. Food festivals held throughout the country celebrate local produce, further showcasing Italy’s commitment to quality and tradition in cooking.
Italy has long been a leader in the fashion and design industry. Cities like Milan are known as fashion capitals, hosting prestigious events such as Milan Fashion Week. Renowned designers like Gucci, Prada, Versace, and Valentino have transformed the global fashion landscape with their innovative designs and luxurious collections.
In addition to fashion, Italy is home to several iconic automotive brands, including Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Maserati. The country’s passion for automotive engineering and design is evident in its sleek sports cars that symbolize speed and elegance. The annual Mille Miglia race and the Auto e Moto d’Epoca exhibition in Padua further highlight Italy’s deep-rooted love for automobiles.
Italy is blessed with diverse landscapes, from the picturesque villages of the Amalfi Coast to the rolling hills of Tuscany. The stunning scenery is a significant draw for tourists, who flock to experience the natural beauty and charm of Italian regions.
Italy has the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world, with 58 sites that showcase its cultural and natural heritage. From the ruins of Pompeii to the stunning frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, these sites attract millions of visitors every year, eager to immerse themselves in Italy’s storied past.
Italian art has left an indelible mark on the world, influencing countless artists and art movements. Baroque, Renaissance, and Neoclassicism are just a few of the notable art styles that have roots in Italy. The beautiful architecture found in cities like Venice and Rome also demonstrates the profound artistic vision of both past and contemporary architects.
Italy is known for its colorful festivals and lively celebrations that reflect its rich culture and traditions. Events such as Carnevale di Venezia and the Palio di Siena draw both locals and tourists alike, showcasing traditional costumes, music, and dance. These events not only honor Italy’s deep-rooted traditions but also offer a glimpse into the Italian way of life.
The Italian culture is characterized by warmth, hospitality, and a strong sense of community. The Italian way of life emphasizes family values, hearty meals, and leisurely activities. This welcoming nature is often what draws tourists back to Italy time and again, as visitors leave with not just memories of scenic landscapes and historic sites but also of heartfelt connections with the locals.
Some must-visit locations include Rome (the Colosseum, Vatican City), Florence (Uffizi Gallery, Duomo), Venice (St. Mark’s Basilica, Grand Canal), and Milan (Duomo di Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II).
Italian cuisine is popular for its fresh ingredients, simplicity, and variety. Dishes can be easily customized and offer a balance of flavors that appeal to a wide range of palates.
The best time to visit Italy is during the spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) when the weather is mild, and the tourist crowds are relatively smaller.
Yes, Italians value family, social interactions, and meals enjoyed together. It is common to greet friends with a kiss on both cheeks and to enjoy long meals that include multiple courses.
Italy has significantly influenced art, architecture, music, and cuisine. The country is credited with introducing opera, contributing to Renaissance art, and establishing fashion trends that continue to resonate today.
In conclusion, Italy’s fame can be attributed to its rich historical legacy, extraordinary culinary delights, vibrant fashion scene, breathtaking landscapes, and warm culture. Each facet adds to the allure that keeps people around the world enamored with this beautiful country.

There’s a particular kind of silence that follows the clatter of train wheels on tracks. It’s not empty — it hums with promise, like a deep breath held between moments. That’s how it felt while traveling between Florence and Venice, as the Tuscan hills transitioned into marshy, mystical flatlands. I looked out the window and realized the experience wasn’t just a trip. It was a soft reset.
We came to Italy looking for beauty, pasta, and a break from our over-scheduled lives. What we found was something we hadn’t planned for: space. We found space to think, to wander, and to breathe again.
The idea was simple: seven days in Italy, three cities, one Eurail pass, and zero stress. The itinerary included Rome, Florence, and Venice. A golden triangle of beauty, history, carbs, and vino.
Easy, right?
We even had a spreadsheet with color-coded tabs. Arrival times, museum hours, restaurant reservations, walking distances, and estimated energy levels. I had even listed “snack breaks,” as if spontaneity needed a time slot.
Naturally, on our first day in Rome, our Google Maps history resembled a marathon. We chased every “top 10” list. We reached…

Pinch me! Even now, two months after returning from my dream trip, I still can’t believe it happened. I spent almost a month in Italy, shadowing doctors across different cities while also working as a content creator with international brands. Like what?!
Europe was on my travel list for 2027 – literally a far off fantasy because duh, it’s expensive. But somehow, I got there because I dared to send an email. It all started when doctors in italy slid into my inbox, asking me to create a reel for their brand as a part of a paid collab and in the most “main character” moment of my life, I shot back an email like “Umm how about I come and experience your healthcare system first-hand rather than just talking about it from across the oceans?”
And?? To my surprise, they agreed! I was the first Indian content creator they sponsored a trip for. After a test reel that impressed them with my insights, link clicks, and resulting applications, we booked my first-ever business-class flight to Europe – from Kolkata. I couldn’t hold back my emotions. The little kid in me had a teary eye – I was the first in my entire family to apply for a Schengen Visa, the first to fly out of Asia, the first to go on a sponsored trip, and the first to break all those limiting beliefs.

The Magic of Northern Italy: My Journey From Milan to Florence,https://medium.com/@andreaswagner_68972/the-magic-of-northern-italy-my-journey-from-milan-to-florence-407caac22f7c,"Sign up

Last year I went on a month-long journey through the North of Italy. In this article, I want to share some of the highlights that I made on the tour. Additionally, I thought I’d complement my own thoughts with impressions of German writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who visited Italy from 1786 to 1788.
My journey began in Milan, which is the second largest city in Italy after Rome. My first impression of the city was a bit disappointing as I perceived it as quite dirty and ran down. Maybe this was due to the fact that my hostel was located next to the main station, which is not the best area in town.
The hostel itself, however, was very nice. I would do a lot of exploring around the center of the city. Two of the main sites are the Milan Cathedral and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The former was built in 1386, and I highly recommend taking a tour through the Cathedral, including the rooftop.
The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is Italy’s oldest active shopping gallery. It stands out due to its high ceilings, the glass dome in the center, and its luxurious shops and restaurants within the gallery. I found the architecture very fascinating, although it is obviously overrun by tourists.
After a short stay in Bergamo, I headed out to Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliett. Verona has a nice Mediterranean vibe and is home to the Verona Arena, one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheaters.
It was built in 30 AD and is still in use today. Goethe wrote about the amphitheater:
“The simplicity of the oval is palpable to every eye in the most pleasant way, and every head serves as a measure of how enormous the whole is. Now, when you see it empty, you have no measure; you do not know whether it is big or small.”
Although the amphitheater is one of the city’s main attractions, what stood out to me was the general architecture you can find throughout the city. There is a beautiful hill, home to the Castel San Pietro, from which you are able to overlook the city.
Lake Garda, which is easily reachable from Verona, was my next stop. What stood out to me was the panoramic view, with the majestical mountains of the Alps in the background. Goethe was also enraptured by this view:
“How much do I wish that my friends were with me for a moment to enjoy the prospect, which now lies before my eyes. I might have been in Verona this evening, but a magnificent natural phenomenon was in my vicinity — Lake Garda, a splendid spectacle, which I did not want to miss, and now I am nobly rewarded for taking this circuitous route.”
I stayed in a small town called Desenzano del Garda, which is a great hub for exploring the surrounding areas. Even in late October, you are able to enjoy some hours at the lake’s beaches.
My next stop on the list was Venice — a town I have seen so many times in various movies but never in person. So as soon as I left the train station and saw the canal in the beautiful sunshine, I had a big smile on my face. I stayed in a hostel called the Generator, which is located on one of the smaller side islands but offers a great view of the city.
Now, Venice really is a place of its own. You do not need to visit museums or galleries because the city itself is a piece of art. It gained wealth and power between the 9th and 12th centuries and had another very influential phase during the Renaissance. The boats, the houses, the canals. Everything in Venice feels magical, and you could easily believe that the city is a well-constructed theme park.
Note, however, that many tourists are moving through the narrow alleys of which Goethe wrote:
“After dinner, I hurried to first get an impression of the whole, and threw myself (…) into the labyrinth of the city, which, although intersected by canals and small channels, is connected again by bridges and small bridges. One cannot imagine the narrowness and crowdedness of the whole without having seen it.”
After I left Venice and spent one night in Bologna, I headed further south to Florence. Now, if you’re a fan of DaVinci, Michelangelo, or art in general, this city is a must-see! Although I was already a bit tired of the hustling and bustling of all the cities I’d seen, I managed to visit the Uffizi, which hosts one of the most important collections of the Renaissance era.
What I enjoyed even more in Florence was the community kitchen of my hostel — the Yellow Square. Every night a committed group of travelers would gather in the kitchen and share meals and stories of their day. Furthermore, the hostel has a nice rooftop terrace from where you can overlook the city.
Finally, it was time for me to head out into nature. I went to a place called LaVerna — an old, mystical monastery that is located on the top of a mountain. From there, I would start on a week-long pilgrimage along the way of St. Francis, which ultimately led me to the town of his birth, Assisi.

The morning started off with my phone having not charged during the night. Then as we rushed out of the house I realised I had forgotten it.
Fortunately just a minor inconvenience as I’d only gone a few metres before patting my pockets and realising I didn’t have it. But now the battery was low and we needed the phone for our journey. Rail tickets, buying metro tickets, plane boarding passes and Uber on arrival.
This trip was just a short 6 day visit to Italy — 3 days in Rome and 3 days in Florence. The occasion, celebrating the 80th birthday of Roger, our long time round the world travelling companion, who was coming from South Africa to Italy to celebrate his birthday with his family in Venice.
As my phone charge was low I used the time on the train from Aveiro to Porto to charge it. But as I gathered my extra jacket and luggage the phone fell on the floor.
I didn’t realise I didn’t have it until I needed it to pay for the metro tickets. Frantic patting and searching was in vain. It was on the train on the way to Spain!
After explaining my predicament to Sara at the Campanha station ticket office, she immediately contacted…

This past weekend, Italy’s monuments were lit up orange for the #orangetheworld annual campaign sponsored by UN Women and the United Nations on the occasion of the International Day to End Violence against Women.
The initiative was launched by the UN Secretary-General in 2008.
From Milan to Rome, Siena to the Amalfi Coast, many cities in Italy have participated this year. Amazing photos and videos were shared on social media throughout the weekend.
According to Onu Italia, the following cities colored their most famous sites with orange lights:
www.facebook.com
In Rome and around the country, some of the most iconic buildings of the Italian Ministry of Defense also lit up orange.
Across the world, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Italian diplomatic network united on social media to underscore the country’s agenda for protecting and upholding the rights of women and promoting the fight against any form of discrimination and gender-based violence.
“On the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Farnesina wishes to reaffirm its firm commitment to these issues,” reads a message of the Foreign Ministry.
Italy’s engagement rests on the belief that promoting the empowerment of women and girls and fighting against gender-based violence are deeply intertwined.
“By inhibiting the ability of women to enjoy their rights, gender-based violence represents a major hindrance on the road to their empowerment and fulfilment. Likewise, promoting the empowerment of women, based on the recognition of women as political, economic and social subjects, can help to counter violence against them,” the message continues.

In the beginning, there were emails
OMG. What’s happening in Italy? (We were struck early and hard by the COVID19 virus.)
Avoid the fate of Italy.
Are you safe there? (Yes. I live in Umbria.)
Avoid the fate of Italy.
Why is there such a high percentage of people dying? (Combination of an aging population, and the way the statistics were done.)
Avoid the fate of Italy.
Does your town have enough cemetery space to bury all of the dead? (Yes)
Avoid the fate of Italy.
Has the Italian health care system collapsed? (No)
Avoid the fate of Italy.
Is it true no one can get in or out of the country? (For a while yes.)
Avoid the fate of Italy.
Are you under martial law? (No. We voluntarily complied with the law.)
Avoid the fate of Italy.
Don’t you want to come home to the US to feel safe? (No. I feel safe here.)
Avoid the fate of Italy.
And then?

This was originally published on The Unexplorer.
Under the Tuscan Sun. Eat, Pray, Love. If these books are anthems that sing of your dreams of moving to Italy, join the club.
And yet, while many women (myself included) do successfully create a new life in the land of pasta and prosecco, many others return to their homeland after just a few months or years, unable to rectify the dream with the reality of living in Italy.
Before you sell everything you own and buy a one-way ticket, here are a few reasons you might want to reconsider this plan.
I get it. Politics/the economy/[insert something else here] suck where you live. You’re dreaming of escaping the rat race for a better life in Italy.
But I’ll tell you a secret: things aren’t perfect in Italy either. In the south, there’s an extremely high unemployment rate (15% versus a national average of 8.2%). Politics are wonky here too, depending on your leanings. Oh, and then there’s the mafia.
When you run away from what you consider a less-than-ideal life, you aren’t setting yourself up for success in your new home. And as you know, problems follow you.

One of the hardest parts of moving to Rome for me back in 1988 was not having any friends initially. A valuable lesson that I learned was not to become friends with someone just because you share a common language. This can be very tempting, especially if you are feeling isolated and don’t speak the local language well enough to make friends with the locals. When you only have a language in common with another person, these so-called friendships can become very draining and even toxic if you don’t share the same values, political views, or life mindsets. For this reason, unless you are moving to Italy already with an advanced level of Italian, please take the time to study at least 90–120 hours of Italian before you arrive. This will give you a lot of choices when it comes to friendships as well as your ability to move more freely within the culture.
While it’s nice to hang out with other foreigners at expat events, especially those who speak your language, just make sure that they are positive about their lives in Italy. You simply do not have the luxury of hanging out with expats who are constantly hating on Italy and Italians. They will sap your energy and chip away at your enthusiasm for why you moved to Italy. I cannot stress enough how you must leave these individuals alone. Just like you must avoid the moaners, don’t overly focus on the negatives in Italy.
As the old saying goes, any road will get you there, if you don’t know where you’re going. Get a plan and really focus on what you want to achieve in Italy, both personally and professionally. Seek out friends and professional contacts that will support your dreams, goals, and objectives.
I jumped in at the deep end when I moved to Italy in 1988, and looking back now, I can honestly say that I wish I had known much more than I did before I got here. I wish I had known back then how important it was to surround yourself with the right people, and how this would influence how you saw your life in Italy — either as going somewhere or not going anywhere at all.
They say that 95% of where you go in life depends on who you know! If this is true, then get out and do some serious networking. I have enjoyed many expat get-togethers, but to be honest, the most important contacts I have made in Italy for my business have been at 100% Italian events. Make sure you have great looking business cards when you go, and most of all, follow up with the Italians you meet!
The DIY approach to relocating to Italy can sometimes be fraught with problems and challenges. I have sat with grown adults sobbing due to their “workarounds” of the Italian fiscal or immigration system. Make sure, especially if you plan on living in Italy full time, that you network with people who can introduce you to savvy professionals like accountants and lawyers.

Transparency matters: Italy moves against the secrecy surrounding the cost of medicines,https://msf-access.medium.com/transparency-matters-italy-moves-against-the-secrecy-surrounding-the-cost-of-medicines-4468a6e0ced6,"Sign up

How much do medicines cost to develop? The answer to this critical question is that we don’t know. What we do know is that the lack of transparency and secrecy surrounding these costs allows pharmaceutical companies to charge just about any price they want for their drugs. Now Italy has taken a pioneering step in requiring more transparency from the industry.
Currently pharmaceutical corporations are not required to disclose their research and development (R&D) costs, how much public money they receive to help develop medicines, or what prices they charge in different countries.
This means they can — and do — charge sky-high prices and make huge private profits off the back of public investments. The pharmaceutical industry justifies high drug prices by claiming the need to recoup the high costs they invest in R&D. However, they never publicly reveal those figures, preferring to keep us all in the dark about the actual costs involved. Consequently, countries and health systems have to negotiate ‘blind’ with companies while trying to secure an affordable price for medicines to treat their populations.
The last few years have seen escalating drug prices create increasingly global barriers for access to medicines — these price barriers are not limited anymore to people living in developing countries. Cancer drugs, hepatitis C drugs, insulin — sky-high prices for all of the above have created real life and death challenges for people and health systems in rich countries, too. Health systems are buckling under the prices of new medicines everywhere. The public is not getting its money’s worth and pharma has been getting rich at our expense as taxpayers.
Which is why — after some pretty drawn-out and contentious negotiations — there was a cause for celebration at the World Health Assembly back in 2019, when Member States finally adopted a resolution to demand more transparency from pharma over how they price their drugs.
Italy was at the forefront of that initiative in 2019 and today is taking a further important step forward to redress the power imbalance between pharma companies and the public, and require more transparency from an industry that deliberately cloaks itself in secrecy.
August saw the formal approval of a decree from Italy’s regulatory medicines agency (AIFA) that asks pharmaceutical corporations, before any major drugs purchase, to provide the agency with specific information about the company’s R&D costs, as well as the commercial conditions under which the same product is sold in other countries — i.e. the prices the company is charging elsewhere.
The ‘Pricing and Reimbursement’ decree promises to disrupt a system which has allowed for far too long pharmaceutical corporations to impose exorbitant prices on governments for their innovative products, which are more often than not disconnected from actual R&D costs and funded with taxpayers’ money.
Let’s take a closer look at the decree — it requires corporations;
→to demonstrate the ‘added therapeutic value’ of each drug under negotiation — meaning corporations that want to bring a medicine onto the Italian market at higher prices than those of existing treatments, will now have to demonstrate that the new medicine also has increased therapeutic efficacy.
→ to disclose the price at which the drug is sold in other countries — until now, the information about prices in other countries has been ‘protected’ by confidentiality clauses.
→to make public disclosure of the subsidies and public funds received by the corporation towards the R&D costs, as well as disclosure of the overall R&D costs.
→to reveal the status of patents that it holds on the drug.
→and — the icing on the cake — to provide the regulatory authority with annual data on profits and sales of each drug.
“A spectacular ‘win’ for public health”
It’s a spectacular ‘win’ for public health and will undoubtably strengthen the negotiating position of AIFA with pharmaceutical corporations. However, we now need to see the principles on paper turned in to reality.
The task now for AIFA is to define clear means and guidelines for the implementation of the decree. For example, what steps are taken if the corporation does not produce the required documents? Will negotiations be blocked? If this applies for an essential and innovative drug, what consequences could it have on public health? Will AIFA keep its nerve and block negotiations on an essential and innovative drug, given the potential public health consequences of keeping it off the market? And who will verify the reliability of the documents produced by the corporations?
Who will follow in Italy’s footsteps?
There’s a road ahead to travel of course, but the publication of this decree is indeed a pioneering first step. And where Italy has acted, civil society groups elsewhere are now looking on closely, hoping this might encourage other governments to follow suit.
And in a time of COVID-19, there’s no more critical moment to ensure transparency of the costs of drug and vaccine development. Billions of dollars of public investment have already been poured into the race for new vaccines and treatment. We need corporations to come clean on prices and costs, and as well to share clinical data so that fair prices can be set that ensure affordability for everyone — both people in our own projects and others too in need — and that pharma doesn’t use the pandemic as another opportunity to line its pockets. Transparency matters.

Ciao, Italy.
You have started to hold a very special place in my juvenile heart. If there is anything I have ever dreamt of, it is you, Italy. The skies painted in the hues of the Adriatic Sea, the clouds like scoops of vanilla gelato, colorful rumbling vespas like rolling syllables of Italian, men kissed by Michelangelo, women blessed by the Tuscan sun.
I have been fascinated by many places, whom you might know too- UK with its historical charm, France with its elegance and German with its discipline; but there is something unique and different about you, Italy. You can be mandolin in a lively Tarantella on a summer night and the bagpipe in the quiet streets of Rome; and piano is the Ponte Vecchio of these instruments, entwined.
People fall in love with other people in France but I have fallen for you, Italy. It is as if you’ve been sculpted in a way by the divine not to be admired, but to be felt. You have been created for me to awaken long-lost butterflies, the softest goosebumps I thought I’d forgotten. If there is anything I’ve longed for, it has to be you, Italy. I dream to wake up and see your face, feel the morning summer breeze kiss my skin, spending lazy middays penning love letters to you, and dancing in the red-wined soaked air with beautiful souls you’ve wrought.
You fill in the hollow voids of nothingness with ecstasy and a hope, a hope that one day I’ll come to you. I hope to live the sunny daydreams in Tuscany, I hope to eat the best gelatos of my life, I hope to fall for a mark of your splendor, I hope to see Piazzale Michelangelo’s night sky with you, I hope to hear the Basilica’s bells as I pray, I hope to touch the sacred walls as if it’s the divine itself, I hope to smell the different pastas before devouring them, I hope to feel the hurt when I pinch myself, hoping this isn’t a dream.
You aren’t just a place, you’re a promise, a dream, a goal, the perfect end to a happy ending, my happy ending. I promise you that one day, I’ll be coming to you, falling in love more and in your arms. I promise to cry my heart out when I finally meet you, I promise to rediscover the purpose of living there, I promise to unravel all the things you’ve got to say to me, you mysterious gem, I promise to spend my life’s best days there, I promise to never wake up from this dream, I promise to never give up on you, my Italy.   Oh, my unlived déjà vu, I’ll be on my way to you.  One day.   Con amore, Pavitra

Everyone has “a thing” that they do upon their return home from a vacation. Usually, this involves an immense amount of laundry and getting caught up on unread emails.
I similarly follow this trend, except this time. I just returned from Italy, and as soon as I got home, I threw away all of our boxed pasta, canned pasta sauces, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO).
Why?
Because I can clearly taste a difference between prepackaged pasta made with preservatives that I cannot pronounce. I also know that many Italian-sounding olive oils are misleading and not really from Italy at all. The ones I had stocked in my pantry were the kind that I got suckered into buying because it was on BOGO, and I will compare the consistency to motor oil now that I have had the real thing.
During my 10 days touring Italy, I tasted risottos, homemade bread, visited olive farms, gorged myself on homemade pasta, and I even had a four-course meal prepared by the well-known chef Maurizio Staiano of Salerno who has also worked with several Michelin Star Chefs.

Why Saying ‘Arrivederci’ to ‘Careless’ Meat and Cheese is Key to Restoring Italy’s Relationship with Food
I’ll never forget my summer road trip through the land of gastronomy. I spent several days touring Italy’s most fertile agricultural valley. I marveled at the pretty villages with picturesque churches and hilly backdrops. The endless pastures and crop fields. The balmy days of blue skies and t-shirt temperatures. Friendly people at every turn. And the smell of the most delicious food.
No wonder Italy is so widely cited as the world’s number one for cuisine. Whether pizzas, pastas or gnocchi served with a myriad of flavours, Italy seems to have it all.
Italian food engenders an exhilaration like no other; what world-renowned Italian chef, Giorgio Locatelli describes as the “the relationship between food, sex, wine and the excitement of life”.
Except, there was something missing. In my days traversing the fields, valleys and plains of the rich Italian countryside, I never once saw a farm animal outside. It was an irony that has stayed with me ever since.
Where were the cows producing milk for world-famous Parmesan or Grana Padano? Or the pigs renowned for Parma ham? Or the chickens producing eggs for Carbonara?
Quality not quantity
What I discovered is that farmers in Italy’s richest agricultural region had forgotten how to keep animals outside. They simply had a blind spot. They couldn’t see why it wasn’t right to keep them cooped up indoors all day, every day. They couldn’t see the irony of grass being grown then mowed and packed into bales to feed incarcerated cows.
They had lost sight of the fact that cows, pigs, and chickens like to feel fresh air and sunshine as much as we do.
It put me in mind of something else Locatelli once said: “It is better to have fantastic meat once a week than fill ourselves up every day with cheap, carelessly reared meat. We all have to get used to quality, not quantity.”
Famous cheeses
The most surprising discovery on my travels through the Italian countryside was the way dairy cows were kept, not least for those world-renowned iconic cheeses of Parmesan and Grana Padano.
I remember checking the production details for Parmesan and Grana Padano and finding they both mentioned the cows being raised on fresh grass and hay.
But cows wandering the fields, gently tugging at grassy stalks or chewing the cud under the shade of trees, were conspicuous by their absence; the only cows I could find were crammed into darkened sheds.
I remember seeing a hundred cows peering out of a single square shed. They were trapped inside but had a perfect view of the lush pasture they were prevented from grazing on.
I watched incredulously as heavy goods vehicles delivered grass to a processing plant. A yellow tractor scooped grass into a giant machine, while yet more trucks took compacted blocks of grass and drove them away.
Instead of letting the animals graze in a time-honoured fashion, mechanically pressed bales were being produced to feed confined cattle.
What happened to cow paradise?
In what should have been a cow’s paradise, nature’s way had been abandoned.
According to the Grana Padano consortium, 80 per cent of their cows are denied pasture access with approximately 40 per cent confined indoors, not even having outdoor ‘paddocks’.
It reinforced my impression that we now have a generation of cattle farmers in Italy that simply don’t know how to keep animals as nature intended — on pasture.
I wondered whether things were now different for those cows milked for Parmesan — or Parmigiano Reggiano to give its full name. Surely, this ‘king of cheeses’ would be made from the milk of cows that are kept on grass?
Like Grana Padano and many other regional foods, strict rules govern the manufacture of Parmesan. Given its protected status, only cheesemakers from Parma, Reggio Emilia, parts of Bologna, Modena and Mantua can qualify.
My enquiries to the Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano Reggiano, the consortium that governs the manufacture of Parmesan in 2016 resulted in them sharing that the proportion of cows grazing freely in fields for them during the summer months was “very low”.
I was told that there were few exceptions, perhaps as few as one per cent of their farms had cows out grazing. In 2023, I asked them for an update and received no reply.
Known as ‘zero-grazing’ — keeping cows indoors permanently — I subsequently found that it was common practice all over Italy.
As Kees de Roest wrote in The Production of Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese: The Force of an Artisanal System in an Industrialised World, ‘almost all Italian dairy farms apply the zero-grazing system’.
Whilst cows are confined indoors, Italy’s crop fields are often dedicated to growing feed for them rather than food for people.
Unsustainable
About half of Italy’s cereal crop is used to feed intensively reared animals. In addition, the country is a big importer of soya, importing about 3 million tonnes a year, much of which is used to feed industrially reared animals.
Farmed animals are now spookily conspicuous by their absence from the fields and valleys of Italy’s Po Valley.
Which reminded me of those prophetic words by Italian chef, Giorgio Locatelli who warned against eating cheap, carelessly reared meat, saying, “We all have to get used to quality, not quantity.”
Putting quality back on our plate seems the right ingredient for ensuring that Italian cuisine once again reflects that fabled relationship between food, sex, wine and the excitement of life.
Saying ‘arrivederci’ to keeping cows permanently indoors should be a big part of a recipe for nature-friendly food for the future.

Originally written for The Unexplorer.
Every day, I learn something more about my new home in Calabria, Italy. I now laugh at how much I DIDN’T know before I moved to Italy. Hopefully, this post will help you gain a few more nuggets of wisdom if you’re planning to relocate to Italy!
I’ll be in the middle of a deep conversation with a friend or my boyfriend and then the phone rings. 98% of the time, they’ll answer.
While many Americans also keep their ringers on and answer or respond to texts, by far, the Italians have them beat. They will respond no matter what they’re doing. (Do not ask me to elaborate. You can use your imagination here!)
And if they’re the ones calling and if they get no answer, they’ll call again. And again. And again. Italian phone numbers don’t have voicemail, so you can let the phone ring until tomorrow if you want.
This is one frustration I haven’t gotten over. I feel like when you’re with people in person, they should be your focus, not whoever’s calling to shoot the shit.

Italy is my happy place. There are so much to love I don’t know that I can fully articulate them all. I fell in love with this magical country over a decade ago on my first trip to Florence and Rome. For me, there was something that happened when I took that first sip of Italian wine while sitting at a quintessential Italian bistro. For me, it was a sort of spiritual awakening. I didn’t feel like a tourist at all. I felt like I was finally coming home. So much so that when I took my 23 and me test a few years back I was convinced it would come back confirming what I felt in my soul. Turns out I’m only 7% Italian, but one can dream.
Fourteen years and four trips later I am more in love with Italy than I’ve ever been. Every time I leave to come home, I’m already obsessing over when I can go back. Time doesn’t stand still and we can’t ever duplicate an experience though. I’ve learned to embrace this over the years. Because of this, each of my trips to Italy have been dramatically different. So much so that my perspective and appreciation of Italy changes a little each time. I have learned a few simple things during this time that I want to share to make your journey everything it should be.
One of the most spectacular things about Italy is the landscape. You don’t want to miss a minute of it. To miss out on this part of the journey is like missing out on seeing the ocean if you visit the Oregon coast. For this reason, if you’re visiting multiple cities on your trip the only way to do this is by train. Do not; I repeat; do not waste your precious time on a bus. It is by far slower, stinkier, and you miss out on much of the countryside( I know this unfortunately by experience). The train system in Europe is very convenient. I recommend using the app Omio. You can search and purchase tickets from city to city, find the quickest and most inexpensive routes, and then store your tickets right to your I-phone or smart phone. Book a window seat so you can be sure to take in all of the amazing views. Pro tip: Pack lightly and make sure your bags are easily accessible when you disembark the train. This process can get a little bit chaotic, but still so worth it.
Everyone enjoys a summer vacation. School tours, large groups, and just about everyone in between will be in Italy in the summer. For this reason, if you can manage the timing heed my advice when I tell to you go during a non-peak season. Not only will you avoid the stifling heat, you will pay less for pretty much everything, you will get to have some leisure that doesn’t happen when you are battling the summertime crowds. You can enjoy your time in front of the David without waiting in line and then having to fight your way to front just to get a photo. Imagine standing in the middle of St. Mark’s Square in Venice, with only a handful of other tourists ( I have very fortunately experienced this). Or picture yourself standing in the Sistine Chapel without wall to wall people. This is an experience that precious few can say they’ve encountered while traveling in Italy.
While you’re taking time to get in touch with your inner Italian make sure you allow your eyes to move from the map you’re using. Close the navigation on your phone and please get lost. One of the beautiful things about being in a foreign country is allowing yourself to wander. We live in an age of maps and GPS everywhere so I realize this can be challenging. But by putting the directions away you will find that you start to see what’s right in front of you instead of planning how to get to the destination on your mental to-do list. Roaming through the streets of a walled city in Tuscany is something you won’t regret or ever forget. Allow yourself to stumble upon the unique local shops and chat with the friendly Italians. While I agree that some planning is necessary on your journey the real adventure comes when you let yourself drift and soak up the treasures just waiting for you.
Italy is truly a remarkable place. There’s an omnipresent feeling that you’re surrounded genius works of art and culture. I challenge you to visit and enjoy, but always save a little bit to explore on your next trip. I do hope that your journey allows you get in touch with a little bit of your Italian and keeps you coming back for more. You won’t regret the views from the train. You’ll not want to miss any of the Italian wine while you eat the best pasta of your life. And don’t forget to find yourself on a street that you hadn’t planned on visiting, soaking up a view that you didn’t realize was waiting for you.

Italy has to be on everyone’s travel shortlist — and, for a long time, it was on mine as well. It’s a destination like Paris or London or Tokyo that fills people with wonder and has an iconic feeling thanks to Hollywood and everyone’s brag-worthy Insta shots.
I can’t say why we hadn’t made it to Italy yet. We’ve been working our way through Europe country-by-country, mainly as add-ons to my work trips. There are other places I’ve gravitated towards first because they have been a bit higher on my list. We also took a massive three-week trip in 2013, and while we went to Portugal and Spain, Italy didn’t make the cut.
But I happened to have a work trip to Zurich for The Company in December, and since we did Denmark and Sweden the following year in November and froze to death, we decided to go south this trip and finally check Italy off of the list.
Italy was disappointing.
That’s not a popular sentiment. I’m dear friends with many Italophiles, and I love them and trust their opinions, but I’ve since learned that I don’t have to love all destinations equally. And Italy just isn’t my jam.
I tried to break this down into broader categories, and I realized that there are a few things that I look for when I travel:
Order: If we think about a continuum from order to chaos, I’m a lover of order. I find that chaotic places can be somewhat anxiety-triggering, but beyond that I find a smoother travel experience when it’s easy to get from A to B and when people know how to queue in lines in an orderly fashion. Even if it’s not the structure that I know, I’m happy to stand back and observe the rules and adapt to them.
Politeness: A close cousin to order is the politeness of the people in individual interactions. Are people open and kind? Do they hold doors, try to stay quieter at night, or stand up to give seats on transit for expectant mothers? When you treat someone with respect, do they respond in kind?
Warmth: How welcome do you feel, even if you are different? Do people welcome you into their lives and their families? One country that feels incredibly warm to me is Mexico — just pull up a chair and join the family! You are welcome no matter who you are and feel that people genuinely care about you.
History/Culture/Stuff to Do: This is actually the easiest requirement of all because I find so many things interesting! I can find something interesting in almost any place.
[Note: One huge exception here is camping. I don’t camp. I hate it and I refuse to spend my vacation doing something I can’t stand. So if camping is the attraction, or the accommodation, I’m out.]
So when I step back and think about my favorite trips I’ve ever taken, it’s not surprising that they would score highly across the board. If I were to rate my favorites, the top three thus far are Australia, Austria, and Hawai’i. Each of these is quite different, with different things that attract me, and each has their own detractions (scary creatures, weather, humidity, excess sand, etc.), but they are places that have a good orderliness, polite and warm people, and interesting cultural sites and activities.
The big attraction to Italy was the culture and the history. It’s the freakin’ Roman empire — how amazing to visit a society that was such a powerhouse for a thousand years! So when I think about the highlights of our visit to Rome and Florence, these cultural attractions made the biggest impression on us.
But Italy did not score so well in the categories of order, politeness, and warmth. Whenever I mention this to an Italophile they express one of two things. First, they might express regret that I didn’t experience the Italy that they love (one dear friend said, “Well, by the fifth or sixth time Italy is amazing!” which made me laugh that I’d have to do four more trips like this to discover the charm of the place). And I can see that this could be true because there were pockets of warmth. There was the amazing B&B host in Florence who gave us a mini walking tour around the B&B and kept adding recommendations to our map (to the point that I kept feeling bad that he was taking up so much time). We had some very kind servers at some of the restaurants in Rome, especially those we visited in the Jewish quarter.
But this was not a country filled with politeness or order. It felt a lot like Portugal — a city that was once great but that was, quite literally, in decay. I found the Italians en masse to be loud, pushy (literally) and rude. Sometimes their aggression is well-served — say, in the way that they drive — but in other cases it just seemed misplaced.
I have some empathy for what Romans must experience, living in a city that every idiot tourist in the world wants to visit. They tromp off of their air-conditioned coaches in khaki shorts and big white tennis shoes, stopping in the center of the sidewalk to unfurl their maps or position their selfie sticks. I get it. These are the same idiots that show up in Seattle in June, July, and August.
What frustrates the crap out of me is that we work very, very hard to not be that kind of tourist. I’ve found that learning some of the local language can be incredibly helpful. I’ll never forget my first trip to France with some friends. One of them refused to say “Bonjour” when we entered shops, instead saying “HI!” in a super-American accent. Greetings are one of the simplest ways to show respect of other cultures — it doesn’t take more than 30 minutes to learn five basic phrases in a language, and now that we have the Internet, there’s no excuse!
When it came to Italian, I spent two months learning a bit more than the basics on DuoLingo. Yes, it did help a little, but in most cases it helps grease the skids for moments of connection. Not in Italy. Not at all.
Two other simple adjustments we make when we travel is in the way that we dress and the way that we behave in public. If you’ve ever been on a train in Germany or a flight in Sweden you’ll notice how quietly people converse, mindful of the shared spaces that they are in. These are places where one doesn’t need to draw attention to oneself through behavior or dress. Dressing for the road is actually rather simple — we wear clothing that is classic and plain, or in muted patterns (like stripes, small checks, or small florals). We ditch the clothes with words and jokes and logos to go for the pan-European look. Because of how we look physically people are often unsure where we’re from (no one ever guesses Mexico for Sergio!), and because of this we can “pass” for different nationalities. The best compliment to me when traveling in Europe is for someone to think I am Swiss or German (but I’ll take Canadian!), and I take a lot of joy when I say that I am American — just one who is considerate in other countries!
All of this amounted to nothing in Italy. No amount of blending behavior worked at all. Maybe that’s because we weren’t blending with the culture? But even if you can’t blend, I had hoped there would be some appreciation that we weren’t obnoxious.
In the end, I think my experience of traveling in Italy was very much like my travels to New York City. It’s not popular to say this, but I’m not a fan of NYC. Sure — there are lots of things to do and see. I love the museums and the shows and the food. But it entirely lacks in charm and warmth, not to mention trees (I’ll give Rome this — they do have some trees here and there).
One last note, and that’s food. Food might be the fifth category, if there is one. My opinion on food has changed since I’ve modified my diet (no dairy plus I follow a modified version of the FODMAP diet) — I’m interested in the local cuisine, but in some countries the choice foods aren’t something I can eat. Italy is a great example — most pizza and pasta is covered in cheese, a big no-no for me.
I admit that we sinned big one night and had lasagna, which was delicious and worth the stomachache. Italian food was good, but since it’s widely available, there wasn’t much about it that felt so special that I could only get it there. This is different than some other cuisines where it is very difficult to get authentic cuisine outside of the place. Have you ever had amazing barramundi in the US? What about perfect shave ice outside of Hawai’i? Or flødeboller outside of Scandinavia? Or perfect spaetzle and strudel outside of Bavaria?
So that’s that. Italy turned out to be a bit of a bomb for me. We don’t have any upcoming work trips planned to Europe, but we do have a big trip planned in the spring! For something completely different, we’re going to Norway, Estonia, and Finland! To say that I’m excited is an understatement. A fair bit of my heritage is Norwegian (with a bit of Swedish and Finnish thrown in for luck), so I’m excited to visit Norway in particular. We’ve also visited both Denmark and Sweden, and while the Scandinavians aren’t the warmest people when you first meet them, those countries score off-the-charts on order, politeness, and history! I’m going to start learning basic Norwegian phrases next month!
Ciao for now, Sarah

After 15 years of transcontinental trips, I finally accomplished my goal of visiting all 20 regions of Italy (magically, just before the pandemic hit). I will continue to return over and over, as there is so much more to see and do and learn, but in this blog series I look back, through the rear-view mirror, and share some of the highlights I discovered along the way — One region at a time.
Piedmont sits in northwest Italy, bordered by France and Switzerland, as well as by the Italian regions of Aosta, Lombardy, and Liguria. As its name suggests, Piedmont lies at the foot (pie) of the mountains (monte). Italy’s second largest region, it is surrounded by mountains on three sides and is home to many of the highest peaks and largest glaciers in Italy. The landscape is incredibly diverse, from rugged peaks to rolling hills covered with vineyards, to rice fields and plains.
Turin is the regional capital, was the first capital city of Italy, and for centuries before that was the heart of the Kingdom of Savoy. Not surprising, the city is rich in history and culture. A mix of elegant Baroque, Neo-classical and Art Nouveau architecture (more reminiscent of Paris and Vienna than Rome and Naples), combined with broad, portico-lined streets, sets its historic centre apart. Many of Italy’s more traditional medieval centres that I have visited (e.g., Florence, Siena, Bologna) tend to have narrow, haphazard streets, and stocky Romanesque architecture. The differences are striking
My experiences in Piedmont (Piemonte) centred around Turin, where I spent 2 weeks during the World Masters Games (2013) and Monferrato, where I spent 3 weeks working at a winery and agriturismo (2019). I also felt compelled to return to both place in 2021, to reconnect with friends from my earlier visits. My eyes were opened wider with each visit.
La Casaccia Agriturismo and Winery sits about an hour east of Turin. For some background, I was at La Casaccia as a volunteer, working in exchange for room and board (part of an exchange program called WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms that I highly recommend for anyone who wants an authentic Italian experience). For me it was a way to extend my stays in Italy without breaking the bank, to practise my Italian and, as much as possible, to live like a local. Mission accomplished!
I chose La Casaccia for several reasons. A major draw was its location in Piedmont, a region I wanted to spend more time exploring. The fact that La Casaccia was a B&B /agriturismo as well as a winery was also appealing, as I was sure to learn more as I helped out in the variety of activities. It turned out to be an amazing experience with a wonderful host family. I did everything from preparing breakfast for B&B guests to working in the garden and kitchen (where I learned some local recipes), to working in the cellars and vineyards (helping prepare for and participate in the vendemmia, or wine harvest, as well as in the production process for the various organic wines they made). I loved every minute of it, and my return visit 2 years later felt like a family reunion.
While at La Casaccia, I also had the luxury of exploring the area on electric bikes the family owned. Something I highly recommend if you get the chance, particularly since the area is quite hilly. The vineyard landscapes of Langhe Roere and Monferrato that I biked through are a designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Piedmont is a spectacular region of Italy. My visits offered just a glimpse of what it has to offer. Click here for more information about Piedmont and here for information on the Monferrato wine region and its wines.
I look forward to hearing from you about your highlights from Piedmont, whether you are a travel enthusiast, lover of Italy, reader, writer (or all of the above!) and especially about your experiences getting off the trodden path and seeing Italy from all its amazing angles. For more about my experiences through other regions of Italy please check back for new posts. You can also check out my website Susan J Bocock Author

Oh, Italy. Your vast landscapes, rich history and culture, gorgeous architecture and inexpensive cappuccinos, how I love thee. Before taking a week long roadtrip through Italy, I had expected nothing but bliss. While there was definitely bliss, there were quite a few roadblocks (like, literally.) Now that I know the quirks of traveling in Italy, my next trip there will probably look completely different, and I want to make sure that you’re set up for success for your own trip! From start to finish, here’s everything you need to know about traveling in Italy from Milan to the Amalfi Coast.
Where to Stay
When asking what most millennial’s would want from a travel guide, most of my Instagram followers said, “budgeting tips!” Obviously, where to stay takes up a significant portion of your traveling budget. That being said, I definitely suggest booking Airbnb’s on your trip in Italy if you are looking for a cost-effective experience. Here are some ways to make the most out of your #AirbnbExperience.
Not all Airbnb’s are created equal: Something I didn’t know is the difficulty of finding and entering Italian Airbnb’s. I’m sure there are areas in Italy where newer apartments/homes are available, however, NOT SO with where we stayed. Keep in mind that the buildings in Italy are, well, ancient. It is rare to find an elevator in apartment/condo buildings, and even if you do, it might be the kind that you have to manually open and close the doors of and still hike up a floor (yes, this happened.)
Prepare to sweat: If running AC is a dealbreaker for you in the summer (like it is for most people), make sure to select “Air conditioning” in Airbnb’s search options. If you don’t, you might end up trying to decide whether it’s a good idea to sleep naked with all the windows wide open all night. In the winter, this wouldn’t pose as much of an issue, since it is quite nice in the evening, but if you opt for a non-AC equipped unit in the summer just to save a few bucks, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Your host WILL meet with you and it MIGHT be awkward: A funny detail about Italy is that most Airbnb’s are run like hotels. Families own entire floors of old apartments and rent them out. That being said, check-in won’t be done solo. Unlike America, where your host will typically hide the key, wish you goodluck and not speak to you until they leave you a *fingers-crossed* kind review, Italians greet you at the street corner, will carry your bags, walk with you to the apartment, then sit with you in the living room giving you local tips. At first, this made me uncomfortable. After realizing how absolutely crucial it is to travel with a local’s tips, I looked forward to each check-in process. Don’t hurry them out, listen to every last word like it’s your religion.
Travel tax is often not included in the cost: Prepare to pay between €1–2 per person per night* at each place you stay. It’s often not included in the Airbnb cost so have euros readily available at every location. Also, prepare for your host to snap a photo of your ID or Passport. This alarmed me at first, but it is actually Italian law to report your guests to the government with their valid ID. Who knew?
*This cost maxes out after three days in one location. If you hop around Italy every few days staying in different locations, it will renew and you’ll need to pay the tax at each location.
Transportation
My favorite flight tracking site is SkyScanner, second favorite is the app Hopper. Watch flight costs and book when it’s low, then plan to travel in Italy one of two ways: public transportation or rent a car.
Car rental: If you’re absorbing the cost of more than one person (like, if you’re married, OR have the option to split travel costs with friends) it’s cheaper overall to rent a car. Tolls were around €200, the rental itself was €700, and we chose a diesel car so that every tank of gas would take us farther. We were crossing a country border, so it’d cost around that just to get to one location in Italy for both of us. However! I do not suggest driving in Italy. You might save overall, but the time wasted trying to find parking, (and in some places, paying for parking) is not easy. If you rent a car in Italy, each driver will require an Italian driver’s permit. You can acquire one at your local AAA office in the US for $20. (To my knowledge, you can not acquire one once you are overseas.)
Trains, trams, and busses: Get to Italy by plane and there will be a train station either underneath or within walking distance of any airport. Get a pass that covers the duration of your stay and you’re set. Trams and busses are optional depending on location, so I wouldn’t plan ahead for these. Depending on how many locations you visit, this is probably the best option for you. I can’t guarantee what your overall cost would be, but if you’re a solo traveler it’s most definitely the way to go.
How to Pack Light
The easiest way to pack light is by following the capsule wardrobe rules. My favorite capsule wardrobe concept is the 10x10 wardrobe created by Lee Vosberg of the Style Bee Blog. Here are the rules: pick any 10 items (not including accessories or jewelry) from your current closet and style those items into 10 different looks. Easy! The basic formula is choosing 4 tops, 2 bottoms, 1 dress, 2 shoes, 1 top layer. Pay attention to the local weather (duh) when packing, and look for inspiration by searching the #10x10Friends hashtag on Instagram!
After the fun things are packed, don’t forget the boring yet completely necessary things. If your luggage is full, purchase a space saver bag to secure your clothing in—it really will save you tons of space inside your luggage!
Budgeting
Budgeting for travel begins way before you book the flight or get on the plane.
My overall rule for budgeting is based on the rules of minimalism. I spend on experiences, not things. I don’t buy what I don’t need, and I think about purchases long and hard before taking the plunge. If traveling is a desire or a goal for you, sacrifice has to come from somewhere. Think of the person you see online constantly traveling. Unless they’re a total baller or just racking up credit card debt, the money being spent has been saved for that moment. They’re sacrificing in one area so that they can experience life more fully in another. So, stash your cash monthly toward a traveling fund rather than letting it slowly drain from your bank account simply because it’s there and available.
Additionally, don’t overspend on your zero-transaction fee credit cards (I’m really pushing for these) while you’re abroad. Stay in line with your routine budget**. It’s easy to get carried away, but painful once all those swipes reveal themselves on your monthly statement.
Overall, I can’t tell you what to or not to buy. That’s ultimately up to you. But I can advise you to evaluate your “must have/see/do’s” and ditch the things that don’t actually interest you. If it’s not your thing, don’t go to a museum because everyone tells you to, don’t rent a beach chair because I tell you to, don’t wait in line or take a tour of a monument that everyone posts on Instagram but you could care less about. See the places you want to see with your own eyes, not the eyes of your friends, family, coworkers, etc. Clearly define your traveling desires before lift-off and your life on-the-road will be easier.
**If you don’t have a routine budget, I highly suggest starting here!
Now, to the fun part! Find Airbnb, restaurant, and budgeting suggestions below for each location we visited in Italy!

Where to Stay: I highly suggest staying in this Airbnb. This is one of the locations that is run like an actual bed and breakfast and is literally steps from the ocean and “new town” center.
Where to Eat: You won’t need to search very far for delicious eats. Down the main street of old and new town, you’ll pass at least thirty shops offering two cappuccinos and croissants for no more than €6. Eat at these spots during the day and save the ones below for your evening dining!
€: Fornaio Di Monterosso
€€: Bar Davi
€€€: Torre Aurora, L’Ancora della Tortuga
What to Wear: After one hour in the sun you will shed all your clothing and end up in the ocean. Wear your swimsuit, throw on shorts and a tank and call it a day. In the evening, wear something light and comfortable for dinner. You’ll see people dressed up for dinner, so if you plan to bring an outfit that makes you feel fancy when sipping on your cocktail of choice.
Local Tips: This is truly a hang out at the beach all day, shop at the mini-markets and eat your weight in seafood kind of place. The way to really enjoy it is by getting up early and snagging an umbrella by the shore while you can. The cheapest spot is right outside the Beach Bar Stella Marina. (It costs €30 for two chairs and an umbrella for the entire day.) You can purchase the spot and it’s yours until after the sun sets! Leave your towels and wander around when it’s too hot to tan, grab a bite to eat, grab some souvenirs, then come back and take a nap in the shade. If you plan to be there for a few days, get a train ticket (the train stops literally right smack by the ocean in the center of “new town”) for the duration of your stay so that you can hop around to the other four towns in the Cinque Terre, because Monterosso is only one of five!
Budgeting: The nice thing about Monerosso al Mare is that you can count on spending around €50 per day, umbrella included (if you’re not counting the Airbnb cost.) Street food is delicious and ridiculously inexpensive. Get your fill on €1 cappuccinos, croisants and gelato, then treat yoself at dinner. Budget a little extra for shopping and alcohol and you’re good to go. Side note: You can get a bottle of wine at dinner for only $18, soooo, yeah, you’re gonna wanna get that.
ROME
Where to Stay: This Airbnb was gorgeous but difficult to enter and the AC wasn’t fantastic. But it was right smack in between Vatican City and the Colosseum, so we didn’t have to spend money on transportation. If you’re able-bodied (keep in mind that you must climb a flight of stairs after taking a manual elevator) and don’t mind waiting for the air to cool down, book this Airbnb for its charm and location. If not, find one with AC and easy entry in the surrounding area.
Where to Eat: We were only in Rome for one day, but each of these spots were to die for. These are a MUST when in Rome.
€: Da Simo Pane e Vino, Pergamino Caffè, and best gelato in Rome, Della Palma!
€€: II Corallo
What to Wear: Rome is hot in the summer. Like, real hot. The locals are extremely fashionable, but they’re also adjusted to the heat, so, not sure where I land on this one. Use your own discretion. I do suggest comfortable sneakers, though, since you’ll be on foot all day.
Local Tips: Assuming you’re visiting Rome to see Vatican City, The Colosseum, etc. prepare to spend a half day or more at each location. Drink lots of water and prepare to pay to use any public restroom! Have euros on hand, always!
Budgeting: This location is hard to indicate a set budget for because everyone’s preferences are different. But things you can keep in mind: most everything to see has a fee, coffee and pastries are cheap as they are everywhere in Italy, a fine lunch/dinner can cost anywhere from €8–30 per person, and bottles of wine at dinner are CHEAP.
AMALFI COAST
Where to Stay: Our Airbnb was an absolute dream. We were a short bus ride away from central Amalfi and just down the road from a cafe, beach, and a few restaurants. This specific location is on the side of a cliff. Dreamy, but takes a quick downward hike to get to since there aren’t elevators on the sides of mountains.
Where to Eat: Surprisingly, we only ate two meals in Amalfi. One dinner, and one “breakfast”, which was actually just a croissant and a cappuccino (the only way to do breakfast in Italy!) The restaurant is, shockingly, not on maps and I can’t even remember the name. However, if you walk around in the city-center long enough, you’ll find a spot. This is the type of place to leisurely walk around and land upon a spot that captures your attention!
What to Wear: I was genuinely surprised to realize that this is not as much of a “beach town” as I’d expected. This is more of a luxurious, million-dollar-making, yacht-owning, white-elitist’s playground than a beach bum’s paradise. If you want to keep up, dress up. If not, don’t. I personally walked around in a swimsuit and shorts all day with my hair in a bun and my face red hot from the sun. But that’s just me.
Budgeting: Ironically, this specific city isn’t overwhelmingly expensive unless you’re staying in one of the high-end resorts. The food is cheap, the beach is free, you can get a few inexpensive bus tickets to take you to local cities like Praiano, Positano and Naples. However, if you’re not hopping from town to town and you’re not the stay-in-our-Airbnb-all-day type, you might run out of things to do. The city-center is beautiful to walk through, but isn’t very large, so keep that in mind when choosing to visit this city or not.
CAPRI
Where to Stay: We stayed in Amalfi—we took the ferry to Capri early one morning and returned later that afternoon.
Where to Eat: We only ate one meal in Capri, and it wasn’t great, so I won’t mention its location. However, try to find a restaurant off the beaten path because it will be less touristy, better priced and much more delicious. One that was suggested to us by our boat tour skipper was La Canzone Del Mare!
What to Wear: Pretty much everyone is in their swimsuits with a cover-up since the only things to do here are go swimming, boating, tan, drink, and eat. P.S. the sun is HOT so make sure to pack an eco-friendly, organic sunscreen.
Budgeting: Ferries to and from Capri will cost you €40 per person, a tour to the Blue Grotto varies between €15–35, a private boat tour will cost you around €180, and the food is between €12–30 per plate. You’re looking at a wild day of spending but a mind-blowing array of beauty, so, soak it up!
FLORENCE
Where to Stay: I am not joking when I say that the Duomo is in full sight from this Airbnb. It is steps from the city-center and is equal distance from all the areas you will want to visit.
Where to Eat:
Breakfast/Brunch: Le Vespe Cafe is a zero-waste cafe located in Florence! This place really made my whole day. Their cappuccinos are amazing, too!
Dinner: Osteria dei Centopoveri is a Tuscan restaurant and pizzeria, so any budget will work here! Their pizza and calzones are huge and delicious, so you’ll definitely want to visit more than once! Make sure to order a bottle of local wine—you can score an entire bottle of Tuscan wine for only €15 and they’ll cork it for you to take home if you don’t finish it!
Gelato: If you don’t get gelato from Grom, were you even in Florence? It’s literally rated the best gelato in Florence, so, don’t miss out. (The best two-scoop mix is chocolate and grom flavor!)
Cocktails: Jazz Club Firenze is one of the top rated spots for drinks and vibes in Florence. Unfortunately, they were closed for holiday when we visited, but if you are in Florence when they are open, you’ve gotta stop by and tell us how it is!
What to Wear: Florence in the summer is quite warm! This is becoming an Italian trend, eh? If you’re exposing skin (which I recommend, because seriously, it’s HOT) lather up in sun-screen. From there, you can pretty much wear anything. Florence is a stylish city but what’s important is being comfortable, since you’ll be on foot all day.
Budgeting: Everything historic has a fee, including the Medici gardens. Unless you’re ready for a hot hike around the garden, skip it and climb to the top of the Duomo, see the Medici Villas, and visit the museums, instead. You’re looking at spending between €50-€100 per person for a day or two of historic venturing. Other inexpensive restuarants are around every corner, you just have to look for them!
MILAN
We were only in Milan for lunch since we passed through it on the way back to Switzerland, but our one suggestion is a good one.
Where to Eat: Do not leave Milan without visiting Lùbar! This is closer to the €€€ scale, since the plates are small, made to share, and they recommend ordering four or more per person. But, wow, the food and drinks are jaw-dropping good.
Okay, guys. That’s it! Did I miss anything? Is there anything you have questions about that you’d like more info on? Let’s chat! Shoot me a DM on Instagram at any time and let’s plan your next adventure!

So what happens when you land up in the capital of a country, which would have welcomed you with open arms had you not uttered those deadly words right at the onset: “Sorry, I don’t speak Italian!”Well, you will definitely be frowned at, ignored, unanswered or just be left on your own - which I am sure nobody would prefer in a vibrant space such as Italy.You can make sure to begin your conversation with at least “Scusi” (Excuse Me— formal) or with a minimal salutation like “Buongiorno” or “Buonasera”. Then, perhaps, you could proceed to tone down your actual question in English by using cue words in Italian, like “toilette” (Italians prefer the french word to their own “bagno” in reference to the washroom) “piazza” or “pizzeria” “ristorante”, so that the local Italian understands quickly what you are referring to.Don’t be afraid to use Italinglish: “scusi, where is “ristorante”?” or something even shorter: “Scusi, toilette?” which will be taken more into consideration than your English version.
Italians like being elaborate when they give directions, as for everything else in life. Be patient and say “Scusi, non parlo italiano!” (Sorry, but i don’t speak Italian!) which is a table turner. This will immediately make an average Italian rush to your help even if their English is not so good. You must not, however, ever point out to an Italian that their English is not up to the mark! Praise them if you must, criticize them never. And you never know, this might be a great start to a cross-border friendship.You see, Italians take an instant liking to you if you express any sort of interest in their culture and language; they are extremely protective, just like any culture where multiple languages and dialects are spoken, about their native tongue. You’d be surprised to know that some of their dialects are full fledged languages in themselves, and equally diverse are their traditions which vary greatly from north to south.
Having learnt and then having taught the language to Indians – I have had the possibility of meeting many Italians. And I have always felt they might have, a soft spot for India and Indians in general – because in a way they are as multi-hued as us and they relate to our cultural diversity. So for them an Indian with even a basic knowledge of their language comes across as someone very “figo” (an informal slang for “cool”)!
But that is true for anyone who lands in Italy with a basic knowledge of Italian – you’ll be befriended at the bar, at the ristorante, in the tassi, in the underground metropolitana, the autobus faster than you can imagine. Don’t be overwhelmed, and don’t shy away from engaging with each one as you go. The more you chat, the more you will enjoy this land of wonders.
One last advice: If you really want to enjoy your first, and many more trips to this architecturally and scenically beautiful space – you better have your hellos, thank yous and wows in order (“Ciao” “Grazie” and “Che Bello!”)!So with the first cultural contact established, hope you have a Buon Viaggio in Italia!

A few weeks back we asked our followers on Twitter what they think are some of the most loved destinations in Italy. The response was quite incredible.
“This will probably be the easiest question I get to answer all day,” writes one of our followers after telling us that his favorite destination is Capri, in the Campania region.
Others mentioned their heritage and origins: “Costa Smeralda, Sardegna,” writes Jonathan, mentioning that his mother is from Santa Teresa di Gallura.
And others admitted “it’s too hard to choose,” as writes Darlene, whose favorite destinations are Pienza in Tuscany, and Capri and Positano in Campania. “So tough to choose,” says Ishita, mentioning Montestigliano in Tuscany.
Kevin didn’t write anything, but responded with a beautiful photo of Florence.
Here are some additional destinations that our Twitter followers highlighted, from small towns to large areas who every year attract tourists from the US and around the world: Amalfi Coast, Budelli Island, Crotone, Guardia Snaframondi (Benevento), Lucca, Monte Argentario, Napoli, Porto Santo Stefano, Salento, Sicily, Taormina.
In March, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) said that overall, the total contribution of the travel and tourism industries to the Italian economy was €223.2 billion in 2017, once all the direct, indirect and induced benefits were taken into account. The report mentioned that, not only Italy is the 6th largest travel economy in the world, but the industry supported 3.4 million jobs in 2017 with an estimate of 4 million jobs by 2028.
So, what is your favorite destination in Italy?

When I embarked on my Italian wine journey nearly three years ago, I could have never imagined having to face a worldwide health crisis here in Italy, or anywhere, for that matter.
Rather than recount grave tales of the current quarantine situation, I wanted to share what I’ve only now realized my fellow Italian citizens have taught me.
It’s been said a million times before, but now, more than ever, we need to remember that we cannot predict or control every aspect of our lives. As an American, this is something I’ve found very hard to accept. Living amongst a population of people who contrastingly seem to embrace unpredictability, has shed a spotlight on my inability to do so.
From my first days working on a beautiful vineyard in central Italy, I wanted to know exactly what I’d be doing when. I’d inquire about lunchtime, dinner time, and my future tasks for the upcoming week, often met by quizzical and unspecific replies. “We’ll pause for lunch when we’re done with these rows”, pointing to an undefined plot of vines, or “when we pick enough Trebbiano for today,” the winemaker would tell me.
Gone were the days of living confined to my office calendar, handcuffed to the rigid meetings, scheduled a month or more in advance. Countless more examples in the Italian countryside, as well as in my current city of Bologna, reinforce that Italians innately embrace the present, instead of wasting time obsessing about the future.
This take-things-as-they-come mindset has proven very beneficial in combating hysteria and fear during these now uncertain times of Coronavirus. Italy and the majority of its people are not overly panicking about tomorrow or being frightened by media reports from abroad.
Despite exaggerated accounts, Italians are not hoarding groceries and fighting in stores, as I’ve witnessed with every prediction of 6 inches of snow in the U.S. They focus their energy on dealing with the day at hand, taking time to prepare for the next, but never forgetting to find a few minutes to laugh and be grateful to be alive.
Unless of course, we’re talking about a football (soccer) match, Italians have shown me that life is much more than a series of back-to-back competitions. In America, we are groomed for competition from birth — just look at the insanity surrounding pre-school admissions. Parents in many parts of the US are forced to apply for pre-school the moment their child is born, in fear of being left out in the cold once their child approaches school-age — 3 years later.
From elementary school through high school, the competition only increases with each passing year. Immense pressure is put on students to outperform one another, gain entry to the highest classes, most prestigious clubs, teams, and of course colleges. Pre-SATs, SATs, state proficiency exams, and class-rankings pit every student against each other, creating tremendous anxiety and comparisons amongst impressionable teenagers.
In the US, very rarely are students encouraged, or afforded the time, to help one another succeed. Instead, they are told to focus on grades, activities, transcripts and overall peer-group standing. Fierce competition for the few coveted spots at elite and popular universities drives an inordinate amount of stress and do-whatever-it-takes approach. Parents and students resort to insane, sometimes illegal, measures to gain advantages and excel above the next student. Only now, are people finally being held accountable for admissions cheating scandals.
This cut-throat competition and dog-eat-dog mentality does not permeate society in Italy or most parts of Western Europe. Many factors contribute to this of course, but one major reason is that most European universities are public and accessible to all citizens, for free, or very little money. It’s been truly eye-opening to see how much this one difference can affect a nation’s culture and mindset of its society.
In Italy, children and teenagers can grow up without the looming fear of college admissions hanging above their heads. I’d argue, this results in Italians being less individualistic and hostile towards one another, from an early age. Family values are emphasized instead of GPAs, and more time is spent cultivating relationships and passing on priceless traditions. Additionally, students generally dedicate more time to their passions, communities, and appreciation of the arts.
Consequently, many Italian adults have numerous “job titles”, such as a lawyer by day, cheesemaker by night. It’s also common for people to work across various industries, instead of being pigeonholed into one. The freedom that comes with guaranteed higher education creates more opportunities to become successful in a field of your choosing, rather than a field that can most-efficiently pay off $100k+ student debt — as is often the case in America.
While competition is, of course, healthy, especially in business, I think we Americans often forget that life itself is not a competition. We must strive for meaningful lives — not only aim for high test scores, job-titles, and bank accounts, simply to out-shine the next person.
Italy’s economy is far from perfect, however, living in this country during good times, and recent times of difficulty has proven to me that quality of life defines a country much more than its GDP. Italians have come together to face this crisis as a unified and optimistic society, something I’m very proud to be a part of, now, more than ever.
#Andràtuttobene — Everything will be alright.

We’ve learned to enjoy the “hub and spoke” approach to travel. We pick a hub town to stay several days and then plan day trips out from there. That way, we immerse ourselves in one location and aren’t moving every other day. This style of travel provides a more comfortable, relaxed pace.
A good hub is an interesting town located in the center of an area with sights around it. You’re looking for a spot that allows you easy day trips to other locations. We picked general areas and then zoomed in to look for interesting Airbnb possibilities.
We’ll land in Venice at Marco Polo Airport and take a shuttle to the rental car place. I used Kayak to find quotes and make a reservation. We didn’t need a big car (and good luck driving one on tiny European roads anyway). Plus, gas is expensive. I’ve read Italian drivers are intense but at least we’ll be on the familiar side of the road. If we can drive in Ireland, we can drive anywhere.
We’ll do a counter-clockwise circuit through northern and central Italy beginning in the hill town of Feltre. That will provide us a base to explore the Dolomites in the Italian Alps. Then we’ll head west to Torno on Lake Como and south to the Cinque Terre on the Mediterranean. We’ll then go southeast into Tuscany to a village near Siena before finishing for a week back in Venice.
We’ve used Airbnb to stay in unique homes across Germany, Ireland and the US. Often, the prices are much lower than hotels, especially as you add more people. Plus, you get a whole place to yourself, lots of privacy, more bathrooms and a kitchen for cooking. Most importantly, you’re more integrated into the everyday life of the place you’re visiting.
We use search filters to specify we’re looking to rent an entire place plus request key amenities like Wifi, washing machine and the number of beds/baths we need. The calendar for each place shows availability.
You can rate and review places you’ve stayed. You’re also rated by the renters as a guest. It’s a self-monitoring system similar to eBay. You converse with the owner directly and can negotiate the price, especially if you stay multiple days (another reason to hub and spoke your trip).
The village of Feltre in the Veneto is our first hub. It’s located about an hour-and-a-half drive north of Venice with the Dolomites serving as a dramatic backdrop. The plan is to explore the mountains and nearby towns like Bassano Del Grappa and Trento.
After three nights in Feltre, we’ll meander west along the mountains to the lake district. We’ll stay for a week in an old villa along Lake Como in the village of Torno. Along with the lakeside towns of Bellagio and Como, we’ll plan on making day trips to Milan, Mantua and Bergamo.
Here’s an example of how we used Airbnb to find our place in Torno. We wanted to stay around the lake and used the map feature. Once you zoom in on specific homes/apartments, you can view photos and research the area.
Yes, that looks pretty good! After a week around the lake, we’ll then head south toward the Ligurian coast on the Mediterranean for three days.
Cinque Terre is a string of five centuries-old villages featuring colorful houses and vineyards clinging to the rugged coastline. We’re looking forward to riding the slow train that connects each of the towns and then exploring from the sea by taking the boat service.
After our stay along the sea, we’ll head inland to the heart of Tuscany. We found a villa in the middle of vineyards roughly 30 minutes west of Siena. This will provide us a base to explore large sights like Florence, Pisa and Lucca as well as smaller Tuscan hill towns like Monteriggioni, Pistoia and Civita.
Here’s how I used Google Maps to tag interesting “spoke” sights around our five hubs locations. We’re not planning on visiting this many places but it gives me a good list from which to choose once we’re in Italy. I color-coded sights by hub. With my Google Map on the cloud, I can pull this up while on the road and we can explore. This is where pre-trip research is key.
For example, we’re planning on visiting Arezzo to the east of Siena to take in a big market held on the first weekend in October. I tagged the location and we should be able to find it with minimal trouble.
We’ll wrap up our Italian tour with a week in Venice. We found an Airbnb in a quieter, less-touristed sestiere (neighborhood). I’m looking forward to having time to just explore. Early mornings and late evenings this time of year should be much less crowded. I’m not sure you can ever soak in enough Venice.
My next post should be from Italy on Thursday if the Wifi situation cooperates. Until then, arrivederci!
……….

I hope this update finds you well.
I’ve been back from Italy for about six weeks and am still in the process of digesting all my learning from my trip. It was a fantastic experience, and I’m glad to have had my first international experience.
I will continue to update this article with photos from different days of the trip as time goes on. Nevertheless, I wanted to publish this partially completed version so as to ensure it doesn’t end up in my drafts, never to be shared with the world.
Enjoy this post,
Josh

THE TRAVEL PLANS
The plan was to visit Italy for just over three weeks, with a few days at Rome prior to joining a Tour of Italy for two weeks, with a return to Rome for an extra six or so days at the end of the tour.
We completed the Italy’s best tour with Cosmos. The tour in our trip saw us complete the following:

Places visited:
**********
TAKING A TRAVEL JOURNAL
I decided to take a travel journal to reflect both on my learning, and also to collect receipts, business cards, postcards, holy cards and other trinkets as I toured the country. All in all, I ended up with so much stuff I had to pack all the material collected separately, but there was a lot of value in journalling.
The travel journal I used was made by Typo and can be purchased here:
http://cottonon.com/US/p/typo/the-wanderer-travel-journal/2013463501982.html#start=1
Whilst I didn’t use all of the sections on this tour, I did make use of the following sections:
What follows is my notes from the notes, daily adventures, things I learnt along the way, and second notes sections. I have interspersed photos, post-travel commentary and other relevant pieces of information to make these more useful for future reference.

NOTES:
******
29/06/16
We’re leaving tomorrow morning. I’m starting to pack and get things ready now, following my usual, last minute routine.
I’m looking forward to heading off, and am glad to finally be on holidays from work.
Requests to complete for people while I’m away:
Post-travel note: I made a video for each of these requests on my iPhone and sent them to the people concerned before I returned home.

01/07/16
My first ever view of an international country (Hong Kong) from a plane.
We’ve survived our trip from Australia to Hong Kong. Shortly we will be boarding our second flight, which will take us to Rome.
I’ve followed Courtney’s advice and kept awake thus far. If I can push myself a few hours more and then sleep on the plane I should be close to achieving Rome’s time with my body clock.
I purchased a 500 ml Coke whilst here, which cost 28 Hong Kong dollars. There was a girl here who unrolled her yoga mat and proceeded to do a lot of poses… I was amazed by her flexibility. I have contacted Vanessa.
Whilst on the plane I watched:
I had chicken and rice and nearly choked on an asparagus-like vegetable. I also had pork noodles, which were nice.
Praise God for this wonderful opportunity.
******
01/07/16
I’m on the plane and we are a few hours from landing in Rome. Sleep has been nearly impossible on this plane, so I’m going to be suffering from jet lag when we arrive.
So far the food on this flight hasn’t been as good as the prior one. Nevertheless, things are more exciting now.
I watched the movie for ‘the Entourage’ on this flight, read some more of ‘The Imitation of Christ’, completed this journal entry and tried to sleep, albeit unsuccessfully.
At Rome:
We went to our accommodation and checked in our bags, as we can’t access our room until 2:00pm. From there, we checked out the Pantheon, the St. Ignatius Church (photos of the roof below), some other churches and Trevi Fountain.
We had lunch @ Vacanza Romana. First impression of Italian Pizzas is that D.O.C. in Australia is very authentic.
Also, my rosary broke but I seem to have been able to fix it.
We went for a walk again later in the day. Whilst doing this, we stumbled upon a Mass, where I went up for a blessing from the priest. Prior to that, we had Galati from a place at Trevi Fountain, which was amazing.
We also checked out some Roman ruins at the end of our hotel’s street earlier in the day.

DAILY ADVENTURES
The weather was: Sunny
Day / date: 01/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Land, check-in, get food and rest, and see some sites.
My daily adventures: See earlier notes for info on today.
We also picked up some water from a Marian fountain; I’ve consumed most of it though.
I’m also impressed with the number of drinking fountains in Rome that are free to use, and the quality of the water that comes from these. Apparently there are 1300+ in Rome, which is really impressive.
My desire to learn Latin has substantially increased.

Plans for the day: Revisit some Churches, visit the Colosseum, Colosseum night tour, and take photos, Trastavere, look for gifts.
My daily adventures: We went to the Roman Forum, which was spectacular! We stumbled upon an ancient Marian Church that is on display there until September. We got a lot of photos, so that was exceptionally well timed.
The Colosseum was fascinating, and it was incredible to tick it off the bucket list. The night tour of it was even more exceptional. Pizza from the corner shop was okay but not the best. Really cheap though. At the Colosseum, we met an Australian woman who said she thought that the Italians lived in a museum. I thought she was pretty accurate with that comment.

Day / date: 03/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia and Vatican City
Plans for the Day: Attend Mass, visit the Vatican, Check out of hotel, join and commence our two-week tour.
My daily adventures: Went to Vatican, St Peter’s Square. Bought 300 Euro odd-dollars’ worth of Rosaries, etc. which we had blessed in the Papal blessing. Moved to the new hotel. It has a bigger room but has a less comfortable bed. We met our Tour Director (Lambros in Gk. or Alex in Italian) then Mum and I went and had chips and lasagne (which was beautiful) at a local Italian restaurant that her and Courtney had eaten at year’s prior.

Day / date: 04/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Sistine Chapel, St Peter’s Basilica, Roman Forum, Colosseum, Dinner.
My daily adventures: This was our first day with the tour.
Sistine Chapel — amazing! We will definitely need to revisit this & St. Peter’s basilica to spend more time taking it in. The tour guide was great, but I felt we didn’t get as much time in the Colosseum and Forum as was necessary. I was very grateful we had visited them previously. Dinner was good, consisting of bruschetta, pasta with peas, lasagne, chicken and potatoes, then gelato and coffee.
I’m not sure how these places are able to make a profit, so I assume it is through bulk cooking that they are able to do so. Dinner was accompanied by a flute player and a guitarist, which was nice.
P.s. Today we also met our bus drive Pino.

Day / day: Tuesday 05/07/16
Destination: Roma, Pisa, Montecatini — Italia
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
On our way from Rome I felt really sick from the bus motion. Consequently I loaded up on my travel tables. As of lunchtime (now), I’m in a medically induced tiredness. We then went to Pisa and saw the leaning tower. Lunch was pizza and biscotti from some street shops. We opted to check out the Cathedral, Baptistery and the cemetery rather than climb the tower. I tried European Maccas there. We had dinner @ Montecatini at a local winery / olive oil farm. The food and wine were delicious and we had great company.

Destination: Florence, Italia
Plans for the day: visit Florence
My daily adventures:
We went to Florence today and got to do a tour with a local guide. From there we went to a local market sitting on a bridge. There is lots of jewellery and leather in Florence, but it is expensive. The highlight of the day for me was paying 15 Euro to go to the Cathedral, baptistery and Museum. We saw some relics, etc. Back at Montecatini, we went to the Funicular and then had dinner at the hotel. I then had a few drinks at the bar.

My daily adventures: Today we went to la spezia to catch a train to the cinque terre. Whilst there we visited Vernazza and Monterosso. At Vernazza I looked at the Church, went up to the tower and walked around. At Monterosso we walked around the old section, had pesto @ Ristorante ‘Da Ely” and I ought a beach towel for 10 Euro. We then caught a train to Levanto, where our bus took us to our accommodation in Genoa, a nice, four star hotel. We then went to dinner at a place recommended by our tour Director Lambros, but I didn’t think it was that great.

Day / date: 08/07/2016
Destination: Genoa, Milan, Lake Maggiore, Italia
Plans for the day: as above, with tour dinner
My daily adventures: We had a tour of Genoa with a local guide. They were very knowledgeable, but I didn’t find Genoa as impressive as some of the other locations we have visited. From there, we drove to Milan. I checked out the Cathedral, had Maccas for lunch, bought some Galati and visited the local shops. We then went to Lake Maggiore. We’re staying in a nice hotel here, although we had to get the bed adjusted from a double to a twin share. We had dinner on a nearby island as part of the tour, sitting with two Australia couples.

Day / date: 09/07/2016
Destination: Lugano, Switzerland
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: We took the bus from Lake Maggiore to Lugano, crossing the boarder into Switzerland. From there, we went to Monte Tamaro, where we had some lunch and got to see an amazing view. To do this, we had to catch a chair lift up and back. After this, we came back to the hotel.

Destination: Verona and Venice, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: we left our hotel and went to Verona, where we had a tour of the place and got to touch the boob of the statue of Juliet. We had lunch there and I had really nice pasta. From there, we drove to our hotel near Venice. At night, we went to dinner in Venice and had a quick look around. The food wasn’t too great (in my humble opinion) but Venice was beautiful.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 11/07/2016
Destination: Venice, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
We went to Venice via boat again. After finding some people in our group that got separated from the group, we did a gondola ride, which was stunning. After that, we went and got a replacement earring for Julie, before getting lunch. I had pasta and a 500ml bottle of Chianti to myself, which left me a little drunk for the afternoon. We didn’t get to see inside St. Mark’s Basilica, but we were able to see other churches, including S. Giovanni Basilica. We had some ice cream, looked at shops, went back to the hotel and had dinner with some Spanish and NZ friends.
******
The weather was: Sunny (Assisi) Cloudy (Ravenna)
Day / date: 12/07/2016
Destination: Ravenna and Assisi (Dante’s tomb is in Ravenna)
Plans for the day: Drop off Mirtza’s prayer in Assisi. Visit the Basilica.
My daily adventures: On the way to Ravenna we saw the longest river in Italy (650 km) and the church where the musical scale was invented. At Ravenna, we visited the Arian baptistery and the Church of St. Francis, along with Dante’s sepulchre. On the way to Assisi, we stopped for lunch and had a lasagne. At Assisi, we visited the Basilica, which was amazing! Three churches on top of one another! We bought some things at the gift shop and then headed over to our hotel in Perugia for the evening, where we had dinner.
“This is a beautiful country.” (My reflection in the margin at 3:15pm on bus in rural area on the way to Assisi)

The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 13/07/2016 — Wednesday
Destination: Pompeii
Plans for the day: visit Pompeii, survive the long bus ride.
My daily adventures: We left our hotel early this morning to drive to Pompeii, then Sorrento. On the way we watched a movie, ‘My life in ruins’ (a comedy allegedly w/ Tom Hanks as the producer about tours). When we got to Pompeii, I had some Pasta, bought some post cards and a booklet on the place. We then took a tour of part of Pompeii, which is so impressive! We arrived at Sorrento about 5:00pm.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 14/07/2016
Destination: Capri, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: We went on a ferry to Capri. Unfortunately, I was sick on the way over and on the bus after. This caused me to miss the chair lift. Afterwards, we went to a Museum and had lunch, followed by a walk to some scenic spots and a ride on the funicular. We headed back to the hotel for a nice buffet and went for a walk with some friends through Sorrento, stopping at a wine bar for a drink.
******
The weather was: raining
Day/date: 15/07/2016
Destination: Positano, then Rome
Plans for the day: Visit Positano, get to Rome, wash clothes for tomorrow.
My daily adventures: We caught a bus to Positano, where it was raining. This is the only day so far that it has been raining whilst we have been on tour. We checked out Santa Maria Assunta Esan Vito whilst there. From there, we made our way back to Rome, only stopping briefly at two places to get some food and to have a toilet stop, because traffic jams caused us some delays. The dinner was a bit disappointing, but the company was nice with a brief tour on the bus following at night, along with a stop over at Trevi Fountain.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 16/07/2016
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Move hotels, make our plans for the rest of the week, get a nice lunch / dinner, go site seeing.
My daily adventures: We had breakfast with our kiwi friends prior to moving to our old hotel. 140 Euro a night to sleep on a couch, as Mum had the bed. Anyway, we went and checked out the temples of portuna and Hercules, the mouth of truth and related basilica, another church and basilica, picked up some holy water, crucifix and prayer card, ate pizza and Maccas, washed clothes. I bought a guide to the pantheon (which we revisited) and read it, and also bought a bottle of cheap Chianti for consumption prior to the trip home.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 17/07/2016
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Mass @ Pantheon, visit catacombs
My daily adventures: Today we went to Mass @ the Pantheon. This was cool, as they turned on all the lights and cleared the tourists out for it. There were only 18 or so people 5 minutes beforehand, but it ended up with about 100 or so. From there, we met up with Anita & Ryan after lunch and walked to the catacombs. These were so impressive, and definitely worth the 8 Euro to get in. After this, we bought some pizza and had it on our hotel’s rooftop.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 18/07/2016
Destination:
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
We had a much needed and well-deserved sleep in and low start to the day. We then walked to Trastavere, and had a look around (although there was not much to see). Afterward, we walked to Castel Sant Angelo, and paid to walk around inside. It was quire impressive, but left me pondering why Pope Paul III had a room decorated about the pagan god Apollo. After relaxing, we went hunting for an ATM that worked and then had a nice dinner a few blocks behind the Pantheon.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 19/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Shopping for gifts for family, friends and myself
My daily adventures: We spent most of today looking around to buy bits and pieces for family and friends, then we found a really nice place for dinner.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 20/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Visit Michelangelo’s Moses
My daily adventures: I went to Santa Maria Maggiore, Santo Pietro in Vincoli, St John Lateran and the Santa Scala. We had lunch near the Colosseum, which is probably the worst lunch I’ve had during my time here. Consequently, we had sinner @ the same place as the night before. I started coming down sick today.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day/date: 21/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: Today I was unwell. Consequently, our original plans to visit St Paulo outside the walls did not occur. We’ve had a pretty laid back day today. I have purchased a backpack to take my trinkets and gifts for people home in.

Revisiting Romans 9
One of the religious topics I have most disputed in the last few years is, ‘Does God love all men?’ Historically, I have said no on the basis of Romans chapter 9.
After hearing a sermon on 1 Timothy 2:4 (God desires all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth), I knew I could not accept an understanding that requires two wills in God or the verse to be interpreted to mean, ‘all elect men’, not ‘all men’.
The only section for which I had not been able to come to a reasonable conclusion about was this section in Romans 9, particularly:
Material consulted during the process included:
I understood the Calvinist position well, but was unable to understand the Catholic position on this scripture. They are not quite Calvinistic, Lutheran or Arminian. Nevertheless, a sermon by Adrian Rogers (not Catholic) helped me along with various writings of Thomas Aquinas (summa theologica and his notes on Romans) to finally see how people with other paradigms hold their position.
This position seems to me to make better sense of the particular text, of the scriptures as a whole, and of the Catholic position. Consequently, this post constitutes a retraction of my former position (unless it can be sufficiently demonstrated otherwise that this position is wrong).
The sermon by Adrian Rogers was as follows:

We just came back from an amazing week long trip to Italy with kids. We enjoyed great weather — it was 50–60 degrees in December, great scenery and of course delicious food.
Since I am a massive travel nerd, and we have seven people traveling, I planned everything down to a minute. It took quite a bit of time to prepare for the trip, but it was definitely worth it. Huge thanks to Joanne Wilson who gave me pointers and linked me to her post about trip to Rome.
We booked Airbnb, on via Panisperna, next to Colosseum, found an AWESOME tour guide, reserved restaurants for dinner, and bought the tickets for train and museums in advance.
Arrive Rome 12:35PM, settle in apt by 3PM
Lunch: Antico Bakery, via dei Shiavari 54
Evening: Walk around Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps
Dinner: Re-cafe, Piazza Augusto imperatore, 36
We arrived at noon and boarded a van that was ordered for us by our Airbnb host. The ride was about 30 minutes and cost €80.
We settled in our apartment on via Panisperna, which was right by St. Maria Maggiore, Termini and a Colosseum. The apartment was quirky and fun. Bathroom decorations stood out.
After unpacking we needed to grab food. We headed to the famous Antico bakery for lunch. Unfortunately it was closed due to St Stephane holiday and we went to Alice pizza instead. Alice is a popular chain that makes small, thin, square pizzas of different kinds. It’s actually really good.
After lunch we headed to Trevi Fountain to enjoy, and take pictures. It was very crowded, but kids really liked it. A few blocks from Trevi fountain we found gelato San Crispino, which was on our top 10 gelato places. It was pretty amazing, especially banana, and apple flavors.
We then headed to Spanish Steps. The area was bustling and festive. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the lights. We claimed the steps all the way up and took a bunch of pictures.
After Spanish Steps we went for dinner at Re-caffe. The service was slow and inattentive, but the food was pretty good.
Morning: Colosseum and Ancient Forum
Lunch: Trieste, via Urbana 112
Afternoon: Fountains of Rome tour, Campo Di Fiori
Dinner: Cul De Sac, Piazza di Pasquino 73
We woke up early and headed to a local breakfast place. We stumbled upon La Licata — an awesome place that had variety of croissants and sandwiches including vegan, and glutton free. Coffee was great too. Right after breakfast we took 5 min walk to Colosseum, where we met with Simone our guide.
Simone came highly recommended and didn’t disappoint. For the next 3 days he gave us most insightful, and interesting historical tours we’ve ever had.
Per Simone’s suggestion we bought Colosseum tickets online, and didn’t have to wait. The tour started with Simone talking about the construction, types of stones and techniques that made up Colosseum.
As we made our way up Simone talked about gladiators, their training, lives and strategy they used to survive and thrive on the arena. Simone had encyclopedic knowledge of history, archeology, art, culture and languages and weaved together an amazing narrative.
With Simone’s help we were transported almost two thousand years back and the space came alive with vivid details.
We walked around the Colosseum, and learned about sitting arrangements, daily schedules, the economics of fighting, and even how romans made deals in the public bathrooms.
After Colosseum we headed across the street to ancient forum. Again history unfolded in great details because of Simone’s masterful story teller.
We talked about the origins of Christmas, and multiple meanings of the word messiah — both the god’s messenger and a king. We talked about Christianity and Constantine’s Arc, and how Nero killed himself and Trajan rushed back to claim the emperorship. We talked about Octavian conquering Jerusalem, and the original menorah imprinted on his arc. We talked about skillful manipulation, lies and propaganda that Roman senators, and emperors were so good at.
After the tour ended we visited Trajan’s market and column and headed to Trieste on via Urbana for lunch. Trieste is a relatively new place on a trendy via Urbana. It serves small round pizzas that are incredibly delicious. The owner was super nice, and super personable. He told us, that like true artist, he would never compromise and make pizza with ingredients he didn’t believe in. He said putting pepperoni on a pizza doesn’t make any sense. We agreed.
We sampled simple yet very delicious pizzas with mushrooms, artichokes, vegan without sauce and margarita. We also got a baked eggplant and Parmesan dish hat was very tasty. We finished lunch with Tiramisu, which was, without a doubt, the best one we’ve ever had.
After lunch we decided to go on a self guided tour of fountains of Rome. I saw the tour described on one of the websites and wrote it down. We started with Tritone fountain on Piazza Barberini. It’s a relatively small, but pretty fountain designed by Bernini.
Next we headed to Spanish steps, which were as busy as we found them yesterday, but less pretty because it was still daylight. At the foot of Spanish Steps we looked at another Bernini’s fountain called Ugly boat. We didn’t find it ugly, but we didn’t find it all that interesting either.
Next, according to the tour route, we were suppose to go to Trevi fountain, but since we visited it yesterday, we went straight to Piazza Navona instead.
The Piazza was very pretty with all the holiday lights and stands. We started with smaller fountain. It was really beautiful, and we took a bunch of pictures. We then moved on to Bernini masterpiece the Fountain of Four Rivers. We love the fountain, but even after reading about it and symbology it’s hard to tell which river is which.
We headed to Cul de Sac for dinner, a cozy place that came highly recommended by Joanne. The place didn’t disappoint. We shared a cheese platter, which was delicious. We enjoyed bean soup, spicy chicory. cheese ravioli, seafood black rice risotto and linguine with marinara sauce.
Morning: Skull and Bones Museum, Via Veneto 27
Lunch: Pasta Imperiale, Via dei Coronari 160
Afternoon: Vatican Museums and St Peter
Dinner: Sofia, Via di Capo le Case 51
We started day two with a breakfast at a place on via Urbana that wasn’t really great so I won’t mention it.
Our first stop was the Skull and Bones Museum — a strange place off Piazza Barberini. The entrance cost €8 for adults. We were very intrigued because the museum contained a crypt with art works made out of 4,000 skulls, and bones.
The place was literally amazing and unlike anything else we’ve ever seen. The photos weren’t allowed but I managed to take one anyway and after the guard made me delete it. We used the recover feature to restore it.
The crypt had 7 chapels each with a different arrangement and theme. Each featured different types of bones, and focused on different message about spirituality and death. It was creepy, beautiful and unlike anything else we’ve ever seen.
We bought a couple of magnets and bookmarks and headed to Campo Di Fiori. On the way over we stopped by Trevi fountain, which is always great to look at. Then we stumbled on St Ignazio Basilica and decided to explore it instead of going to Campo Di Fiori.
The basilica is quite large and beautiful. Tall ceiling has frescos in the style of Sistine Chapel with a very well done perspective. We explored chapels, tombs and oculus — all around very cool.
For lunch we headed to Pasta Imperiale on the gorgeous via dei Coronari.
Despite the fancy name this place proved to be a tiny hole in the wall, literally, we barely fit in. The pasta was absolutely delicious and super cheap only €5 each.
You could mix and match pasta and sauce. Gnocchi with pesto was the best. It simply melted in your mouth. Ravioli with spinach and ricotta were on point. We also had spaghetti and tagliatelle with marinara sauce. Pasta were just right and sauce was super fresh with chunks of real tomatoes. Portions weren’t big but the pasta was very filling.
Right after we headed over to Gelateria Del Teatro which was literally 20 steps away. We watched professional cannoli making through the window. Then we walked inside. Everything from gelato to cannoli was perfect.
No wonder this place was rated among top gelato places in Rome — delicious. We enjoyed a bunch of different flavors of gelato and cannoli — everything was absolutely great.
After lunch we headed to Vatican for our tour. A twenty minute walk ended with breathtaking views of casa St. Angelo and St. Peter. Kids were very impressed with the St Peter square, and we took a bunch of pictures.
Simone, our guide, was waiting for us by the entrance. Again, because he told us to buy Vatican museum tickets online we didn’t have to wait and went straight into the museum.
Simone gave us another unforgettable tour full of amazing historical details and insights. We started with Ancient Rome artifacts, and worked our way through tapestry and maps rooms to Sistine Chapel.
We continued the tour inside St Peter Cathedral and enjoyed Le Pieta and several sculptures by Bernini. Again our guide made the tour incredibly informative and engaging.
After the Vatican we took 45 min walk back to get to our dinner place, a restaurant called Sofia.
Great food, a little pricier than other places, but really good food. The place is small and very cozy. We shared mushroom and blue cheese pie, and for appetizer. For the main course we had risotto, bean soup, and cod with side of potatoes — all great. For desert we had chocolate cake and red courant cheesecake, which was amazing.
Morning: Tivoli
Afternoon: St Maria Maggiore
Dinner: La Taverna Dei Fori Imperiali, Via della Madonna dei Monti, 9
Day 4 was our first trip, a guided tour to Tivoli. We met with Simone and the driver at 8:30 near our house. Driver cost us €275 for entire tour. It made sense since there were 7 of us.
On the way over we talked about politics, economics, travel, history of Italy and many other things. Simone has truly encyclopedic knowledge, has taught in University of Rome, and has traveled the world. Every single conversation with him was awesome and exciting.
Tivoli is just a short 30 min ride from Rome. We first went to visit Hadrian’s villa. When Hadrian became an emperor he didn’t get along with the Senate, so he decided to not live on Palatine hill like other emperors, but rather decided to build a villa in Tivoli. To make sure the senators don’t disturb him and don’t try to kill him, Hadrian kept a legion of soldiers near by.
The ruins are rather well preserved and we enjoyed the tour very much. Hadrian designed the villa in a thoughtful and meticulous style. Imagine a modern house but each room amplified to be the size of a half or full football field — a study, gym, the dinning room, bathroom, etc. a study was a sacred place where emperor was meditating for days and couldn’t be disturbed.
Bath was used by the emperor and his servants, soldiers and even slaves. Dinning room was designed to be 3 different dining from rooms so that depending on the time of the day, sun angle and season you can pick the best combination — for example, cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.
Hadrian also was incredibly well traveled and recreated several of his favorite places inside the palace. For example he designed Egyptian style pool with statues running around, and actual crocodiles inside. He surrounded the pool with the dinning area, so his guests could eat in a reclined position and enjoy the view.
In the afternoon we went up to see villa d’Este, which was created by Cardinal Ippolito d’Este. Again, Simone took us on an amazing tour of history and gave us an awesome perspective on the villa. It turns out that the cardinal came from influential and powerful family that had close ties to France.
He was very close to becoming a pope, but German king vetoed his papacy. After a bitter loss the cardinal embarked on the quest to prove that he is a better men by spending over $1MM Scusi (likely close to $100mm in today’s money) over 20 years to build the villa.
It was worth it. The design of the villa is incredible. First, the villa itself featured beautiful rooms with frescos by famous painters. But the best part of the villa are the gardens with 50 fountains and 60 waterfalls, all ingeniously laid out and flawlessly executed.
We got back to Rome in early afternoon, and were in the mood for sweets. We used Foursquare to find that a highly rated Gelateria Fatamorgana was right next to our apartment. We headed there, and discovered tiny place with high quality gelato and no place to seat. Gelato was great, but we also needed coffee.
Next, we stumbled on the whole in the wall butcher shop with most amazing Italian pastry Sfogliatella. The owner of the shop only spoke numbers in English, but I discerned that he said eat it while it is hot. We ate all 3 and then went back got two more. It was just delicious.
After coffee we went up to see St Maria Maggiore, one of the biggest. Churches in Rome. We bought a quick tour to get up on the balcony to enjoy the view, and check out massive mosaic, papal rooms and a Bernini staircase.
We had dinner reservations at La Taverna Dei Fori Imperiali. But unfortunately it was closed and we went across the street to The problem is it was closed so we moved across the street to Angelino “ai fori”. The place was good, but not amazing.
8:00AM Train Rome => Florence
Snack: Antico Vinaio, via dei Neri 65
Morning: Academia, Ufizzi
Lunch: Eataly, Via dei Martelli 22
Afternoon: Duomo, Ponte Vecchio
Dinner: Mercado Centrale
9PM: Train to Rome
This morning we got up and headed to Termini to take 1.5h train to Florence. We bought tickets in advance using Italia rail web site. Ticket prices seem to vary and there are different web sites that sell them. Ours ended up being about €60 per person for the round trip.
Navigating train station is really easy, just look up your train number on a big screen to see the platform. The ride to Florence is quick and pleasant.
Our first stop in Florence was a famous sandwich shop Antico Vinaio. The sandwiches were super delicious — highly recommended.
Next we headed to Uffizi gallery. We bought Uffizi tickets online, but still had to stand in line to get the tickets, and then another line to get into the museum. The highlights are of course two paintings by Botticelli — Birth of Venus and Primavera. We also enjoyed Caravaggio and spent some time looking at pre-renaissance Italian painters.
After two hours kids were tired, and we went to lunch at La Fettuna, instead of walking to Eataly. This is a family style place where we had grilled chicken, gnocchi with tomato pasta, cheese, marinated artichokes, and thick soup made of vegetables and bread. Food was good, not amazing, but waiters were super friendly.
After lunch we went to walk through Ponte Vecchio which was super crowded, but really festive. After that we headed towards another bridge to have gelato at Santa Trinita. It was fabulous, I particularly enjoyed Strawberry sorbet.
Right next to the gelato place here was a shop with art supplies and kids wanted to check it out. They spent a bunch of time looking at different pencils, and markers and ended up buying a few.
We crossed the bridge, and headed back towards Duomo. The streets lid up with amazing lights and great atmosphere. When we got to Duomo the main church was closed, but we got into the baptistery and had a chance to admire it’s fantastic mosaic.
After baptistery kids and I headed to Campanile, and set to climb 414 steps up to the top. After 20 min wait we got in and started the climb. There was two way traffic and really hard to pass people. We kept going up and up and up and finally reached the very top.
It was very windy but the views were worth it. We took a few pictures and then started to go down. It was a little more awkward, but didn’t take long.
After the Campanile we walked around main square with a beautiful tree and then headed to the market.
The market in Florence is two floors and the second floor is entirely occupied by bistros, pizza, pasta and sandwich places. It’s one of the best markets in Europe, if not the best one, that we’ve been too.
The atmosphere was awesome. The food was just gorgeous and you didn’t know what to get. We finally settled on a pizza place, and also had a spinach rice ball, vegan soup and a bunch of cannoli.
After the market we took a short, 7 minute walk to the train and headed back to Rome. We were a bit bummed out that we didn’t get to Academia and Duomo, but overall we spent a great day in Florence.
Morning: Pantheon
Lunch: Obica: Via dei Prefetti, 26a angolo Piazza Firenze
Afternoon: Borghese Gallery
NYE: Circus Maximus
We decided to sleep in and got up around 9:30AM. After breakfast we took a walk to Pantheon. The entrance is free, and Pantheon is awesome. We read up on the history, and walked around.
Next we did a bit of souvenir hunting, and then went to Campo Di Fiori. We ran into a fresh fruit stand and couldn’t resist. The fruits were really delicious.
After the market we headed to our lunch place — Obica — a mozzarella bar. We ordered mozzarella, burrata, ricotta samplers and roasted eggplant and focaccia, several salads, soups and pastas. Everything was incredibly delicious, particularly cheeses and eggplant. This easily made our top 3 places of the trip.
After lunch we took 30 minute walk to up the hill to visit Villa Borgehese. This is one of the top museums in Rome, and we didn’t want to miss it. We bought tickets online ahead of time. You have to arrive at specific time and can only be in the museum for 2 hours.
The highlights of the museum were statues by Bernini including Apollo and Daphne, which is just breathtaking. Museum also features paintings by Caravaggio and Titan. Overall, it is a small museum, but it really packs the punch.
We went back towards our apartment, and decided to have dinner back at Trieste. As the first time pizzas were delicious. We also ordered soup of the day which was awesome. And, of course, we had to get the tiramisu again too.
After dinner we went back to apartment to rest before NYE.
At about 10pm we got back to the streets and headed to Colosseum and Circus Maximus to enjoy the New Year eve show. The streets were fairly crowded. We got to Circus Maximus about 11 pm. It was absolutely packed. It was super loud, and nearly impossible to breath because of smoke.
The show started with acrobats with drums flying over crowds. It was kind of cool and bizarre at the same time.
The crowds kept getting bigger, and it felt like at least several hundred thousand people there.
We waited until the countdown and joined the roar. 5 minutes after New Year we headed out, and walked home. Honestly the show was a little underwhelming but we had a good time anyway, and wer happy to be in Rome for 2017.
Day 7: Rome, New Years Day
We woke up late around 10:30am. Our plan was to go to Jewish Ghetto and Trastevere.
We had breakfast at Annalemma because our usual breakfast place was closed. The service was slow but yogurts with blueberries and omelette a where good. I got food next door at Ce Stamo a Pensa, which is a tiny street food place. Vegetable calzone and fried donut were absolutely delicious.
After breakfast we headed to Bocca dela Verita — a giant ancient face carved into a stone located near entrance to Santa Maria Cosmedin. We spent about 30 mins in line, waiting to stick our hands inside the mouth. The legend has it that of you tell a lie while holding your hand in the mouth, it will be bitten off.
With all our fingers and other body parts in tact we headed off towards Great Synagogue. We bought tickets to Jewish Museum, which also included a tour of synagogue. The museum was compact, but informative. The tour was kind of meh, but the synagogue was impressive.
After the museum we headed to via Portico d’Ottavia to sample local delicacies. The Bosscione bakery was closed, but we got a bunch of very tasty sweets at Cremeria Romana.
We then got fried artichokes at Yesh Sheni, and while looking for a place to eat them stumbled upon Bocca Di Dama. We bought coffee, hot chocolate, a couple of small hazelnut pastries, and one gelato. The gelato was chocolate and orange and the second scope was berries. Super delicious.
We made a two minute walk to see Fontane delle Tartarughe, a small but pretty fountain where dolphins got replaced by turtles. Right next to the fountain there was a cute pepper store.
After we headed to Trastevere, and crossed via Tiber Island — a tiny island with pretty views. We wanted to have dinner at Antico Carolone and stopped by to make a reservation. We got lucky, and got a table for 6:30 pm.
In Trastevere we first headed to St Cecile, a small church tucked in one of the smaller squares. The church had pretty courtyard.
We then went towards Santa Maria in Trastevere — the biggest church of the neighborhood. On the way we walked through more pretty streets. On the plaza before the church a street performer impressed us with her fire skills.
At 7:30 we got back to the restaurant and were immediately seated. The waiters were super warm and attentive. We ordered grilled vegetable antipasto and fried artichokes for appetizer and 3 kinds of pastas. Everything was very homey and very delicious.
In general we were surprised by home many food places where open on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day — a lot more than we would expect. Being in Rome for the holidays is no problem at all food wise, and attractions were open as well. The weather was really great 50 and sometimes close to 60. In the evenings it got, but never really cold.
Next day was our last day and we just did wanted to do the tour of our favorites — La Licata. Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pasta Imperiale, Gelateria Del Teatro, and, of course, Trieste pizza. We did manage to swing by St Peter in Vincoli which has spectacular statue of Moses by Michelangelo.
We had an amazing time in Rome in December and this was an unforgettable trip. Kids are already asking to go back ;)

This morning, I stopped by a coffee bar near my house. I’ve become friends with the barista, Stefano. As Stefano prepared my macchiato lungo, he said he had some sad news. His father, who had been ill for some time, had died. The funeral was canceled because of the restrictions imposed on the region.
Stefano placed my coffee on the counter. Normally, in an Italian coffee shop, you stand at the bar and drink the tiny cup of espresso. I took a few sips as we continued talking. A guy with his phone to his ear, apparently a co-worker, stepped over and rapped sharply on the bar. I’d violated a rule. All customers, per the decree, are to sit at tables. This is part of the mandate that people are to maintain a one-meter distance from each other. Stefano said that if a policeman drove by and saw me drinking coffee at the counter, he could be fined several thousand euros. He also reported that city officials had been driving past with bullhorns, urging everybody to stay inside.
Yesterday, at the local supermarket, a man in a uniform…directed everyone to get a large…

Italy — what a unique country! The landscapes, the food, and, more than anything else, a whole unique set of unspoken rules that no one ever bothers to explain. But don’t worry, there’s no need to panic!
In this article, I’ll give you five little secrets that I picked up from my time living in Rome. Try to embrace them, and you’ll navigate the Italian way of life without offending an entire nation. So enjoy, soak it in, and before you know it, you’ll live La Dolce Vita like a true local!
Italians don’t drink cappuccino after 11 am. They cringe at every tourist who dares to eat pizza with pineapple on top. Eating fish pasta with Parmigiano is considered a direct attack on every Italian and putting an ice cube into a wine glass is the fastest way to get arrested.
Ever heard of these things? Influencers have taken over the world and so have their over-exaggerated stereotypes of the Italians.
Italians are some of the friendliest and chill people in the world. They won’t make you slurp a carton of milk if you order a ‘Latte’ instead of a ‘Latte Macchiato’ on accident. They won’t take out some sort…

I am a Finnish software developer who recently moved to Italy. This is the third episode in a series of posts where I write about my experiences in living in my new home country.
The observations are written by someone who has lived most of his life in the Northern Europe: first around 30 years in Finland and then some years in the Netherlands.
This post is not strictly part of the same canon as the previous ones as I wasn’t yet living in Italy at the time the events took place. But the story is still worth telling because it revolves around the same topic as the previous episode: bureaucracy, oh yes!
Around August 2021 me and my girlfriend were looking for an apartment to buy in Sardinia. We went to see a couple of places and found an interesting one. In October, after a careful calculation of our financial status, we decided to make an offer for the apartment. To our surprise the offer was accepted! I started dreaming about sitting on my own patio staring into the sunset while enjoying an ice-cold Ichnusa non filtrata.
I had heard horror stories on how the bureaucracy in Italy can be extremely slow. My pessimistic expectation was that drinking Ichnusa on the patio would have to wait around early spring 2022. Magari!
I wanted to make sure that I have everything ready when the time comes to sign the papers and make the notary act. I applied for a codice fiscale in the Embassy of Italy in the Hague. I contacted my bank in Finland to apply for a mortgage, and I even had the purchase proposal translated into English for them. I made all the necessary arrangements to have all my finances available with a few clicks of a button. My bank told me that after signing the documents for the mortgage, it could take even up to a week for the funds to be available. I assured them that one week is nothing when dealing with Italian bureaucracy.
At the same time, my girlfriend was also applying for a mortgage in an Italian bank. One of the requirements for the mortgage was that there should be a technical inspection done on the apartment. Sounds reasonable. The real estate agent told us that since the building is relatively new, from the early 2000s, and the apartment is quite small, the technical inspection is just a formality, and that there shouldn’t be any issues with it.
The inspection was done around December, and we were anxiously waiting for the statement to be released. Around middle of February we received a message from the agent that all lights are green, and that everything is ready for signing the purchase agreement. I withdrew the mortgage and liquidated my other assets. I was proud of myself for being fully prepared and having everything ready. Finnish efficiency at its best — I’m not going to be the bottleneck. We agreed that we would sign the purchase agreement March 1st. I could almost taste the Ichnusa.
Things started getting delayed by a few weeks but I wasn’t worried. I guess minor delays were expected and nothing out of the ordinary. But then we heard that there is an issue that was noticed in the technical inspection. This is the first time I heard the horrifying word: sanatoria. Sanatoria in itself is not a bad thing, it’s actually good. But the problem is when the sanatoria has not been done, in other words the sanatoria is unresolved. In the context of real estate, this means that someone has improvised and built something funky without proper permissions and violated the building regulations. In Finland this means building an illegal sauna too close to the shore. Legally, you cannot sell an apartment that has an unresolved sanatoria. (Though, this being Italy, of course there’s always a way.)
The technical inspection declared that there was a mismatch between the official documents and the reality. According to the documents there should be a small balcony in the bedroom. In fact, there was no balcony but there is a window. This was a surprise both to us and the owner of the apartment. But doesn’t sound like too big of a problem, right? One might think that it would be a bigger issue if there was a balcony that shouldn’t be there. And yes, that’s true. It didn’t seem like a big problem. But while the balcony didn’t exist, whoever genius who built the apartment had decided to make the bedroom slightly larger than it was supposed to be. And that’s not good.
What is the solution? You need to find a way to make the documents and the reality aligned. So you have to either grab a hammer and start building a balcony, or you need to amend the documents. I don’t know how to build a balcony and I would expect that adjusting the paperwork is easier so that’s what we decided to do. Practically, this means that you need to have a good connection with the municipality officials and you need to hire a local geometra to come make measurements, and draw new blueprints, etc. Obviously, depending on the size of the sanatoria, all of this costs money, but time is the bigger problem. The owner would pay for the sanatoria but it can take a long time to get it resolved, even years.
Apparently, in Sardinia this is a common problem. There are many houses that have an unresolved sanatoria which effectively means that you cannot sell or buy them. Our agent came up with a marvellous (though not a unique) idea: Rather than signing the purchase agreement at this moment, we could make a private agreement with the owner stating that we pay some lump of money right now in advance, then we would wait for the sanatoria to be resolved, I could already go drink Ichnusa on the patio, and after that we would finalise the deal and sign the purchase agreement. Sounds amazing, right? Wrong. If you’ve read my previous posts, you already know that I’m not a big fan of this kind of unorthodox arrangements. We kindly rejected the idea.
The agent assured us that the sanatoria should be definitely resolved by the end of May. Time passed, our offer expired, we renewed the offer, winter turned to spring, Ichnusa got warm, and spring turned to summer. The offer expired again in June and we renewed it for one final time. It expired again in July and we decided not to renew it anymore. We hadn’t heard anything from the agent for a long time. I still had all the earmarked money lying in my bank account. I was sad and disappointed.
In July I went for a trip to Scotland with my friends. We booked a rental car and drove around while sipping whisky: Edinburgh, Inverness, Isle of Skye, Fort William, Oban, Glasgow, and back to Edinburgh. I highly recommend Scotland as a travel destination. I learned that Speyside whisky is not my favourite but I do like Highland whisky. And it was confirmed that I especially enjoy the smoky ones from Islay. Also, after having tasted a whisky it’s nice to compare your experience with maestro Lüning, Horst Lüning, and see what is his interpretation of it. I challenge you to come up with as many adjectives to describe the whisky as Horst does.
Anyway, by the end of our heavily peated trip in Scotland I received a message from my girlfriend that suddenly things are moving fast with the apartment. By some miracle the sanatoria had been resolved and that, if we are still interested, the owner is willing to sell the apartment for the same price as we initially offered. We had to act fast, because the mortgage proposal provided by the Italian bank for my girlfriend was expiring in September, and at this moment we were almost in August. August in Italy is the peak holiday season so finding a notary to notarise the purchase agreement could be extremely difficult, but luckily the agent already had one available.
Finally, grazie a Dio, in the beginning of August we bought the apartment. It only took around 10 months after we made the initial offer. The purchase happened at the same time as we were about to move from the Netherlands to Italy, which felt a bit overwhelming in the beginning. However, the combination of living in the mainland Italy, in Frascati, and having a beach house in Sardinia has turned out to be a fantastic concept. And Ichnusa does taste pretty damn good when you enjoy it on your own patio.
Random observations about the whole process:

I recently came back from a three month working culinary tour of Italy where I fell truly, madly, deeply, in love with pasta. I am a young cook from Massachusetts and embarked on the journey to awaken my senses to the culinary center of the universe that is Italy (apologies to the French). After spending about a month in Florence, eating anything and everything I could get my hands on, I decided to spend the second month volunteering on a farm in the rural city of Città di Castello, about an hour and a half east of Florence. For one month I planted seeds, milked goats, mowed grass, and for the turning point…made pasta. I had made homemade pasta a handful of times before; my dad always made it around Christmas time and I had taken a class about it earlier in the trip. But for some reason, learning it here was completely different. I was taken to another planet when I was making pasta on the farm — it was a transcendental experience for me, if you will. I fell in love with the art of it and knew that I had to continue when I arrived back to the states.
Handcrafted pasta had taken hold of me and wasn’t letting go anytime soon. Here I am, a few months later, back in the states and it’s grip is stronger than ever — I recently opened an Italian inspired handcrafted pasta business, Allora Pasta Co. I use the recipe that I learned from the woman in Italy and take the same time, care, and love as I did then. I focus on carefully sourced ingredients — working with local farmers as much as possible to ensure a delicious, quality product you can feel good about eating and sharing with your loved ones.
While I can’t share my secret pasta recipe with you, I will share a few of my favorite sauces to go along with your pasta of choice. Whip up one of these bad boys, grab yourself a bag (or 5) of Allora, a bottle of Prosecco and you’ll be transported to a little caffe set upon cobble stone streets and beautiful churches in the center of Rome. To learn more about Allora Pasta Co. and my Italian adventures, visit www.allorapasta.com.
Aglio e olio (Garlic and Oil)
Italy’s most beloved sauce and a staple of Italian cooking, aglio e olio is simple to make but offers a complex flavor that will have any guest impressed by your skills.
6 tbsp and 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves of garlic, sliced thin
1/2 cup pasta water, mmm starchy = creamy
Red pepper flakes (if you like a little kick!)
Salt and pepper to taste
Make this recipe after the pasta has already been cooked and reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water. Add the garlic and 6 tablespoons of oil to a large, hot (this is important) pan. Add red pepper flakes for that little kick. Cook over medium heat until garlic is light brown. Transfer your fully cooked pasta and the pasta water to the pan, rev up that heat, and cook — continually stirring and tossing until a creamy sauce forms and coats all of the pasta. Remove from heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, stir well to combine.
Basil Almond Pesto
Deriving from Genoa, Italy, Pesto has been around for centuries. While this isn’t the exact ‘Italian recipe’ it is an adapted version I think you will find delectable to your taste buds.
2 cups packed fresh basil leaves
2 cloves of garlic
1/4 cup slivered almonds
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Combine basil, garlic, and almond in food processor and pulse until all is coarsely chopped. Slowly add the oil and process until fully incorporated and smooth. Transfer the mixture into a large mixing bowl and stir in the cheese. Salt and pepper until perfection!
Tuscan Ragú
Ah, ‘meat sauce.’ The perfect addition to any pasta dish. Turning a light snack into a hearty, wholly satisfying meal. Add the ingredients to a crock pot and simmer for a few hours to invite an even more complex flavor over for dinner.
1 cup stock of choice (veggie, chicken, or beef)
14oz ground beef
3.5oz ground pork, such as ground sausage
2 medium white onions
3 peeled tomatoes
1 celery stick
1 carrot
2 glasses of red wine, 1 to sip and 1 for the sauce 😉
1 cup of milk
Salt and pepper to taste
Add a drizzle of oil to a medium sized pot and brown the vegetables on a medium-high flame, add 1/2 cup of the stock to keep from burning. Season with salt and pepper. Once browned, add the meat and continue to brown. Add the wine (1 cup) and let it reduce and eventually evaporate. Stir in tomatoes and milk. Add more broth if necessary to avoid sticking. Cook on low flame for an hour or so — until all the meat is cooked through and the flavors have come together. Salt and pepper to taste.
All recipes have been adapted from ones I had learned during my time in Italy.

On March 25, the Heads of State and Government from Union member nations will be gathering at the Capitol in Rome, in the very same hall in which the Union came into being.
The commemoration of this anniversary entails undertaking a reflection on the process of European integration, which is all the more pressing given that, for the first time, a country — the United Kingdom, a member since 1973 — is leaving the Union.
medium.com
A first question is what was the situation in Europe and the circumstances in the world prior to the Treaties: whether they were simpler or more complex than today’s.
To begin with, the founders were driven by strong international instability characterized by a bipolar competition across-the-board.
With the exception of the Soviet Union, Europe emerged from World War II divided and weakened.
The demarcation line between the two superpowers ran right through the heart of the continent, sundering the continent in two for a long period of time.
A few years earlier, the Berlin Blockade and the Korean War had generated a tangible threat of a third world war. In 1955, it was only with great difficulty that the Austrian question was settled by resorting to a neutrality clause. An insurrection broke out in Algeria, after Tunisia and Morocco won their independence in 1956. That same year also saw the invasion of Hungary and the Suez Canal crisis. This marked the end of an era, with Europe’s powers disabused of any residual colonialist delusion.
This precarious set of circumstances meant that Europe was in need of a new outlook.
The Treaty for the Steel and Coal Community was signed in 1951, a year after the project for a European Defence Community, which however was shelved in France.
It was Italy that became the driving force, first through the 1955 Messina Conference, and then in 1956 with the Venice Conference, with Gaetano Martino, Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Segni government, at the lead.
Backed by democratic consensus in their home nations, the fathers of Europe who brought the Treaties into being were not visionaries but men of politics who, well aware of the challenges and risks they were facing, found a way to tackle them.
Men who had the courage to transform the weaknesses, vulnerabilities and anxieties of their respective populations into strengths, pooling together each country’s capabilities in the effort of building an open, overarching society in which liberty, democracy and cohesion would be mutually guaranteed.
The Europe we have come to know in these past few years has proved to be a vital tool for stability, safeguarding peace, economic growth and progress by advancing a rights- and civilization-based social model unequalled up to now.
Europe was gradually built by the joint effort of former enemies of the Second World War and later by the former adversaries in the “Cold War” who until a few years earlier, had belonged to alliances poised to battle for forty years.
If we look back at how far we have come, it is clear that the path has never been easy ever since the beginning.
If we look at the annals, we see that the path to integration has been complicated all along, starting with France’s “empty chair” policy in the mid-1960s.
Next came what German Foreign Affairs Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher would later define as “Eurosclerosis” during the 1970s, courageously overcome at the start of the following decade above all as a result of an Italian and German initiative.
Italian Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo spearheaded this drive, working alongside figures like German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the President of the French Republic, François Mitterrand and even US President Ronald Reagan.
The oil shock, soaring inflation, and mass unemployment were the most pressing problems to be tackled at that time, against an international backdrop marked by particularly strident clashes between the two blocs.
The impetus towards European unity has always been stronger than any entrenchment or overzealous temporary distinction pursued by individual governments or groups of countries, playing a significant role in fostering the evolution of international relations.
Indeed, the common needs underpinning a shared aspiration to ensure stability to the liberty and independence of European nations were pressing, starting with the six founding nations: France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.
Today, Europe seems to have almost turned in on itself. As aware as its leadership is of the steps that need to be taken, it remains hesitant when it comes to getting them underway.
As in the past, there is a need for forward-looking visions and an ability to embark on new and courageous paths.
A few figures illustrate this.
In 2000, the Union and its Member States produced 26.5% of the world’s Gross Domestic Product. By 2015, this percentage had slipped by as much as four points.
Over the last twenty years, the population of the entire European continent — also outside the Union’s borders — has remained more or less stable at around 750/800 million people. At the same time, Africa’s population, which today is around 1 billion, could double in just twenty-five years.
These two figures alone make it clear that Europe as a whole runs the risk of becoming a minor player on the international scenario, while across the world “giant” states continue to grow.
No European nation, on its own, can guarantee the effective independence of its decisions. Considering the dimension and scale of the issues, no return to old forms of national sovereignty can assure peace, security, well-being and prosperity to European citizens because no European nation alone will ever be able to stand on the international stage, expecting to influence events.
It is as true today as it was sixty years ago: we need a united Europe to serve our Continent’s needs for development and prosperity, which are indissolubly bound up with our collective capacity to make our voices heard on the world stage, asserting the values, identities and interests of our people.
In 1957 and even before, when founding fathers Adenauer, De Gasperi, Monnet, Schuman and Spaak conceived the first blueprint for integration, European identity was neither a matter of doubt or debate. There was no need to use abstract metaphors.
The grief, hunger, rubble, disease and existential angst caused by the two world wars — East to West, North to South — brought together millions of Europeans who, ever more insistently, asked their respective ruling classes “Why?”, followed by a resounding cry of “Never again!”.
The consequences of having betrayed the values of European civilization not once but twice over the course of a few years were clear and evident to all.
The founding fathers’ call to rally grew out of the memory that a Europe of openness, solidarity, art and science; a Europe of free thinking, tolerance and integration; and a Europe of trade needed to find its way again and this was something that could only be achieved together, uniting the resources and the future of the Continent’s nations and of its peoples.
The persistence of so many separate, sovereign European states appeared to them to be, in this sense, anachronistic, no less than had been the case in sixteenth-century Italy, when the country’s free communes and small principalities before the encroachment of powers like Spain and France.
Ten years earlier, on 29 July 1947, a few months after he was elected President of the Italian Republic, in this very chamber Luigi Einaudi announced that he would be voting in favour of the Peace Treaty in a speech that I quote to you now:
“In vain did sovereign states erect high customs barriers around themselves to maintain their own economic self-sufficiency. All that these barriers were good for was impoverishing their peoples, stirring them up against one another, prompting them to talk a strange and incomprehensible language about living space and geopolitical necessities, each one of them proclaiming exclusive excommunications against foreign immigrants, as if a population ferociously shrinking in on itself can generate wealth and power rather than misery and discontent.” He went on to add his hopes for a United States of Europe: “It is not a question of preaching. What matters is that the parliaments of the tiny states of which our divided Europe is made up renounce a portion of their sovereignty in favour of a parliament in which they are represented, a chamber elected directly by the peoples of Europe in unity, without distinction between one state and another and proportionate to their number of inhabitants, with individual states represented in the Chamber of States in equal number.”
In other words, what Einaudi was has been telling us for seventy years — and this remains true to this day — is that the true alternative to fragmentation and irrelevancy for each of these States is on the contrary a process of unification based not on the hegemony of the strongest but peaceful advancement through federal and democratic institutions (as also Altiero Spinelli sought), with equal rights and duties for all States, large and small, that freely decided to become members.
Indeed, one year earlier, Winston Churchill had expressed his hope for a structure to rebuild the family of European peoples and make it possible to live in peace, security and liberty: in his words, “a kind of United States of Europe”.
Over its sixty-year history, Europe has succeeded in keeping the key founding promise of its identity.
War has been banished and, for the first time since time immemorable, three successive generations have lived without experiencing such barbarity.
It took others to point this out. In 2012, to the amazement of some, a country that is not part of the Union awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union.
When bitter armed conflict closed in on the Union’s borders in the Balkan Peninsula, despite initial hesitation and indecision, Europe realized the importance of helping its neighbouring peoples to emerge from a crisis that seemed unsolvable.
The Union chose to offer these countries a political haven within the European framework. It is therefore a source of great satisfaction to see that Slovenia and Croatia are part of the Union today and that the other nations are moving along a path of gradual integration that Italy follows attentively, favours and encourages.
Nor should we forget the fact that being part of the Union helped Northern Ireland put an end to a long and bloody trail of violence.
Over the years, the European Union has embraced peoples and countries restored to liberty after a history of dictatorship: Greece, Portugal and Spain found safe anchorage for their futures within the European Community. They were followed by veterans of Soviet influence, nations that after 1989 became part of a Europe that until then had lacked the input of its Central and Eastern peoples and cultures.
The plurality of sensibilities, political positions and national traditions within the Union today have led some to question whether it is wise to move ahead rapidly along the path to enlargement.
And yet not even Europe can afford to postpone its rendezvous with history when it calls; nor may it surrender to separation and — much less — to amputation. On the contrary, we should be practising and enhancing mutual responsibility and solidarity in sharing benefits and burdens.
European identity is constituted by the ensemble of each of our cultural and historical heritages, alongside its heritage of shared principles developed jointly over the last few decades. What we must do now is look ahead and find the right tools to ensure that integration may continue.
These years of peace, well-being and prosperity in Europe have enabled us to achieve goals of which the founding fathers would, despite limitations and shortcomings, quite rightly be proud.
The many benefits for its citizens lie in Europe’s profile.
It is the thousands of domestic customs rules and regulations that have been abolished to enable the circulation of people and goods — something that is of great value to an exporting nation like Italy.
It is the Italian products that are arranged on supermarket shelves across European cities, as more than 60% of Italy’s exports go to Union nations.
It is the one hundred million tourists that every year, without needing a passport, move freely and unhindered across the Schengen Treaty area, many of them in Italy.
It is the millions of young people who study freely in European universities thanks to the Erasmus programme.
It is the common currency which, in a short space of time, has become the world’s second most important reserve currency. As a result of European Central Bank policy, the euro has significantly brought down credit costs, safeguarding the savings of enterprises and households alike.
It is the improved environmental protection standards in our cities. It is the development of renewables and the reduction in harmful gas emissions. It is the thousands of protected areas that safeguard our quality of life.
It is the certified safety of food that protects our health, guaranteed by the traceability of the foods consumed in Europe.
It is the safety of our children’s toys.
It is the thousands of patents awarded European-wide protection.
It is the trade agreements that regulate and guarantee relations with other nations.
It is the greater security offered through the prospect of a common defence policy, recently placed back on the agenda.
It is the internal protection of our social model.
It is the Charter of Nice ensuring the fundamental rights of Union citizens.
Overturning the expression attributed to Massimo d’Azeglio, we might say: “Now that we have made Europeans, it is time to make Europe”.
Indeed it is the people, especially young people, who already live the experience of this Europe, and who are the guarantors of the irreversibility of European integration. The Union must direct its attention and efforts towards them.
The hallmarks of European civilization are our values of individual and collective freedom, tolerance towards others’ choices, and an openness to ways of thinking that come from other contexts, without abdicating compliance with local laws and traditions. Albeit with delays and shortcomings, these values have spread and asserted themselves far beyond Europe’s borders, helping to build an order in which the concepts of solidarity, mutual support among the different levels on which our societies are structured, and harmony between the public and private sectors to reduce major social scourges, are strong and distinctive characteristics of what Europe is.
Solutions to the sovereign debt crisis and the economic slowdown cannot entail a curtailment of social rights within member states. Nor are they an excuse for coarse definitions of Northern and Southern Europe.
This is the soul of our Europe. This is our identity.
If we want a stronger European Union, this is where we must start.
Every time, individually or collectively, that we have forgotten this inspirational thrust, perhaps unconsciously we have helped turn a major political undertaking into a technical and bureaucratic programme with which the citizens of Europe have sometimes found it difficult to identify.
The economic and financial downturn has shaken the social fabric of our nations, while at our gates, wide-ranging instability and epochal historical events — migration for one — have undermined Europe’s capacity to meet the expectations of its citizens.
The challenges to which the European Union must rise, above and beyond financial and migration-related issues, the Union’s Eastern and Mediterranean borders, and terrorist campaigns, once again highlight the need to rise to the challenge of reforming the Treaties. This is unavoidable, as is pointed out in the Report by the Committee of Wise Men presented recently to the President of the Chamber of Deputies.
The ambitions of the Treaty of Lisbon, today in force, appear ill-suited to the nature and breadth of these challenges, and to the pursuit of the goal of achieving ever-closer continental integration.
Building the future requires Italy and Europe to contribute every available resource, an extraordinary unity of intent and a robust faith in the founding values of the process of integration.
What we need is not a non-impossible return to a past that no longer exists nor walls that merely push the problems onto others without resolving them, but solidarity between nations, solidarity across the generations and solidarity among citizens who share the same civilization.
When a newly free and democratic Italy was taking its first steps as a Republic, De Gasperi said, “To stay the course we must draw on the reconstructive and unifying energies of all Europe. All we can do, in order to counter the march of instinctual and irrational forces, is to call on our common civilization: the solidarity of reason and a sense of liberty and justice.”
Now more than ever, we must make these words our own.
*Excerpts from President Mattarella’s speech to the Italian Parliament on March 22, 2017.

Italy, a country renowned for its rich history, breathtaking landscapes, and delectable cuisine, carries with it several nicknames that reflect its unique identity. These monikers capture the essence of the nation and the various aspects that make it special. In this article, we will explore Italy’s most popular nicknames, their meanings, and what they signify about this beautiful country.
One of Italy’s most famous nicknames is “Bel Paese,” which translates to “Beautiful Country” in English. This nickname encapsulates Italy’s extraordinary natural beauty, encompassing everything from its picturesque countryside, rolling hills, and stunning coastal regions to its historic cities filled with architectural marvels.
The name “Bel Paese” is frequently used in art and literature to describe the aesthetic beauty of Italy. It represents Italy’s legacy of art and culture, where countless artists, musicians, and writers have drawn inspiration. From the scenic landscapes of Tuscany to the grandeur of Venice, it is no surprise that Italy is celebrated for its beauty.
Italy is often colloquially referred to as the “Boot” due to its distinctive shape resembling a high-heeled boot on the map. This playful nickname is used mainly in informal contexts and reflects the country’s geographical layout.
The “Boot” concept adds an element of charm to discussing Italy and is often used to help depict the different regions of the country. For example, the “toe” of the boot refers to Calabria, while the “heel” pertains to Apulia. This geographical representation enables both Italians and visitors to understand the country’s diverse geographical and cultural landscape better.
Another popular nickname that resonates with many people is “La Dolce Vita,” which translates to “The Sweet Life.” This phrase became particularly famous after the release of Federico Fellini’s 1960 film of the same name. The essence of “La Dolce Vita” captures the Italian spirit of enjoying life’s pleasures, from delicious food and wine to beautiful art and architecture.
Italy’s rich culinary tradition, full of regional specialties, delightful desserts, and world-famous wines, epitomizes this philosophy. Italians celebrate family gatherings, socializing over meals, and savoring life’s simple pleasures — an approach to life that many associate with the Italian way of living.
While not a nickname in the traditional sense, it is essential to note that the very name “Italia” carries immense historical significance. The term “Italia” originally referred to a specific region in Southern Italy and has roots dating back to the ancient Greeks. Over the centuries, the name expanded to encompass the entire country after the unification of Italy in the 19th century.
The name is derived from the ancient Italic tribes that settled in the region. Today, “Italia” is a source of pride for Italians and an integral part of the country’s identity. It represents the nation’s long history, rich cultural heritage, and diverse regional influences.
Italy is also often referred to as “The Land of the Popes” due to its historical and religious significance. With over 1,800 years of papal history, Rome is home to the Vatican City — the smallest independent state in the world and the spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church.
This nickname highlights Italy’s important role in the history of Christianity and its influence on global religious practices. Not only does it identify Italy with a significant aspect of its culture, but it also attracts millions of tourists annually who visit the Vatican to see treasures like St. Peter’s Basilica and the Sistine Chapel.
Italy is famously known as “The Cradle of the Renaissance,” a nickname that captures its historical importance as the birthplace of one of the most significant cultural movements in European history. The Renaissance, which occurred from the 14th to the 17th century, marked a period of rejuvenation in art, science, and thought, leading to monumental changes in society.
Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome were pivotal in showcasing revolutionary ideas and artistic achievements. Renowned artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael emerged during this time, and their works continue to be celebrated worldwide. The nickname reminds us of Italy’s enduring legacy as a cultural powerhouse.
Italy is known by several nicknames, including “Bel Paese” (Beautiful Country), “The Boot,” “La Dolce Vita” (The Sweet Life), “The Land of the Popes,” and “The Cradle of the Renaissance.”
Italy is colloquially referred to as the “Boot” because of its distinctive geographical shape that resembles a high-heeled boot on the world map. This nickname is useful for identifying different regions of the country, like referring to the “toe” or “heel.”
“La Dolce Vita” translates to “The Sweet Life,” reflecting the Italian ethos of savoring life’s pleasures, including food, art, and company. It symbolizes the relaxed and joyful approach to life that many associate with Italian culture.
Italy earned this nickname due to its significant role in the Renaissance, a period of cultural rebirth that began in the 14th century. Notable cities like Florence and artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo emerged during this transformative era, leading to lasting contributions in art, philosophy, and science.
The name “Italia” has historical roots, originating from ancient Italic tribes. It has since become a source of national pride and represents the country’s cultural heritage and diversity stemming from thousands of years of history.
Italy’s nicknames encapsulate the nation’s beauty, culture, and historical significance. From “Bel Paese” to “La Dolce Vita,” these monikers highlight the unique aspects of Italian life and the enduring impact that Italy has had on art, cuisine, and religion across the world. The richness of Italy’s nicknames is a testament to its profound influence over the centuries, drawing visitors from all around the globe to experience the magic of this remarkable country.

There is none.
Ok that’s a lie — there’s some. But honestly, coming from a US upbringing it really means none. The study of “personal space” is called Proxemics, ever since 1963 when the cultural anthropologist Edward T. Hall, decided to name it extremely appropriately. Because of his wonderful work, more people have noticed this variation of how close people like to be to other people and studied it. So now we know that in North America, the average “appropriate” distance to be away from another person is literally longer than arms-length away at four feet. Italians, the culture that likes to smoosh their faces together multiple times while greeting, are absolutely fine with two to three feet of distance. I will attest to the fact that city Italians have an even smaller circle that hardly extends past their actual being. If I go into the center, I will absolutely touch other people. This is a given now, and I have accepted it for the most part. Today at the playground in the park, however, I couldn’t get over how these kids throw themselves around and over each other without a care.
The study continued to agree that “In Italy, it’s also common for people to establish extended physical contact when having an exchange. For instance, a person may reach for a friend’s forearm as a way to communicate openness and honesty or walk arm in arm with a coworker (of any gender) as they discuss something confidential.” Even when I was younger, I never minded a pat on the arm and thought it nice, so the casual physical interactions that happen here are endearing, and usually come from the older crowd. Older Italians are absolute suckers for babies and puppies and neither is safe from roaming cuddles and kisses. Maybe that’s why the kids Proxemics numbers are subzero numbers here. I’m pondering all this today as I watch three boys crawl over each other up the slide and then past Giulio as he was trying to go down it. It’s madness.
I grew up as one of maybe ten or so kids in our neighborhood that was surrounded by corn fields and woods. We didn’t have a swing set, but we had acres of land to ourselves. Of course, this mirrors throughout society and culture. In the US,I grew up with houses having backyards, grocery stores had parking lots as big as the piazzas here. Three grocery carts could pass in an aisle at the same time. I could do cartwheels in my bedroom. Here, if I did a cartwheel in any part of my house, I’d definitely be at the hospital. If I don’t have to wait for a traffic jam of carts to clear in the grocery store, it’s a good day. As described, the neighborhood fits about forty-eight (this is like a guess-the-jelly-beans-in-the-jar-number. I honestly have no idea. It’s a lot.) high-strung children from the ages of months to preteens in the size of a baseball diamond with four swings, and three slides. Of course youre going to get used to having less personal space — because there isn’t much to go around.
You know the little dance you do when someone else is in front of the item you need in the store? That awkward back and forth waiting for them to move? Not here. If someone wants something, they’ll get it. Maybe even move you out of the way a bit to do it. This, once accepted, is actually awesome when you can use it yourself.
Sometimes, it’s infuriating — this closeness. Sometimes, it’s pretty endearing. It certainly does bring everyone together — because we have to. Everyone is in everyone’s face always. So we learn to deal with each other — just like Giulio having no issue with being bowled over as he runs to the slide — with a special burst of confetti from the other kids on the way (it’s Carnevale here so paper confetti is a free-for-all and, again, everyone just accepts it). Of course, I still believe everyone needs a bit of personal space — and that that’s the best way to be. That’s why we get away every once in a while and have our garden out back. But as I live here longer, my bubble of personal space has gotten smaller, and I think maybe overall it’s a good thing. It really gets you in touch with the people around you. Ha!

Hey friend, congrats on getting married! The ceremony was absolutely beautiful. The church was so charming — though of course, not as breathtaking as the Sistine Chapel, where I went, by the way, when I studied abroad in Italy. Did I ever tell you about that?
My compliments to your caterers — the dinner was delicious. I loved your cute American lasagna buffet, but it’s just too bad you couldn’t serve authentic osso buco or cacio e pepe, which I ordered (and took pictures of for Insta) all the time when I lived among the locals in Napoli — or Naples, to non-Italians. Delicious cake, too — so adorable that it’s from a local award-winning bakery, which reminds me of this tiny rustic corner pasticceria I visited every day for tiramisu — or tiramisu, to non-Italians.
Speaking of Italy, you should have been there the first time I tried spaghetti al nero di seppia. Well, before the part where I spit it out after learning it was made from squid ink, then asked for chicky parm instead. Actually, most of the time I ate these fantastic simple buttery noodles from a part of the menu called bambinos, which in Italian likely means something like “very autentico adventuroso eaters.”

“Today we celebrate the sustained excellent results of an agreement signed 15 years ago which marked the start of an intense collaboration between Italy and the US in tracking down hundreds of illicitly exported artworks,” said Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities Alberto Bonisoli in his remarks during a ceremony at the Embassy of Italy in Washington DC for the presentation of the catalog Saving Art Preserving Heritage.
“What we are seeing here is a small part of the results of that cooperation, but no less significant in that they exemplify the shared culture that unites Italy and the US,” he added.
Remarks were followed by the Repatriation Ceremony of three artifacts and by an exhibition of 20 works of art recovered in the last two years by the Carabinieri Heritage Protection Unit in collaboration with the FBI and ICE.
The importance of the event, hosted by the Italian Ambassador to the US Armando Varricchio at the presence of Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities Alberto Bonisoli and General Fabrizio Parrulli, head of the Carabinieri Heritage Protection Unit, goes beyond the catalog that was presented and what it represents — the work done by so many to preserve Italian art and antiquities for the benefit of the Republic and the global community.
Indeed, cultural heritage itself is the foundation to our global society. We see cultural heritage — art, monuments, archives — as something greater than ourselves; a reflection of our past collective identities and a legacy we wish to see survive for future generations. This survival is especially important given the vital role of heritage in crafting memories and preserving histories.
“The pillage, looting, destruction, illicit trafficking of cultural heritage, be it Roman coins, ancient illuminated pages or precious and unique works like the mosaic floor on display tonight, is a wound in the flesh of humankind,” said Ambassador Varricchio in his welcoming remarks. “Like all wounds, it will not heal, without leaving a scar. A scar in our ability to understand past civilizations and past cultures, a dent in our capacity to shed light on the incredible human journey that defines who we are today. By losing the past, we blur our present and obfuscate our future.”
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Italy, a country with a rich past, has put the preservation of cultural heritage at the top of its agenda both domestically and internationally.
The issue is crucial also for the US, which was represented by the top cultural and enforcement officials of the Administration, including U.S. Department of State Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs Marie Royce, US Department of Homeland Security Deputy Executive Associate Director Alysa Erichs, and FBI Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division Robert Johnson.
The volume presented during the event marks over 15 years of cooperation between Italy and the US to protect and preserve Italian art, antiquities, and cultural objects, made possible by a bilateral cultural property agreement that outlined steps both countries can take to combat the trafficking in Italian cultural objects. The catalog collects more than 200 recovered artifacts.
The successes we have achieved are predicated not just on the determination of the Italian Government but also on the effective cooperation we have with our partners and friends across the globe and in particular the United States.
Artistic heritage is not just a system of “artifacts” which preserves the vestiges of styles, eras, and images of bygone human history. It is also the eternally present metaphor of a past that returns in its “distance closeness” and in the enduring oxymoron of a historical becoming that, by travelling backwards, projects itself into the present and future.
For example, a painting from the 14th or 17th century opens a window on the past, but the image we see beyond the shutter is very real to our eyes. Art comes to life when we look at it and takes us back to the very same lines that the artist drew centuries before. The same is true of archaeological artifacts.
Our century finds a market for everything, and where there’s money, there’s crime. Thus the commingling in this sector of organized crime, professional thieves, adventurers, merchants, and unscrupulous gallery managers, auction houses and museums is increasingly common. Behind the criminality of this trafficking is the real loss to humanity.
The ultimate result is the irretrievable loss of historical information.
The challenge to combat art trafficking globally, and especially in Italy, is even more pressing when juxtaposed with the Republic’s peerless cultural heritage. There are more UNESCO World Heritage Sites (54 in total) in Italy than in any other nation.
Italy and the United States have met this challenge through our agreement, which uses both legal and social measures to discourage looting and increase legal access to Italian cultural heritage.
The agreement is re-evaluated every five years in order to adapt to a constantly changing world with increasingly “expert” traffickers and shifting priorities.

“Ciao, un caffè, per favore.” That’s how every morning started during my last holiday in Italy. Typically, these mornings I spent in small cafés, filled with the buzz of loud voices and the clink of espresso cups. These cafés made you feel at home with warm sunlight streaming through the glass windows and the fine aroma of coffee delicately wrapping around you. Among tanned locals, you order a tiny espresso cup with a glass of water, just like a typical Italian. Hot, bitter coffee runs through your veins, you place the cup back on the bar counter, put on your sunglasses, and then disappear into the narrow streets…
How did I get there? After an amazing lunch with pizza, my friend and I decided to spend a couple of weeks in Italy, visiting the most iconic cities and eating authentic Italian pizza, something we had always dreamt of doing. After researching, we chose four destinations: Florence, Rome, the Cinque Terre National Park, and Genoa. We booked Airbnb flats, packed small suitcases, and embarked on our greatest adventure to the land of sun, pizza, coffee, and delicious gelato.
An unusually bright and hot sun greeted us when we arrived in Florence. Though we were exhausted from the journey, we decided to take a short walk to the city center. We were staying quite close, on the opposite bank of the Arno river. The weather was perfect for a summer evening: warm, but with a light breeze.
Our first stop was Florence’s famous cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. The construction of this magnificent Renaissance dome began at the end of the 13th century. The vast Gothic structure is striking, with its front decoration showcasing an incredible mix of pink, white, and green marble. Due to circumstances, we couldn’t go inside, so we peered into the marvelous interior through the open door.
Next, we visited the less famous but charming church, Santa Croce. I have a special connection with this place. As a child, I visited Florence with my mum. Once, in a funny and somewhat scary moment, we nearly got lost and missed our group. We had to rush across the Santa Croce Square to meet our guide. It was our first trip abroad, and we were a little scared of getting lost in a city we’d never been to before. Fourteen years later, as an adult, I stood in front of that beautiful church, smiling at my childhood memories. I was surprised at how different things looked after so many years. The square in front of the church wasn’t as huge as I remembered it being as a child.
Then we went to the Roman crossing, the Ponte Vecchio, or Old Bridge. Since the 13th century, there have been shops lining the road across the bridge. In the evening, it becomes full of street musicians and couples. Ponte Vecchio is a very romantic spot in Florence, with its great views over the river and of the bridge itself. We arrived just as the sun was setting, and its pink and brown shops started to gleam gold, reflecting in the calm water. On the other side of the river, there were tiny identical cottages with pollards. Followed by the deep red-purple sunset, we sat down on the dry, rough grass and cooled ourselves with tasty gelato. While enjoying the amazing flavors, two police officers came to warn us about insects in the grass that could bite us. They didn’t speak English well but heartily tried to convey their message. In the end, they smiled and waved to us before moving on to another group of people.
After two full days in Florence, having walked over 30 kilometers each day, my friend stayed to rest in the city while I decided to visit Siena. What seemed like a casual trip to a nearby city turned into a wonderful adventure. I didn’t expect anything special and was pleasantly surprised.
Siena is a small city in the heart of the Tuscany region. The first thing I encountered was the Medici Fortress on my way from the railway station to the city center. The massive yellow stone building caught my attention with its high fortress walls. I guessed there might be nice views from the top, and I was right. It was afternoon, and from the top, I saw a magical skyline, a clear blue sky with thin white clouds, and wide verdant hills in shades of green. Then, I entered the old city. Its narrow streets led me into a labyrinth of yellow and red stone buildings that protected me from the hot Tuscan sun. A welcome coolness covered my shoulders and made me shiver a bit. I didn’t have a map, so I followed the signs on buildings and asked people for directions. The signs led me to the stunning Piazza del Campo, with its massive Palazzo Comunale and Torre del Mangia in the center of the town. The square was full of people, cafes, noise, and street vendors. There wasn’t enough space for all the tourists. I walked a few steps up from the square and faced the magnificent Duomo, which dominates Siena’s city center. It wasn’t as big as Florence’s Duomo but still very impressive. That day, I returned to the hotel very tired. Going up and down the hills was more exhausting than usual walking.
Rome, where history intertwines with modernity, is a place of contrasts, both noisy and peaceful.
An ancient city with a vast historical heritage, Rome impresses you from the first steps. I’m not referring to the arrival by train, as the railway station, while not the ugliest or dirtiest I’ve seen, is still somewhat unpleasant. After the relative calm of Florence, Rome overwhelms you with its noise and crowds. Initially, I thought the city itself would be less crowded than the railway station, but I was mistaken. Wherever you go, Rome is packed with people in June.
The district where we found an Airbnb flat was far from the city center and didn’t seem particularly safe at first glance, with many migrants and poorly dressed individuals. However, it didn’t feel like a rough part of town, and we didn’t encounter any problems. So, we left our bags and ran to explore the city.
As I mentioned before, I visited Italy fourteen years ago, including Florence, Rome, and a few small cities. I had dreamt of returning as an adult to not only see and remember everything but to truly experience it. Italy is all about the gesticulating Italians, the smell of pizza and coffee from every corner, enjoying your dinner with pasta and wine in small cafés with lovely views, and soaking in the special atmosphere that is unique to this country.
We planned to see the most famous sights like the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and the Vatican. We marked these spots on the map and decided to walk through the beautiful old streets rather than use public transport. We also didn’t plan where to eat, leaving it to chance, which added a spontaneous and adventurous spirit to our journey.
Compared to other Italian cities, Rome feels very big and noisy. I suppose it was peak tourist season, so we were a bit unlucky in that regard. Near all the major attractions, you constantly hear street vendors calling out “Cold water — 1 euro” or “Hat, buy a hat.” You simply want to enjoy the view and take photos, but it’s almost impossible due to the crowds and the persistent sellers.
We did a quick loop around the Colosseum, hurried by a strong, sandstorm-like wind. We delved into the labyrinth of streets and found another Roman gem — the Trevi Fountain, the largest Baroque fountain in the city and the most famous in the world. Unfortunately, the situation was the same there. The small square was overcrowded with tourists, making it difficult to get close to the fountain. We decided to return early the next morning, hoping it would be less crowded.
The next day, we woke up very early and by 6 a.m., we were already at the Trevi Fountain. The atmosphere was completely different from the previous day. The fresh morning air was much more pleasant than the scorching day heat. There were only a few tourists around, allowing us to enjoy the view. This was the perfect time to walk around the city and appreciate its ancient masterpieces. We had enough time to admire the gorgeous statues and throw a coin for luck into the blue water while the statue of God Oceanus watched us attentively. Bathed in the soft light of sunrise, we moved on to the Spanish Steps.
The Spanish Steps connect the Piazza di Spagna at the base with Piazza Trinità dei Monti, dominated by the Trinità dei Monti church at the top. The marble steps, polished by thousands of feet, shone in the bright sun. Lazy, yawning tourists began to appear, and we even saw several weddings having photo sessions on the steps.
We continued our walk and arrived at the Quattro Fontane square, an ensemble of four Late Renaissance fountains installed in the 16th century at the intersection of Via delle Quattro Fontane and Via del Quirinale. The morning sun was starting to bring its summer warmth, and we chose the shady side of the road as we headed toward the Vatican.
The Vatican hardly needs an introduction. There’s plenty of information available in any guidebook, but I advise you to plan your visit carefully. Be aware of Catholic holidays and check the opening hours of St. Peter’s Basilica.
Standing in front of one of the largest churches in the world, I remembered an episode from my childhood. When I first visited with my mom, it was nearly dark. Yellow lamps cast a warm glow over the square. Our driver, who didn’t speak English well, tried to tell me something in Italian. Finally, he pointed to the Apostolic Palace and said, “Papa. Roma. Window.” It was the most memorable moment of that trip. Though I enjoyed the old buildings and their significant history, I couldn’t fully appreciate them as a child. However, that summer night, standing near the native who proudly showed me the Pope’s window, I felt something incredible. As an ordinary girl, I was standing just meters from the head of the Catholic Church and the Vatican, whom I’d only seen on television. It felt almost magical. As an adult, I felt the same childlike wonder when we returned. I showed my friend that window with a warm smile, remembering the Italian driver.
After a busy day of walking, we moved to the most beautiful and colorful area of Rome — Trastevere, which feels like a different city. After ancient forums, ruins, and historical sites, there isn’t as much to see, but the atmosphere is entirely different.
The busy city blurs in the dim sunlight as we step into the Trastevere area. Its narrow cobblestone streets are picturesque, lined with ochre-colored buildings entwined with bushy green plants, arched passageways, and old doorways with antique door knockers. Don’t miss this atmospheric place. My friend from Rome recommended a café known for its famous pasta — tonnarelli. Although there was a long queue for a table, it was worth the wait. The outdoor tables, warm yellow lights, loud emotional Italians, and delicious food created a recipe for small happiness.
We finished our pasta late in the evening and took a walk around the city. It had completely transformed. The day’s heat had given way to a fresh breeze. Tourists had disappeared from the streets. Bright day colors had faded, replaced by ochre and dark brown hues under the cozy yellow street lamps. Magic was in the air, filling us with complete happiness.
The next day, we left Rome. It will always hold a special place in my heart. Rome is where treasures can be found around every corner, and even the most unassuming streets hold incredible history. You just need to ease your mind and enjoy the city, where history intertwines with reality in a quaint way.

After the problems with my passport finally subsided (not so funny story: it was expired and I had to leave the country to renew it, but couldn’t leave the country with an expired passport), my family decided it was time to venture out further than our usual trips from northern to southern California and organize our first visit to Europe. The planning process was strenuous as each of us tried to melt our ideas of the perfect adventure together, but looking back I could not be happier with how it played out. One of the most memorable experiences, in fact, was our two-day deviation from the mainstream: Quercianella.
Rather than hitting every crowded tourist destination in Italy, we rented a car in Florence and drove down the Tuscany coast, stopping first at Sienna, and then ending at a miniature beach town by the name of Quercianella.
A town where you could count the number of restaurants on your hands, and every resident was likely on a first-name basis, this was the epitome of an escape. The air smelled of salt and the temperature was perfectly warm. Every one there seemed care-free — families walked freely on the sides of the road, shop owners sipped coffee outside, and you could see locals laying on the stretches of rock and beach basking in the sun and purely enjoying the company of friends or a good book.
After driving down the town’s narrow roads for a while, we found our “Villa Margherita” and unpacked starved, ready to uncover the local wonders. Being a Yelp-connoisseur, I offered to scour the food scene, but soon realized that Yelp did not carry much weight in this little town. So, we slipped on our sandals and just began to walk. After following the main road for a few minutes, we turned onto a street with a gelateria on the corner, and quickly found a pizzeria nearby.
We sat outside on a string-lit patio and soon began speaking with the waiter, who also happened to be the owner’s son. In contrast to the people working the service desk at the hotel, with whom we had to communicate through vague hand gestures, he spoke a great amount of English. It was a comforting revelation, since the town probably did not get many tourists coming from the US. So, taking advantage, my dad asked for dish recommendations. He told us to get a pizza each, as they were personal-sized and he could easily finish one or two. We probably should have known that his idea of personal would differ than ours, however, and when he brought them to the table, all my sister said was “it’s almost bigger than me!” I wasn’t complaining though; we ended up taking the leftovers for a late-night snack.
At the end of our delicious meal, we were greeted by another unexpected surprise. We began talking to the owner and his son about where we were from (Palo Alto, California), and the son’s face suddenly lit up. It turned out he had lived a couple miles away from us for ten years while working his past job, after which he decided to take some time to move back home and work with his father. Our meal then turned into a night of laughs and good conversation as we exchanged stories of California and got to know the family of the pizzeria.
Even in a seemingly random beach town, we found a connection to our home thousands of miles away. The unexpected link was a reminder that we live in a minuscule world where the owner of a pizza place you happen to stumble on in Tuscany could very well have once been your neighbor.

“You packed what for Rome in March?”
That was the customs officer, eyeing my linen jumpsuit and flip-flops as if I’d just stepped off a cruise ship in the Arctic. To be fair, I thought March in Italy meant early spring. Blossom-scented breezes. Aperol spritzes under the sun. The Colosseum is adorned with charming gowns.
Instead, I stepped into what felt like a chilly Roman version of Seattle. The wind whipped through my bones. Locals wrapped themselves in puffer jackets and scarves. And there I was, dragging my tiny carry-on and an overinflated ego through cobblestone streets in socks that were basically social distancing from warmth.
Let me save you the frostbite. Here’s what I wish someone had told me before that first trip.
Italy in March sounds like a dream: off-season travel, fewer crowds, blooming landscapes, cheaper everything. And yes, that part is true.
But what your dreamy Pinterest boards don’t tell you? March in Italy is moody. One moment you find yourself soaking up the golden sunlight on the Spanish Steps, and the next, you find yourself sprinting through an unexpected downpour. The weather changes its mind more often…

Seated backward on a high-speed TGV approaching the 8.5-mile-long Mont Cenis tunnel, I unwrapped a piece of Tome des Bauges I had purchased hours earlier at Chambéry’s Marché Des Halles.
Next to it on my tray table, I had a tiny baguette, given to me free at La Panière, just outside the Marché. Thankfully, the bistro on board offered wooden cutlery so that I could cut the rind.
I was even more grateful that the bistro sold a crisp Pays d’Oc chardonnay to accompany my 11 am snack.
This grassy, somewhat stinky cheese would be my last taste of the French Alps on this trip.
I would soon enter a tunnel that would take me under 6,000 feet of rock — pushed upward by tectonic collisions 30 million years ago — and when I emerged, I would be in Italy
Pepin the Short crossed here in the 8th century, at the request of a besieged Pope Stephen II. Two decades…

GOSPEL songs — earworms! — play in my head constantly now after two intense weeks of learning them with a choir touring Tuscany. We weren’t a choir before we boarded our respective flights, but we are a choir now.
And right now I can ‘hear’ a very beautiful Italian prayer-song, Signore Delle Cime — Lord of the [mountain] Peaks — in my mind and I, a non-believer, am nevertheless deeply moved. Who wouldn’t be?
Signore Delle Cime asks the Lord to take ‘our friend’, a fallen mountaineer, up to heaven covered ‘with a soft white blanket’. It soars.
Then there was Bella Ciao, the rousing hymn of the partisans who would die for la liberta. It seems all Italians know that one.
The 30 singers in our choir are mostly Australian and we also have a sassy soprano from Canada who lives in New Zealand, three terrific tenors (Scotland, Canada and New Zealand), and an Irish lass, our scintillating soloist and queen of the altos, who lives in Melbourne.
We learned songs, mostly gospel in nature, in Italian, French, Samoan, Zulu (yes!) and English. And we performed a selection of them in two churches, one in the gentle medieval town of Mercatello sul Metauro in the Marche region that borders Tuscany, and another in Firenze. (The angelic altos are pictured above.)
Our maestros were exceptional talents — Guerrino Parri in Mercatello, Edoardo Materassi who taught us in the first week of our tour in Montestigliano, near Siena, and in Firenze, and Tony Backhouse, who taught us for the entire two weeks. Many readers will know Tony from his acclaimed Sydney-based choir, the Café at the Gates of Salvation Gospel Choir, as well as his Heavenly Light Quartet. That’s him, below, with Guerrino in the background getting ready to begin.
Each of these three conductors was a joy to watch at work. So knowledgeable — so animated! — and able to sing each part (bass, tenor, soprano, alto), they lifted us up with their energetic love of the music and of teaching it. What a joy.
Members of Guerrino’s choir in Mercatello joined us for our concert there, and in Firenze we were treated to exceptional performances by Edoardo’s choir, Animae Voces, who also joined us for some tunes.
Now I am in Anghiari, ‘my’ beloved medieval village near Arezzo, very happy to be here again so unexpectedly soon, thanks to one person dropping out of the singing tour before it began. [I spent last November and December here.] ‘Making Music in Italy’, organised by a Byron Bay-based outfit, The Create Escape, had been fully booked when I inquired about it months before. When I tossed my cap in, I assumed it unlikely that a spot would become available — but it did! So, with just four weeks to get myself prepared — flights, insurance, what to do after the tour, and so on — I said yes. Life is short, yes?
I have always eschewed the idea of group tours, but now I am very glad I took what felt like a leap of faith and dived in. The accommodation in Montestigliano, Mercatello and then Firenze was excellent and interesting in different ways; we ate sumptuous meals, had some lovely parties and stimulating side trips as well as the pleasure of learning. (You can see a snippet of one of those parties here.)
One of the side trips was to the hilltop restaurant Il Girone dei Golosi just out of Mercatello; another was to the beautiful organic winery Pomaio near the town of Arezzo where we went for lunch on the way to Firenze (see pics below).
I’m sure we all made some lovely new friends. (And here I must make special mention of Susie and David from the Northern Rivers who had the brilliant idea of making this tour the first leg of their honeymoon! It was a treat for all of us to have them along.)
Now I’ve seen more of Tuscany than I had before. It is my fifth time visiting Anghiari and I’ve opted to spend a month here to catch up with acquaintances I have come to know and love. After all, the airfare is just the same for six weeks as for two, isn’t it?
A presto. Mimi :)
PS: If you would like to see the choir in action, some parts of our concerts can be found on YouTube. Go to ‘Making Music in Italy, 2024’. You’re welcome. xx

It was June 2023 when I drove to Italy for 3 weeks to find a second house or a renovation project in Italy. I had sold my house in the Netherlands as I felt it was time to move forward without any mortgage. Freedom.
Initially I was focussed on moving to Spain. My boyfriend’s native language is Spanish, and learning Spanish is already a challenge. Putting another language in the mix like Italian, didn’t feel very useful. Long story short, I couldn’t get a homy feeling in Spain, and I always loved and felt connected with Italy. Italy it was.
Like many house searchers, Idealista is a great way to start. With a long list of 50+ houses I drove to my preferred area around Lucca and further up the coast in Liguria. Obviously many houses weren’t at all what they seemed online, but more, I couldn’t see myself living in those areas. Secondly, I was all over the place with what I was looking for: a nice holiday home or a golden gem like a big mansion to renovate.
Having one week left, I went back to the heart of Piemonte where I had spent the first 2 nights. I ended up in a B&B owned and run by Francesca. We clicked and I loved the area: the rolling soft hills with its vineyards, the laid back little villages with one bar in the center as the communal place to meet each other for coffee or an aperitivo.
I visited some more houses in the area but nothing came even close to making my heart jump a tiny bit with excitement. This is not the right way, I felt. Let’s reverse the process: stop hunting, trust that life will show me what or where to look next. As a side note, I always bought the houses I lived in very intuitively, which has never let me down. In fact, it has given me a lot of financial expansion over the years.
I just posted my ‘I trust the universe’ post on facebook when the cousin of Francesca stepped into the garden. 10 minutes later, he offered to show me his house down the road that he bought a year ago. Would I be interested to buy his house as his plans had changed?
Is this a sign? Curious as I am, I said that I would be open to explore. It wasn’t love at first sight. It wasn’t the Liberty House from early 20th century with heigh painted ceilings I was hoping to find, but it was huge! And that ignited my interior design excitement. I love a good renovation challenge! I have had my design business for 13 years, and although I never see myself in that role again, I love to be my own client!
3 Months later I signed the contract, and became resident in one day. The house, with a potential of 600m2 living space and 14000 m2 land, was mine. Definitely a design challenge as 40% of the house, the barn with its hay attic, needs a complete transformation. For Italian standards the whole process went very smoothly, mainly due to great help I received from the seller!
Why did I say yes? It just felt like the one thing to do. Not just buying it, but to move out of the Netherlands immediately and start something new. It all felt right: the potential of the house with 7–8 bedrooms and the potential for an equal number of bathrooms, living spaces to share and some to keep private, enough space for my children to come and stay, alone or with their friends and the idea of creating a business sanctuary, whatever that will be…I felt a new phase opened up. How exciting!
Back to the summer of 2023. My partner wasn’t as thrilled as I was when I showed him the house the first time. Understandable! His favourite spot to visit, the Netherlands, was suddenly swapped for a rural area with a bunch of farmers. Having a long distance relationship for 6 years now, travelling between Lima-Peru and The Netherlands very frequently, has worked well for us, but will it be the same with my drastic move?
While I didn’t really involve my partner in the decision, I did involve my 3 (young adult) children! Perhaps not realising the complete impact of this move, they were supportive of my choice. I feel blessed with their ability to give me this space although it certainly hasn’t always been easy for them for different reasons.
So here I am, 14 months later. A year of learning and rooting. Slowly learning the language. Connecting with the ground I live on. Making the house with simple means a home for now until the renovation is done. Enjoying the simplicity of life in the country. Meeting so many beautiful new people, of which a few are becoming good friends.
And of course, not everything goes easy and smoothly. My renovation started with a classic mistake, trusting the wrong person and ignoring my inner doubt as I was too eager to get started. It has cost me quite a sum of money with which I had come to terms with for myself. I felt so angry and frustrated but also a bit ashamed with my mistake. Shouldn’t I know better as an experienced renovator and intuitive person?
I stopped working with the first contractor, continued with his collaborating partner (as he was a victim of the whole situation as well) to finish the terraces and new swimming pool. Normally one starts with the house and the outer areas are last on the list. For sure it will turn out quite unpractical to have a new terrace while the whole house needs to be taken care of, but I am so happy I enjoyed a first summer with a lovely space outside and my beautiful new swimming pool. At least the pool can’t fall of the budget anymore! A lovely first summer, sharing it all with friends, family, and of course my children.
While I moved on my own to a country where I didn’t know anyone, I can’t say I ever felt alone or lonely. In fact, in between all the visits, and my own travelling to the Netherlands, Peru and some other places, I am happy to have some weeks on my own. I love the different seasons: fresh sunny spring, warm rain free summer, foggy autumn mornings and cold winters with the snowy mountains of the Alps as a postcard view from my terrace.
And the house? For a while I didn’t want to renovate it at all. I live so comfortably already, and I have enough rooms for guests to stay. My youngest spontaneously brought 7 friends for a week around New Years Eve. My son enjoyed a week in the summer with 6 of his friends! And you know, sharing 2 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms worked fine for everyone.
But after a few months, I felt the excitement bubbling up for the next phase of the renovation. I refreshed my skills so I could use my design software again. It had been a while but I really loved solving this big puzzle. How to make the best out of the house. This part had always been my favourite element of my interior business: creating the most optimal living spaces, a natural flow, all within the limits of the building and a budget. To me it is the definition of simplicity: creating such a design that solves all complexity (integrate all wishes affordably, elegantly, beautifully and within the limited space) while the results looks very natural like the house has always meant to be like that. In other words, I don’t like over designed houses for the sake of creating something new and expensive.
The house had grown on me, which made me change some of my initial ideas. I finalised the complete design in September. Now what? How to find the right contractor(s) this time? One that is flexible to find affordable and beautiful solutions: my budget is limited and my standard is high! But more importantly, finding one who is willing to work differently from the very bureaucratic way that is known in Italy and very costly in my view.
I did hire a geometra. A geometra works within the triangle of the municipality, the contractor and the house owner. A geometra can easily take 15–20% of the budget as an add on! That is excluding the costs for an architect, an interior designer and an engineer (for constructive calculations). I decided to hire my geometra only for the permit, the (ridiculous but mandatory) safety and security rules and some engineering guidance. I followed the same process as I did in the Netherlands for many years to receive budget proposals from 4 contractors. Well, that already made a pre-selection. Two of them resigned as they didn’t like my way. They would only give a quote based on the standard procedure here where the geometra prepares the whole costing format. Basically this means, they only have to fill in the price per item and you get a very clear overview per contractor what his offering is. Sounds great and good for comparing budgets, but quite costly for me and way less flexible.
Now I am left with 2 parties who both feel like good companies to work with. One of them is very eager to grow his business and the other has an established contracting business. I haven’t finalised the deals yet, but it feels like the project will be divided amongst these 2 parties.
I am excited to get started, to work with the workers wherever I can, find solutions and the right materials. I am best when I can design the little details in the moment.
Please follow along in this blog to read about my weekly updates, surprises, joys, fun facts and challenges as I navigate this BIG project!

We had promised our son that we would take him to Italy, especially since we named him after our memorable trip to the country over a decade ago. In 2024, we finally embarked on an 8-day journey to Italy, keeping our commitment to our beloved son and eager to share our past experiences with our kids.
(You can also read this article on my travel blog — GracefulTrips.com)
Upon arriving in Rome, we took the train to Florence, using it as our base for exploring nearby cities such as Siena, San Gimignano, and Pisa. We also took some time to explore Florence, known as the capital of artists. Afterward, we took the train back to Rome and visited all the famous historical sites before flying back home.
This article will list the cities we visited, not necessarily in chronological order.
We signed up for a walking tour, the best way to learn about this area. The guide showed us what all the buildings used to be and the stories behind them.
We could see the prints by the chariots and the original bricks on the streets (the ones marked with the letter V).

Been working in italy since 2014. Tipping was frowned upon. Then cover charges started popping up. Just got back after 3 weeks in Rome, Florence, and Rimini and EVERY restaurant had cover charges. At one restaurant the GS (servizo incluso) on checks plus the coperto (cover charge) equaled 50% of what I paid. I spent more between them than I do paying 20% in the US. I didn’t get back to France and Spain this year and wonder if they are doing the same?

A few days before Christmas, Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli was welcomed back to Earth after a long tour on the International Space Station.
During his four-and-a-half months he posted some of the most amazing photos and images of Italy from space… And he became the first astronaut in space to make pizza aboard the International Space Station.
With the end of his latest tour on the International Space Station, Nespoli has spent so far a total of 313 days, 2 hours, and 36 minutes in space.
We can’t thank him enough for his photos and the amazing posts on social media.
To celebrate the upcoming new year, Italy, and the beauty of our country, and to thank Nespoli and all Italian astronauts, we decided to publish a mini collection of some of the most beautiful images of Italy from space, as logged by Nespoli and other astronauts in 2017.

Out my window in New York I can see a tall white slice of a building where the Russian diplomatic corps lives. In that contained compound, there’s also a long, low building with a big round window, a school for their children. What are the mindsets of people there — especially when they see protesters waving the Ukraine flag across the street? What kind of history lessons do they teach those kids?
I mention this curious, closed-off world because it’s the kind of environment that can send fiction writers down long trails of exploration. And if all their research and imaginings lead to a vivid, unusual tale, readers may scratch their heads and wonder how the heck the writer came up with it.
When I read a new novel by Paolo Bacigalupi, Navola, I did some of that proverbial head scratching. It’s set in an alternative version of Renaissance Italy, filled with deception, vast wealth, and cut-throat power plays. So many questions surfaced in my mind, which led to some unexpected discoveries.
Before getting into that, here’s a little bit about Bacigalupi and the novel. If you’re a sci-fi fan, you might have gone head-over-heels for his first published novel, The Windup Girl, which picked up two of the most prized awards in the genre, a Hugo and a Nebula, along with other honors. Maybe you read some of his work that came after that — until he disappeared from the literary scene. Then last year, he rose up once again with Navola.
This marks the first time that Bacigalupi has dived into the fantasy genre. He sidestepped many of the usual suspects — magic spells, knights, princesses, witches, elves. But he did dust off the old dragon trope and gave it a strange quality. We first learn about it in the book’s opening paragraph, which begins:
“My father kept a dragon eye upon his desk. An orb larger than a man’s skull, gone milky and crystalline but still burning with inner fire as if it retained life.”
MISFIT IN A POWERFUL FAMILY
The narrator is a boy, and later a young man, born into a banking family. The young scion, Davico, may be extraordinarily wealthy, but he can’t meet the huge expectations of the father he so reveres. Davico is educated in warfare and how to perceive the dark secrets that are rife in Navola, the city-state where he lives. He pushes himself to become a master negotiator and to achieve far-reaching knowledge about all the bank’s clients. But he seems to always fall short. His passions and natural gifts lie elsewhere.
One of his gifts has to do with that dragon’s eye. The relic isn’t mentioned very frequently and seems inert to everyone but Davico, who senses its pent-up power. It seems like it’s going to do something. But what? I read much later into the night than I should have, wondering about that.
Another reason for my sleep deprivation had to do with a character named Celia. She arrives just after Davico’s father wreaks revenge against her family, which had plotted to overthrow his power. The father decides to adopt Celia, giving Davico an unexpected sister. It makes for an awkward introduction.
Over the course of the novel, Celia transforms from a subdued, quiet girl into a vivacious wit who is able to navigate through the treacherous, opulent world much more easily than Davico.
A third reason why I couldn’t stop reading relates to Bacigalupi’s master skills of foreshadowing, teasing the reader about what’s to come without giving much away. Consider the confessional tone of Davico in this passage, which is addressed to his readers:
“I have lost interest in hiding who I was or what I have become. I am tired of the lies and excuses, and wish only to lay myself bare before you, so that you at least will understand, even if you do not forgive.”
In addition to all my curiosity about where the book was headed, I also started to wonder about Bacigalupi’s inspirations and how the book had come about. It was so different than what I’d read of his other work.
It wasn’t hard to discern that novel’s world was some ancient version of Italy. Bacigalupi also invented certain words, gestures and body markings that seemed to borrow from Italian culture. But where was that all coming from? With a name like Paolo Bacigalupi, I assumed that he had an Italian family history. I was wrong.
My research uncovered an unexpected set of circumstances. Navola’s storyline came to him at a time when he was no longer interested in exploring the sci-fi topics he’d become known for, like changes in the world due to extreme weather and bioengineering.
‘NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,’ NEW AVENUE
He explained his mindset in a Write-Minded podcast interview: “A lot of the [future] trends that my brain locks onto are the frightening ones. And so you end up spending time being sort of anxious in your daily life. And then you go into this creative space where you actually expand on those anxieties and go deeper and deeper into them. And it builds this sort of, I don’t know, synergistic toxicity. And eventually I just broke down, fundamentally. I kind of had a nervous breakdown.”
A new way forward gained momentum during a trip to Italy with a friend, who wanted to learn Italian by living in Bologna. Bacigalupi had gone along for the ride. But it turned into so much more than that. Italian architecture and history proved fertile ground for his imagination, and that’s so evident in Navola’s landscape.
“One of the things about Bologna was all these rival families in the city would build these towers, and they were defensive towers for their families, but they were also statements of wealth and importance,” he told Locus magazine in a December 2024 article.
“The landscape is telling you something about politics, saying, ‘Oh, this city is not a cohesive political unit, even though you’ve got a wall that goes around the whole city — inside it, there are armed factions who war with each other, and retreat into their towers when they’re unsafe, then come out and attack each other. They’d imprison one another in their towers, all sorts of stuff. You can see this layer of anarchy clearly established in the architecture, and that’s not something that I would have organically thought of, but it’s something that I could observe and then steal and bring into my own world.”
There was at least one unexplored story thread in Navola that I kept waiting to play out as the pages turned. And while it never did, I suspect it was a little hint about what’s to come. At the time he was interviewed by Locus, Bacigalupi had written 60,000 to 80,000 words of a sequel book. As with Navola, it will be published by Knopf.
“I’m going to let the story be as long as it wants to be. If I need to go back to Knopf and offer another book, I’ll do that. If I can wrap it up elegantly in two, I’ll do that,” he said at that time. “I’m trying to be as loose as I can with it and allow the thing to take on the shape that it wants.”
With or without that dragon’s eye, I’ll be waiting.

That’s what a friend told me before I went to my next travel destination, and she was right. It was summer in England, but it did not feel like it (knowing English weather ☺), so a quick summer getaway to Lake Como seemed like a good idea. And mind you, Italy never disappoints.
For my first photo blog, I would like to share my experience of my recent trip to Lake Como. Lake Como, or Lago di Como in Italian, is located in the Lombardy region in the northern part of Italy. It is surrounded by different towns, and visually, it looks like an inverted Y when you look at it on the map. Popular for its beautiful waters, majestic grand villas and gorgeous Italian towns, it has always been a favourite summer destination for locals and tourists around the world.
There are several towns surrounding the lake, and the most popular ones are Varenna, Bellagio, Menaggio and Como. For this trip I decided to stay in Varenna for its strategic location and more peaceful scenery compared to other major towns. I stayed in Lake Como for 4 days. I know it might not be long enough because there are still lots to see and explore.
How I got there:
I travelled from London Heathrow to Milan Malpensa airport since the nearest and most convenient airport to reach Lake Como. After landing in Milan, it took fifty minutes to an hour via train from Milan Centrale to reach Varenna. You can buy your train tickets from the airport or by using the Trenitalia app on your mobile phone. My advice is to book your tickets via the app in advance because train tickets might be difficult to book, especially during peak seasons. Trains usually depart every hour, and a one-way ticket costs me 11 euros for a first-class seat. To be honest, I’m not sure if it was too hot in Italy at that time, that the temperature in the train was too warm as well. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant journey overall.
Where I stayed:
I decided to stay in the town of Varenna in the eastern part of the Lake. My stay in the town was pleasant and calm, probably because of the smaller crowd since there were fewer restaurants and establishments in the area. There were different accommodations to choose from, ranging from high-cost hotels to cheaper, but still comfy ones. Just a quick warning, though, there were several areas in Italy where air conditioning in hotel buildings was regulated at specific times of the year. Be sure to do your research before choosing your accommodation. My hotel was a 5-minute walk from Varenna Train Station, which was also a big plus for me.
What I did:
There were several exciting activities that you can do in Lake Como. It ranges from walking tours, visiting Italian architectures on each town, visiting beautiful villas via boat tours, dipping into the lake and many more.
First Stop
After checking in the hotel, I went straight to a pre-booked tour of two of the most beautiful Villas in Varenna, Villa Monastero and Hotel Villa Cipressi. Roaming around Villa Monastero, you can see the attractive garden and the majestic view of Lake Como. The view of the lake was so stunning, and I’m sure you will be amazed too. It’s one reason why many movies were filmed here, like Oceans Twelve, Casino Royale and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.
I went straight to Hotel Villa Cipressi and enjoyed the view of the garden and the lake while sipping Aperol Spritz and eating Italian panini! Truly Dolce Vita! The Villa is part of a hotel that has a restaurant and bar open to both guests and non-guests. There were so many Instagrammable spots in both villas, and I recommend that you visit them.
After visiting the villas, I explored Varenna on foot to see what this town has to offer. I went to the town centre and there were couple of restaurants along the lake shore. The place was a bit crowded since it was summertime but still manage to roam around and find amazing spots, fancy restaurants and local stores.
The lake view was so serene especially during golden hours. It was so pristine and calming for the senses and worth capturing on your camera lenses.
As I walked back to my hotel, I saw group of people enjoying the sun and having a dip in the lake. I should have brought my swimming trunks and sunscreen with me ha-ha.
I ended up the day having authentic Italian pizza and a glass, uhm okay glasses of red wine ha-ha.
There will be more stories to come in the second part of my Lake Como journey. Hope you enjoyed this short blog and can’t wait to share the rest in the next part! Thanks for reading!

Or how a Balinese priest told me who I would marry
“There’s a wonderful old Italian joke about a poor man who goes to church every day and prays before the statue of a great saint, begging, ‘Dear saint — please, please, please… give me the grace to win the lottery.’ This lament goes on for months. Finally the exasperated statue comes to life, looks down at the begging man and says in weary disgust, ‘My son — please, please, please… buy a ticket.”
That profound realisation is from the blockbuster book Eat Pray Love. In the iconic movie scene, Julia Roberts says these words while overlooking ancient Rome. I have seen this film time and again, but I didn’t realise it until last year — did I just relive Eat Pray Love itself?
Dear saint, I did buy three tickets years apart… to Italy, India and Bali… and my lottery is a prophecy.
Italia… amore a prima vista! I was a teenager on my birthday when I first set foot in Italy. The fact that I don’t recollect the exact year is evidence that I speak of time long passed. It was a high school trip and my highlight was Casa di Giulietta (or Juliet’s house) in Verona. I revive the memory of a line of people flocking to this medieval tiny courtyard with one wish in mind — to find true love. Standing before the statue of Juliet, supposedly where Romeo wooed her, I was observing how everybody was writing their names on a wall, followed by symbols and dates important for them, as well as the name of their crush, husband or partner.
And then there was me. I found myself in front of the wall with a pen in my hand. I wrote ‘’Mila’’ followed by a tiny doodle of a heart. And then I looked up to the sky and set out the following intention ‘’I left the space next to my name empty. Let whoever is meant to be with me, write their name next to mine. And let the universe do its magic and introduce me to that person in divine timing.’’ Something inside of me as a young girl told me that I was probably the only one who did that.
But the woman in me today knows who wrote their name next to mine.
Namaste, India! It was my 21st birthday. The land of contrast. The thing about India is that you either love it or you never want to go back. I fall in the first category. I call to mind entering a Hindu temple for the first time in my life. ‘’No phones allowed’’ — it said on a very high fence. As a 21-year-old just entering the era of Instagram this is the last thing you want to hear. ‘’Well, I don’t have a choice’’ — I said to myself while proceeding to entering the temple. If you have been to India, you know that New Delhi is chaotic. Yet, somehow this Hindu temple was the trailer to how tranquillity feels like in the hustle and bustle of the big city.
The only time before that I was in awe of a building was in Barcelona when I entered La Sagrada Família. But Akshardham Temple in Delhi was something magical. This was the exact moment when I fell in love with India, Hinduism and Asia. I stood in front of the central sanctum and in a trice I couldn’t see anyone else. It was just me and this massive gold statue before me. The entire world went still. It was a fleeting moment, but it was something that I couldn’t explain to myself. What I know for sure, though, is that if I had my phone with me I wouldn’t have had this memory.
Om Swastiastu, Bali! I had to go back to Asia. The older you grow, the more life pushes you to search for peace, meaning and answers. ‘’Om Swastiastu, Miss Mila, my name is Ketut, nice to meet you.’’ No way. Did he say Ketut? I just rewatched the movie Eat Pray Love (which is by the way based on a true story) on my flight to Bali and if you have seen it, you know who Ketut is in the story. To make the picture even more unbelievable, Ketut that stood before me is a local priest in Ubud.
One morning, before inviting me to a Balinese family celebration that happens only once every 30 years, we had a talk about life. I shared that I wanted to visit a local palm reader. Sometimes when you’re desperate, you look for answers from places you never thought you would run to. ‘’I do’’ — he said, ‘’but you don’t have time for this today… have you visited The Pyramids of Chi? I think you should go’’ — said Ketut, accompanied by a witty smile, as if he almost knew what would happen there.
Like I wrote in another article, the gods always travel incognito. Ketut was convincing in an almost demanding way, leaving me with no choice but to go to those pyramids. I went to the reception and asked for a ticket for the first session available. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was in a pyramid built on top of a rice field, about to meditate to the sound of a gong. And let me tell you — I was the type of person that could never do yoga or meditate.
I still find it hard to put into words what happened to me that morning. I started having visions, one of which was a very specific necklace with a lotus flower. Once the session was over and it almost felt like I just woke up for the first time in my life, my legs took me to the giftshop. And guess what — that exact necklace I saw in my meditation was sold at their shop! I got goosebumps. A receptionist approached me and said to me ‘’Miss, this is the last necklace.’’ Nothing is a coincidence and signs do exist.
A year later, fate took me to Bali again, despite planning to go to Thailand instead. I had to go back to those pyramids again. I needed more answers. It was not an easy task to revisit a place without the burden of the expectations from the first time. However, I told myself that if those visions are a reality and not just my mind playing tricks on me, I must see the number 17 immediately when I leave the pyramid.
The sound healing was done. I ran to grab a piece of my favourite peanut butter chocolate cake and drink a comforting cup of ceremonial cacao. The woman at the counter handed me a note with a number and told me to put it on the table so they know where to bring my order. I grabbed it without looking and started playing with a frangipani flower that fell next to me. I sat down, a waiter brought my cake and to my astonishment I looked up — the table number I was given was… 17. And next to the cake the word ‘’love’’ was written with strawberry jam.
Then I went back to my homestay and Ketut asked me the mandatory question of how my day was. How do I tell this man that he sent me to a place that changed my life? I was looking for a palm reader, but I ended up being my own palm reader. What really made my jaw dropped was what Ketut asked me. ‘’Mila, do you have a partner?’’ and before I could even respond he continued — ‘’You have already met him, I saw him’’ and then with that same smile he gave me last year, he walked away and wished me good night. He saw him? What did he mean?
I don’t really have an ending for this story. An ending would imply that a cycle is completed. Yet, why does it feel like this cliffhanger by a Balinese priest is just the beginning? Or maybe I myself started this prophecy by writing my name on a wall in Italy over 14 years ago? And… what if maybe he also told me who I will marry?
Let’s connect!

Leave time for serendipity on both your travels and in your everyday life! Something I learned over the course of my time spent in Italy is that Italians love to live in the moment. As Americans, we can be so rigid with our packed schedules — it’s okay to leave room in your day for the unexpected. The more time you have left unscheduled, the more you can revel in the chance encounters you’re likely to have.
Thankfully, the world is open for travel once again. Traveling can broaden our horizons and make space for people to become more open-minded. How can travel give us the opportunity for personal growth? What are some ways that travel can help us become better human beings? As a part of our series about “How Traveling Can Help Us Become Better Human Beings”, I had the pleasure of interviewing Kathy McCabe.
Kathy McCabe makes Italian dreams come true for the millions of viewers of her popular series, Dream of Italy. With three seasons and two specials now airing on PBS, Kathy mixes authentic Italian experiences with a little bit of star power including special guests like Sting, Andrea Bocelli, Francis Ford Coppola, Marisa Tomei and Massio Bottura. The series is inspired by the award-winning travel magazine and website that Kathy founded in 2002.
Kathy’s new series, Dream of Europe, premieres on PBS stations nationwide in January 2025, bringing the winning “Dream of” formula to London, the French Alps, Malta, Greece and Albania. The new theme song to the series was recorded at the famed Abbey Road Studios where the Beatles recorded and is featured in the first episode.
Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive into the main focus of our interview, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your childhood backstory?
I began my career at ABC News in New York, where I was a desk assistant for World News Tonight with Peter Jennings and was part of the Emmy-Award winning investigative team at the network. My work at ABC led me to an opportunity in London for Worldwide Television News (WTN). Returning to the U.S., I joined USA Today, covering politics and later, travel, before starting Dream of Italy in 2002 — my award-winning travel magazine and membership website that has since become my life’s work.
My passions have always been deeply rooted in Europe, travel and writing. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (B.S.F.S) in European Studies from Georgetown University and a Master’s in Non-Fiction Writing from Johns Hopkins University.
What inspired you to launch Dream of Italy and pursue a career in inspiring others to travel?
Travel can be transformative and life-changing, and I am proof of that. The first life-changing trip I took was when my parents took me to London at the age of 10. It was my first trip abroad and it solidified my love of travel and all things European.
After college, my mother and I took a fateful trip to Italy where we rediscovered our ancestral hometown of Castelvetere sul Calore in the Irpinia area of Campania in southern Italy. During this trip, I fell in love with Italy, and during my years working in journalism, I took every vacation I could in Italy, meeting the locals, relishing in the simple joys of everyday life and taking in the stunning landscapes.
I realized that there were so many people like me who wanted to experience the authentic side of Italy, and so Dream of Italy was born in 2002 — a publication devoted to authentic luxury travel in Italy. The magazine offers insider advice on where to go, what to do, what to see, who to meet, where to stay, and where to eat in Italy. Having published more than 200 issues, which are all accessible to members, Dream of Italy, the magazine is also the springboard to my series Dream of Italy, which now has three seasons and two specials currently airing on PBS stations, the PBS app, PBS Passport, Amazon Prime and YouTube.
Along the way, I have become even more convinced of the transformative power of travel — especially travel to Italy. I realized I am in the “dream” business, not just the travel or content business. Viewers often reach out to thank me for inspiring them to pursue their own dreams. This is the most rewarding part of my work!
I really believe my commitment to deeper storytelling and exploration is what sets my content apart from other travel experts and influencers today. When done right, travel should provide opportunities for personal growth — a theme I explore in my pledge special that I produced and hosted, Dream of Italy: Travel, Transform and Thrive, which features special guests including Sting & Trudie Styler, Francis Ford Coppola, Under the Tuscan Sun author Frances Mayes.
In this special, I highlight 11 essential elements of the Italian lifestyle — land, food, family, art & culture, beauty, pace of life, passion, movement, community, celebrations, and sense of home. These themes come alive through conversations with these stars and ordinary Americans who have moved to Italy. Dream of Italy: Travel, Transform and Thrive also explores how Americans can move to Italy or spend extended time there, which has become a popular aspiration for many these days!
Is there a particular person who encouraged you to pursue your dreams and helped you reach where you are in your career?
I would have to say that my late parents, especially my mother, with whom I traveled to Italy with so often. My parents always told me to go for it and to take risks, never more so than creating and growing this Dream of Italy of mine!
They always encouraged me to follow my dreams, often sharing their own regrets about feeling tied to “safe careers” with secure pensions. They would tell me “If you want to strike out on your own, you should try.”
This was an enormous gift, I must say, to have not just one, but two people wholeheartedly believe in my dreams. It was the greatest gift of my life, and I try to pay it forward with my work. My purpose has evolved into helping others believe in their own dreams and take steps to realize them.
Can you describe a significant challenge you faced in your career? What lesson did you take away from that experience?
Well, running two businesses is full of challenges, but it has also been a journey of growth and discovery. Leading a publishing and content company for 22 years, and a production company for 10, has pushed me in ways I never would have imagined. Who would have thought I’d be running my own business, let alone two? But now, I don’t think I would have it any other way.
Most people who watch my shows don’t realize that appearing on screen accounts for probably something like less than 5% of my work hosting and producing PBS travel shows. Behind the scenes, I wear countless hats and have had to learn so many new skills (I am practically a junior trademark attorney at this point!) and push my limits constantly — even now after all these years.
I used to resist so many of these challenges for so long, but now, I almost (I said almost) welcome them, knowing they force me to grow and achieve.
What are some projects that you’re currently working on? How do you think these might inspire others to follow their own travel dreams?
I’m thrilled to share that my new travel series Dream of Europe, will premiere on PBS stations nationwide on January 18, 2025. This is my love letter to the continent I have studied, loved and explored since the age of 10. It definitely stays true to the “Dream of” formula of seeing the usual places in new ways, exploring little known destinations with a dash of star power for good measure.
Funnily enough, the first episode takes us to London where we visit the iconic Abbey Road Studios to record the theme song to the series in the studio the Beatles made famous. This is definitely the star of the season and viewers will not only go inside one of the most famous temples of music but see how a song is made.
The rest of the seven episodes explore more of the British capital, Lake Annecy in the French Alps, the enchanting island of Malta, the Greek Islands, Athens and the up-and-coming destination of Albania. There are adventures and surprises along the way as we span the culinary and cultural landscape of the European continent, from dressing up for a “Colour Walk” in London cooking with 2-Michelin star chef Jean Sulpice in France to boating out to a mussel farm in Albania.
Beyond my TV projects, I’m also currently on my own journey to obtain my Italian citizenship through ancestry and relocate to Italy either part-time or full-time. I’ve helped many viewers make this dream come true and now it is time for me to do so for me!
In your experience, why does travel foster personal growth? Can you share a specific story where travel contributed to your own growth?
It is crazy but I find that nearly every trip I have taken to Italy has challenged me to grow or changed my life. My friend Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, told me that nearly everyone, especially women, goes to Italy on a quest. That has been true of me, from my quest to find my ancestral hometown many years ago, to a more recent journey just a few years back to explore the mysterious Black Madonna of southern Italy in a very special episode for Season 3 of Dream of Italy. I even brought my late dog Phineas who ended up being an important part of the story.
The Madonna Nera herself is often associated with profound healing and transformation. This exploration of the role she has played in ancient and modern times connected me back to my own faith and ancestors, who themselves made a pilgrimage to honor the Black Madonna in Montevergine, not far from Castelvetere. This is one of the most unusual episodes I have produced and I was lucky to be joined by Black Madonna expert Alessandra Belloni and Academy Award-winning actress Marisa Tomei.
A recent Psychology Today survey revealed that over 80% of respondents believe travel helps with problem-solving and decision-making. Why do you think this is the case for so many?
Travel can transform you in every way — mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. Anything “new” for your brain to experience is proven to be a benefit and new cultures and countries offer new sights, sounds, tastes, routines, cultural experiences. In my most recent special Dream of Italy: Travel, Transform and Thrive, which is currently airing on PBS stations, I interviewed American expats on how travel and relocation impacted their lives. Many of them credited essential elements of Italian living, like access to fresh affordable food, community, art and culture, movement, and a slower pace of life, as contributing to a more fulfilling lifestyle. Whether traveling to Italy or beyond, exploring different cultures and learning more about other ways of life can inspire us to incorporate these positive influences into our daily lives.
In what ways do you think travel changes our worldview?
I think it is fascinating to see how other cultures live and what we can learn from them. A big focus of my special Dream of Italy: Travel, Transform and Thrive focuses on living and aging better the Italian way — from eating fresh, local food to enjoying community. Italians make it a point to leave time for serendipity and have perfected “dolce far niente,” or the art of doing nothing — and they’re onto something. Italy regularly ranks at the top of the Bloomberg Global Health Index as the healthiest country in the world, with Italians living longer and enjoying a rich quality of life.
No matter where you travel — and I have visited 7 countries outside of Italy this year alone for Dream of Europe — there are lessons big and small to take with you. I so enjoyed the kindness of a shopkeeper in Kotor, Montenegro, who went out of his way to help me, reminding me of the importance of kindness in everyday life. While filming on the island of Paros in May, I swear I had some of the freshest, most flavorful food of my life and made a vow to eat better and fresher at home for its health benefits. Much of my travel involved music, from attending some performances to recording the Dream of Europe theme song in the famed Abbey Road Studios in London.
What habits should one develop to turn travel into an opportunity for personal growth? Please provide a brief explanation of why each habit is important.
Leave time for serendipity on both your travels and in your everyday life! Something I learned over the course of my time spent in Italy is that Italians love to live in the moment. As Americans, we can be so rigid with our packed schedules — it’s okay to leave room in your day for the unexpected. The more time you have left unscheduled, the more you can revel in the chance encounters you’re likely to have.
Travel slowly and enjoy the place you’re in before hurrying to the next destination. Italians practice pausa, or an afternoon break — when traveling, it helps to follow suit and build in a nap or relaxation time into your itinerary. You can also make pausa a habit in your life at home.
Take what you learn from your travels home with you. This includes what I have learned from Italians: slowing down and “working to live,” not “living to work.” It also means making certain activities sacred, including taking time to eat slowly and taking your vacation days. This can be difficult in our fast-paced American culture, but being mindful of how one spends time and energy can be youth-preserving.
Is there someone in the travel now or in the past who inspires you? Who would you most like to have a one-on-one conversation with, and why?
Amelia Earhart has always fascinated me. Of course, there is the mystery of what happened when she disappeared while flying over the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to become the first female pilot to circumnavigate the world. But more than that, I am intrigued by what she achieved as a woman during the time when she lived. Being a female pilot was a radical thing, and the flights she flew were particularly dangerous. I admire her for her courage and pioneering spirit. I wonder how she dealt with fear. She broke barriers and defied societal norms at the time, inspiring generations of women to pursue their dreams without fear. This tenacity and determination are traits that I aspire to embody in my own life.

The Alps are the highest and the most extensive mountain group in Europe, extending across 8 countries: France, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia.
In this chapter, I focus on the road trip I did last year on the first nine days of May, driving from Southeast Switzerland to northern Italy, Tyrol Austria and Liechtenstein. If you prefer only to visit the Swiss Alps click here.
The last stop in Switzerland before crossing the border to Italy.
Lake Como
Driving along the lake’s road through the towns of Domaso, Menaggio, Lenno, Laglio…and at the southern tip Como, where we stayed a night.
Picturesque and romantic city
Lake Endine
A smaller lake also in Lombardy and the perfect stop to stretch our legs and have a lunch break before reaching Lake Iseo.
Lake Iseo
Views to Mont Isola at the island of Lake Iseo were breathtaking so we decided to stay here for the night.
Hiking trails connecting very small ancient villages, old churches, and olive fields with sheep and donkeys.
Lake Garda
Lazise
Bardolino and Malcesine
Riva del Garda
Famous for its beaches, swimming, sailing, windsurfing, hiking and cycling holidays. Here you can paraglide too.
The Dolomites — South Tyrol
Trento, Bolzano and Merano landscapes
Gardens of Trauttmansdorff Castle in Merano
In these gardens so carefully taken care of, you will find flora from different parts of the world, a labyrinth, educational games, experimental landscaping, a restaurant with tasty soup by the lake and views to Tyrol as a background knowing that Austria is right on the other side.
Sterzing — Vipiteno
Hiking in the morning and local market and shops in Vipiteno´s center in the afternoon before crossing the border to Austria.
“Tyrol is a western Austrian state in the Alps that’s known for its ski resorts, historic sites, and folk traditions.” Innsbruck is its capital.
Innsbruck
Ischgl
A famous ski resort, the season had ended a week before we visited it.
St. Anton am Berg villages
Feldkirch
Vaduz is the capital of Liechtenstein or officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, a small country located in an alpine valley along the Rhine river. 38,557 German-speaking inhabitants.
Vaduz
We decided to visit the city half day, walking around the center and visiting the Museum of Art: Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein and Liechtenstein National Museum. Here you discover the Arts, Crafts, and History of this micro-estate.
Italy, and the spring and first love all together should suffice to make the gloomiest person happy.
- Bertrand Russell

Departing Zermatt was unfortunate but necessary. We had seen the Matterhorn so there wasn’t anything else we could do with Yuki’s parents like hiking, biking or parasailing. We got up extra early to take the Train from Zermatt to Brig, anticipating that the 7 minute change at Brig would not be enough time. It ended up being more than enough time and after arriving an hour early, there was also a train to Domodossola, Italy, that we were able to take. There wasn’t, however, a train from Domodossola to Milano so we had to wait an hour in Domodossola instead of Brig. This wasn’t too bad because we ate another lunch of hard boiled eggs on rice and walked around the street market just outside the station.
Our initial impression of Italy was that it seemed to be a lot like Paris, only rougher with stone sidewalks and cobblestone streets. It was busy like Paris and there was clearly a wide disparity in wealth from beggars upwards unlike Switzerland which felt empty, organized, clean, and safe.
The train to Milano was very scenic. I drafted up some blog posts but also admired the beautiful scenery. Not far from Domodossola are some turquoise blue lakes and romanesque architecture with clay tile roofs that look like they could be easily centuries old. This got me exited for the next two weeks of seeing old architecture. The view became steadily less interesting as we approached more urban areas and soon we were in Milano.
Milano station was where be found out that the Italians are poor at scheduling. The train stations have large digital display boards with the departure and arrival of all the trains but they look exactly like the old school letter flipping boards. The departure platform for a train might not be displayed until 15–20 minutes before departure and that creates a mad scramble of people who were all waiting around the display board craning their necks up like weird penguins. The people swarm towards the platform, not unlike an unbalanced crowed of birds because they are all pulling along baggage. This occurs ever 5–10 minutes. When one train of people leaves, another arrives to refill the crowd around the departure board.
The train to Venice wasn’t all that interesting because it was mostly through urban areas that are noticeably modern but still in the same romanesque style of plaster brick walls and red tiled roofs. It’s actually a little like Asia; you can tell that the buildings are modern but they’re rundown and stained. To pass the time, I played the one Ipad game I’d bought for the trip, Dragonfall.
We arrived in Venice around 5pm and had a 30 minute, 2km walk to the hotel. Yuki had google mapped the route the night before and taken screen shots so that we could get there. I’m sure that it took us much longer to get to the hotel as every time we cross a canal we had to lift our suitcases over little pedestrian bridges. Between canals, we scooted down narrow alley ways that widened and narrowed like a child’s drawing who couldn’t draw straight.
Eventually we got to the hotel, tired and hungry. Checking in was straight forward and we were taken to our room around the corner that was a king bed and a folding bunk bed. Yuki and I were dejected to find out that we had booked another common room for the four of us. On our last trip to South Korea with her parents we’d been careful to book our own separate room whenever possible. For some reason, while planning this trip we forgot about that and ended up booking everything but Paris as a single room with four beds to save costs. We regretted this decision and were suddenly filled with low morale. Note to self: always book a separate room no matter the cost, It’s worth the brain cells and reduced stress.
This hotel in Venice only had wifi in the lobby and even there it was pretty crappy. I tried finding a highly rated restaurant on google maps but google doesn’t have most of the restaurants in Venice and what I found didn’t exist so we ate at the hotel’s restaurant.
The food was okay but not to our liking. We all had seafood dishes but there was very little seafood in each dish, it was mostly lobster or shrimp shell. The good part of the meal was that we got 35% off for being a guest at the hotel so the meal was pretty cheap.
Where the hotel lacked in dinner food it more than made up for at breakfast. We had an excellent self-serve buffet breakfast at the hotel that had cereal, breads, and fresh fruit. It was my favourite breakfast thus far and I finished early to take a quick walk around the end of the island we were staying at. The light had looked good for photographs but I was a little late and didn’t see anything worth photographing. On the way back to the hotel I did pass an American model and a film crew that I think they were doing a commercial.
We planned for one day in Venice to walk around as Yuki had been informed, there’s enough to do spend one day in Venice but two days would be excessive. This is because there are so many alleys, plazas, and bridges that they all blend together.
Our first stop was to get to the Plaza S. Marco. This is the most famous and the largest in Venice. We took lots of pictures and then went into the Basilica S. Marco. At the door Yuki was asked to wear a scarf because her skirt was above her knees. Other tourists were given thin blankets to cover up but beyond the lady at the door checking people none of the tourists seemed to actually bothered keeping themselves “decent”. Yuki thought it was going to be free but it was 5 Euro/person. It was worthwhile though, because at the top we got a view of the plaza from the roof. When 11 o’clock rolled around we got to watch the clock animate and brass figurines hit the bells to ring them.
As it was Sunday, there was a service in the main hall. There was a choir and a lot of singing that sounded wonderful in the cavernous space. This Basilica was more interesting than Norte Dame because it also had a museum where we could get up close to some of the artwork. The entire interior of the cathedral is covered in little tiles, most of which is backgrounded in gold. Though the museum signs have english, it didn’t make a lot of sense so after a while we stopped reading them and instead stood in the main hall to listen to the music of the mass.
Around the corner from the Plaza S. Marco we found a small gelato store and got two scoops on a cone. The Gelato here was incredible and significantly tastier, smoother and better than Canada. This shouldn’t have be a surprise, given that gelato originated in Italy, but it wasn’t something that I had expected before taking my first lick.
Wandering on, we crossed the famous Rialto bridge and then had lunch at an outdoor cafe beside the canal. The food was pretty good. Yuki had lasagna and I had a spinach salad with dried fruits, bacon, and a really interesting cheese. We also ordered Spritz Apoele, a popular drink in Italy that everyone seemed to be drinking. It wasn’t my favourite but it wasn’t bad either.
After lunch we headed towards the train station to get tickets for the next day’s train, stopping for more gelato on the way. We were very grateful to have the help of a young woman with the ticket machine and decided to also get most of our other tickets for the trip because we had her to guide us through the process. This girl was really helpful and turned what could have been a very frustrating and difficult situation into an understandable time.
For future reference, its best to book train tickets at least two days in advance. The prices are cheaper by a significant amount and the train isn’t full yet. The day before or the day of, tickets are more expensive and seating is difficult to find.
From the train station we walked back to the hotel and had a brief rest. When we were hungry, we went out and walked the streets again in search of a good restaurant. The cafe restaurant we choose had a good proportion of food and lost of seafood in the dish but the ambience wasn’t as nice. Still, I enjoyed the meal and the 1/2 bottle of white wine I ordered. Yuki had to help me finish it.
We had another great breakfast at the hotel and then left early for the train station to ensure that our slowness did not make us late. Leaving Venice was a lot easier than arriving. On the way back to the hotel the day before I’d found a route that had ramps over the bridges so we were able to return to the train station with half of the bridges turned into ramps and fewer canals to carry our bags over than before.
We arrived 40 minutes early and waited for the train platform. Annoyingly, the car numbers on the side of the train were different from the TV screens on the platform so we and several others got on the wrong car. We were able to get off and onto the right car with a little stress and hassle and were happy to be settle into our seats for the journey back to Milano.
The train was 30 minutes late because of some police incident so we only had around 15 minutes to change trains in Milano. When we got on the train, Yuki’s bag was open, an unsuccessful attempt at a pickpocket, and somehow papers from Yuki’s Dad’s inside breast pocket ended up on the table. I think there were two girls that opened Yuki’s bag while we were getting on the train and when we got to our seats, instead of sitting down to get out of everyone’s way Yuki’s Dad stepped right in the middle of the crowd and those two girls took the papers out but then left them on the table because they weren’t valuable.
We double checked our valuables a nothing was gone so that was good. The rest of the train ride to Levanto was mostly uneventful. We chatted with an Australian couple and anguished over not having any food so we were quite hungry when we arrived in Levanto around 5pm. We talked with the tourist office and got a map to walk to the hotel. It turns out that the hotel is run by a travel agency that also manages a B&B and a few apartments. For unknown reasons they upgraded us from a studio hotel to a one bedroom apartment with the ocean view. This was a huge boost to our morale and made us very happy.
The apartment was on the third floor and had a balcony with a view of the beach and the ocean. It was particularly nice to sit out and watch the sunset. The apartment also gave Yuki and I a private room and there was a much needed laundry machine that we used daily during our stay.
Internet was interesting, they gave us a portable modem with a little battery. I suspect that it ran on data and could, conceivably, be taken out to the beach or where ever but we left it plugged in beside the bed.
I’d asked the lady from the travel agency for a good restaurant and she recommended the one across the street so we went there for dinner. It was without a doubt the best meal so far. I had 5 grilled shrimp, Yuki had seafood ravioli and Yuki’s dad had the best mixed seafood calamari ever. To top it off, I had a great 1/2 bottle of white wine and Yuki got a very sweet white wine that her dad finished in two swings. We should have gotten more of that wine because we weren’t able to find it again.

Stepping off the plane in Rome felt like diving into a living, breathing history lesson drenched in vibrant modernity. The first thing that struck me was the timeless grandeur of the architecture — ancient ruins stood majestically beside chic boutiques and lively cafes. As I strolled through the bustling streets, I encountered a fascinating blend of people: tourists eagerly snapping photos at the Colosseum, locals animatedly chatting in small piazzas, and street performers adding an artistic flair to the atmosphere. The hum of scooters zipping by and the welcoming aroma of freshly baked pizza were a sensory delight. I managed my expenses well, finding accommodations in a charming mid-range B&B for around €80 a night and enjoying delicious meals for approximately €10-€20 per meal.
During an early morning exploration, the usually crowded Trevi Fountain was serene and almost ethereal in the soft dawn light. It was then that I met a couple from Argentina, and we shared our travel stories over espresso, marveling at the fusion of Rome’s ancient roots with its contemporary vibe. The energy shifted noticeably during the off-hours; the city seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, offering a more intimate glimpse into its heart. This visit made me appreciate how Rome thrives on its contrasts — tradition and modernity, hustle and tranquility — all of which are seamlessly woven together in its cultural tapestry. This immersion deepened my admiration for the city and gave me a richer understanding of its unique social fabric.
Exploring Venice felt like stepping into a living painting. The narrow, winding streets blend seamlessly with majestic canals, buzzing with vaporettos and gondolas. At every corner, there’s a mix of excited tourists and locals casually sipping espressos or chatting in lilting Italian. With a budget of €50 a day, I savored delicious cicchetti at vibrant bacari, sipping Spritz Aperol and marveling over Saint Mark’s Basilica’s intricate mosaics. The blend of ancient architecture and contemporary life is stunning. Venice is both a historical marvel and a hub of modern energy.
Dawn strolls across the Rialto Bridge, practically deserted, offered me quiet moments to soak in the serene beauty. One delightful incident involved a cheerful American couple who, upon sharing their map, eagerly guided me to the lesser-known Fondaco dei Tedeschi terrace. We debated the best gelato flavors while marveling at the panoramic view. Interactions like these made me realize how Venice serves as a meeting point of cultures, fostering camaraderie among strangers. The trip deepened my appreciation for how Venetians preserve their rich heritage while embracing the cosmopolitan vibe — it’s a city where tradition beautifully dances with modernity. Can’t wait for your stories!
Upon arriving in Florence, the city greeted me with an intoxicating mix of history and vibrant modern life. The cobblestone streets whispered tales of the Renaissance as Vespa scooters buzzed by, creating a lively, eclectic atmosphere. Walking towards the heart of the city, I marveled at the grandeur of the Duomo, its pink and green marble facade glistening in the sunlight. The bustling Piazza della Signoria was a feast for the senses — gelato shops with their rainbow assortments, the grandeur of Palazzo Vecchio, and street musicians playing classical melodies. With my stepping counter enthusiastically tallying more than 15,000 steps, I felt every euro spent was worth it — entrance fees to museums (€15–20 each) and delicious meals at cozy trattorias (€10–15 per meal).
As evening fell, the city transformed into a romantically lit wonderland. Less crowded now, I wandered along the banks of the Arno River, the Ponte Vecchio glowing under the streetlights. I struck up a conversation with a couple from Brazil at a quaint wine bar, and we swapped travel stories over a glass of Chianti (€5). The blend of tradition met modernity beautifully here, from historic architecture to chic boutiques. This juxtaposition deepened my appreciation for the city’s dynamic character. Florence isn’t just a relic of the past; it’s a living, breathing city, full of creativity and life. My experience was an eye-opener to the cultural depth of Florence, where each encounter, be it with locals or fellow travelers, is a brushstroke in a rich, colorful canvas.
Walking through Milan feels like stepping into a living blend of history and modernity. My visit began at the awe-inspiring Duomo di Milano, a gothic cathedral that pierced the sky with its spires. As I marveled at its intricate facades, the bustling Piazza del Duomo spread before me, where chic locals mingled with eager tourists. The energy was palpable, with street performers adding to the vibrant ambiance. For a reasonable 10 euros, I ascended to the rooftop, where the city’s panorama offered glimpses of both medieval structures and contemporary skyscrapers. I’ve never felt such a unique blend of past and present.
Exploring the streets, I encountered high-end fashion boutiques nestled beside centuries-old cafes, symbolizing Milan’s knack for harmonizing tradition with the avant-garde. An evening aperitivo in the Navigli district was an unforgettable experience — think canal-side bars with a backdrop of golden sunsets, a spread of delicious appetizers for just 12 euros, and lively conversations with fellow travelers from all over the world. I exchanged stories with an architect from Tokyo who came to Milan to study its renowned design styles. These interactions and the city’s dynamic atmosphere deepened my appreciation for Milan’s role as a global cultural hub. Even during the quieter hours, the city’s spirit remained vibrant, resonating with the whispers of history intertwined with the buzz of contemporary life.
Naples, ah, what an unforgettable adventure it was! Stepping off the train, the city welcomed me with its vibrant and bustling energy. The air felt electric, rich with the smell of fresh pizza wafting through narrow, cobblestone streets lined with Vespas and ancient buildings, effortlessly blending the old with the new. I found myself among a varied crowd — from stylishly dressed locals to backpacking tourists, all contributing to a chaotic, yet harmonious atmosphere. A slice of authentic Margherita pizza cost me a modest 4 euros and was worth every penny. As I meandered through the cities alleyways, I stumbled upon an impromptu street performance that turned a casual evening into a lively, shared experience, underscoring Naples’ vibrant social culture.
During quieter moments, like early mornings before the city fully awakes, I could almost hear the whispers of history amidst the stillness. Walking along the waterfront, with Mount Vesuvius majestically framing the skyline, I felt a mixture of awe and peace. An encounter with a friendly fellow traveler at a small, family-run café led to an intriguing conversation about Naples’ transformation over the years. Their insights into the juxtaposition of the city’s time-honored traditions with modern flair deepened my appreciation for Naples’ unique character — a city where past and present coexist in perfect symphony. Whether exploring the ancient ruins of Pompeii just a train ride away, or marveling at contemporary street art, Naples enchanted me with its seamless blend of history, culture, and vitality.
Stepping into Amalfi felt like walking straight into a living postcard. Nestled between the rugged cliffs and cerulean waters, the town exudes both nostalgia and vibrant energy. The atmosphere was intoxicating — sun-drenched piazzas brimming with locals and tourists alike, mingling as the scent of fresh lemon groves wafted through the air. With a budget of around €120 per day, I managed to grab gelato on the bustling main street and watched as couples and families chatter animatedly over espresso at sidewalk cafes. The quaint shops boasted everything from hand-painted ceramics to luxurious silk scarves, standing as a testament to Amalfi’s seamless blend of tradition with modern splendor.
Despite the lively crowds, there were tranquil moments during the early morning and late afternoon. Wandering through the narrow alleyways when they were almost deserted, I felt an intimate connection to the soul of the town. An elder local, noticing my curiosity about the stunning Duomo di Sant’Andrea, shared tales of the cathedral’s storied past, enriching my appreciation for its architectural grandeur. As evening fell, I joined a group of fellow travelers at a small trattoria where we feasted on fresh seafood and homemade pasta for less than €30 each. Our conversations flowed effortlessly, bridging diverse backgrounds and languages. This encounter illuminated Amalfi’s unique charm — a place where time-honored traditions coexist with the thriving pulse of contemporary life, fostering a deep sense of belonging and community. My visit wasn’t just a trip; it was a gateway to understanding the rich, multifaceted culture of Amalfi.
Stepping off the train at Sorrento felt like walking into a sun-drenched painting. The narrow streets burst with vibrant colors — blue and yellow tiles lining the walls, vivid bougainvillea spilling over canopies. The air was a divine blend of citrus and sea salt, creating an intoxicating atmosphere that was both grounding and exhilarating. I strolled along the bustling Piazza Tasso, where locals and tourists melded in a lively dance of conversation. For just about 15 Euros, I enjoyed the creamiest gelato as I soaked in the scene — a symphony of clinking glasses, laughing children, and the occasional Vespa zipping by. The town harmonizes timeworn traditions with modern charm effortlessly, from ancient architecture to chic cafes.
Off-hours revealed a quieter, more contemplative side of Sorrento. Early mornings were my favorite, as I wandered the virtually empty Marina Grande. The fishermen were returning with their catch, exchanging hearty greetings in musical Neapolitan dialects. A friendly local named Marco invited me to join a small group savoring freshly-cooked seafood — free of charge! His stories of Sorrento’s history deepened my appreciation for the town’s timeless energy. Interacting with other visitors from around the globe, I relished discussions that ranged from travel tips to cultural insights. This unexpected camaraderie made me realize how Sorrento is not just a destination but a confluence of life, tradition, and modern pleasures that bring people together.
Walking through the cobblestone streets of Verona, the city feels alive with history and a touch of romantic whimsy. The air is filled with the soft hum of conversation, a symphony of Italian laced with laughter and the clang of espresso cups at corner cafes. The first thing that captures my attention is the Arena di Verona, an ancient Roman amphitheater that stands testament to both Verona’s past and its vibrant present as it still hosts operas and concerts. With a budget of around €30 for a guided tour and another €15 for a cappuccino and pastry at a charming café, I felt like I was living in a dream. The blend of medieval architecture with chic boutiques and restaurants painted a vivid contrast of tradition and modernity.
As the evening sun dipped below the horizon, I wandered into a quaint piazza where locals gathered for aperitivo. The mix of people — from elderly couples to young professionals and curious tourists like myself — added a rich tapestry of stories and energy. Striking up a conversation with a fellow traveler from Brazil, we shared thoughts on Juliet’s House and whether touching her statue really brings love luck. As the night deepened, so did my appreciation for Verona’s fusion of past and present; its traditional roots were palpable even as the city embraced a contemporary, globalized spirit. This visit wasn’t just a sightseeing trip; it was a soulful dive into a culture that balances heritage and modernity with grace and flair. If you’re planning your trip, set aside some time to simply absorb and enjoy Verona’s unique vibe.
Walking through the charming streets of Bologna, I felt like I had stepped into a living, breathing museum. The terracotta-roofed buildings, medieval towers, and long porticoes painting a fascinating blend of the old and new. The energy was palpable as locals darted through Piazza Maggiore on their morning errands while tourists marveled at the Basilica di San Petronio. I joined in, exploring on foot, and ended up having an impromptu coffee chat with a group of friendly university students. They introduced me to the best gelato in town, costing only €2.50, and shared stories of studying in this historic yet dynamic city.
As the day turned into night, Bologna transformed. The streets bustled with an eclectic mix of people — young professionals unwinding after work, street performers enchanting passersby, and elderly couples strolling hand in hand. Dinner at a local trattoria, where I spent about €15 for a plate of tagliatelle al ragù, was an absolute delight. It was here that I met a Dutch couple who were on a culinary tour of Italy. Our lively conversation about Bolognese traditions versus their modern aspirations gave me a deeper appreciation for Bologna’s unique character. By the late evening, as the city quieted down, I appreciated the serene yet lively ambiance that made Bologna feel like a timeless gem waiting to be discovered over and over again.
Imagine stepping into a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors and intoxicating sounds as you walk through the bustling streets of Palermo. The aroma of freshly baked sfincione — a local-style pizza — mingles with the scent of citrus from the vendors at the Ballarò Market. With a modest budget of €50 a day, I indulged in street food, savored an espresso at an alfresco café, and soaked up the local atmosphere. The streets were a lively mix of tourists and locals, each bringing their unique flair to the city’s intricate mosaic. The chatter in various dialects, combined with the honking of scooters zipping through narrow alleys, created a symphony that was quintessentially Palermo.
By evening, the city transitioned into a different rhythm. The grand Teatro Massimo was serenely lit, casting a majestic glow over the piazza. I met a fellow traveler from Argentina, and we shared our awe over Palermo’s confluence of ancient history and modern vitality. Wandering through the charming streets after hours, I marveled at how the city retained its old-world charm amidst modern cafes and boutiques. This visit truly deepened my appreciation for Palermo’s unique blend of tradition and innovation, making it a city that’s as timeless as it is contemporary. If you’re planning to visit, do spend an evening chatting with locals to fully savor this rich cultural tapestry.

This article was originally published in Spanish and you are invited to read it as well in my beautiful language here
I am not a psychologist. I could read a bunch of books to find answers to questions like why we enjoy dreaming, and why we love idealizing places, people, and situations… but I’m too lazy to do that.
All I know is that if you idealize your life, it’s probably because you like living in a self-generated Matrix avoiding some problem, denying it, or worse, you’ve always lived that way.
Nowadays, however, we have a huge choice of online resources, and it’s possible to get a real sense of what a place might be like: ideal for living or vacationing, boring or lively, safe or dangerous. You have the chance to even interact with its inhabitants long distance or, simply ask travelers about their experiences.
A few months ago a video of a girl went viral because she was complaining about how to get to Amalfi. She said she had to fly to Naples, take a train to Sorrento, a ferry to Amalfi, and finally climb lots of stairs to reach her hotel — all this in the height of summer, with that heat! Can you believe it?
She said influencers should be jailed for saying things that aren’t true… (deep breath…)
Here’s the thing: living is easy with eyes closed, but today you don’t have excuses. You have to be in the here and now. Whether it’s Instagram, YouTube, a book, or an article, you must remember that someone’s version of a place or an experience is subjective and probably idealized. You need to be aware that what you’re being sold on social media is either driven by economic convenience or because the person in question is feeding their delusion, trying to rope others into their fantasy.
You can’t plan your vacations, your life, or your career based on the ideas others give you. You have to go out into the world, connect with people, try, smell, ask, think critically, question, and then decide what to think, how to act, what to do, and where to go.
Mistakes are always lurking around the corner — you should always keep that in mind — but I can assure you that you’ll feel less frustrated knowing that you did everything yourself and consciously made the effort for your project to succeed.
Having said all this, I imagine you now understand why I said “No” in response to the title of this article.
But maybe I’m not so good at explaining my thesis, so here it is:
No, it’s not beautiful in Italy or anywhere else if you’ve decided to see life through filters, through the eyes of others — call them dream sellers, rich kids who study or live abroad, or immigrants who haven’t adapted to a new lifestyle or who’ve endured years of bitterness before achieving a decent standard of living and showing it off to you.
Life is beautiful only when you look at it with your own eyes and your ideas. It’s beautiful with both the good and the bad — not just when you see it through the Deep Summer filter.
Wake up!

This is the third time in my life that I have been a tourist. The first time was in 1975 when I was traveling with a guy, and he was a tourist. I had hitched a ride, and he wanted to see the Eifel Tower, Notre Dame and the cathedral in Cologne. He also wanted to eat pastries — I found it bizarre. We parted company, and I found another ride. Thankfully, it was less than a week.
The second time was with my daughter last December when we went to Valencia together. We had (and have) very different ideas of what travel means. For me, it means skipping all the tourist places, wondering around the streets with a camera — walking for many miles each day, just looking at the buildings and the people. For my daughter, it means going to museums and other tourist attractions. For her, it mean eating in restaurants to try out new tastes. For me, it means going to the grocers, buying tinned sardines, a bread roll, and keeping food cheap and healthy. I’ve no interest in eating out.
And then there’s now.
Each January, there are travel sales. Ryanair was offering return tickets to Rome for €30. I thought I would take advantage of that, although I’ve never had the slightest interest in either Rome or Italy. As a…

Italy is often celebrated for its timeless art, history, and cuisine, but what truly makes this country special are the smaller, quieter experiences that usually go unnoticed. As an expat living amidst the Alps, I’ve discovered that there are countless opportunities to connect with nature, local traditions, and the changing seasons even in regions famed for their tourist attractions.
I forgot to tell you about my favourite event of the year here in the Alps: the narcissus flowering. There is something magical about seeing infinite meadows and feeling their perfume… By the way, I have a problem: I do not support many odors but the scent of narcissus I like and that is why I can say you that there is a big difference between the flowers that were 50 years ago and today: many flowers (and narcissus among them) do not have their fantastic profume they had when I was a girl.

I took a three-day trip to Italy on New Years. It was always my dream to visit the great Ancient Rome, so you can imagine how excited I was for this trip. Throughout my visit, I experienced some wonderful places, great food, and met new people. I want to share with you the rookie mistakes that I made, the things I did right, and ultimately what I learned from this experience. Here are some tips for navigating your way through the beautiful city of Rome.
Pack well (and right!!): Extra clothes, check, portable charger, check, type C, F, and L power outlet plugs, not check. Seriously, I spent the first half of my day there looking for electronic stores with the correct power outlet adapters. I made a rookie mistake, and hopefully, you will not have to.
Don’t pay extra. If anyone tries to convince you that you have to pay to get into the Vatican, I will assure you that you don’t. As soon as I arrived at the Vatican, I was unpleasantly approached by a man who apparently had only two tickets left to sell for the Vatican. Most might think that they “got lucky” and that they had just made it there in time before tickets were sold out, but that isn’t the case at all. Just keep your head up and walk right into the Vatican. It’s free. Thankfully, binge-watching travel videos on youtube helped me with that one.
Take lots of pictures. If you are traveling along, you can even ask tourists to take photos of you! As a solo traveler, I had plenty of time to soak in all the views and take my time appreciating all the sights and wonders. It is nice to take some pictures so you can reminisce later (who knows when you’ll be back). If you want to take some pictures of yourself, ask tourists if they’d be willing to take it for you, you’d be surprised how much photography talent there is in the crowd. If you see someone who could use a hand, offer to help them take their picture, they might offer to take yours back. Well, hey, it worked for me.
Plan well! I packed my day with wonderful sightseeing adventures and activities. It is crucial to check openings of the different places, especially on holidays. Unfortunately, I missed out on the great opportunity of seeing the Sistine Chapel because it was closed on the new year.
Throw a coin (or two) into the Trevi Garden. Legend has it that if you throw a coin over your head into the Trevi Fountain, chances are, you will return to Rome. If you throw two, you will return to Rome and fall in love, and three, you will return to Rome, fall in love, and get married there. I don’t know if this has been proven correct, but it can’t hurt to take your chances either way. Unluckily, I didn’t get to throw coins into the fountain, but have no doubt; I shall return.
Check out what Italy is known for, then make sure not to miss out. I enjoyed some delicious Italian Ice Cream, Pizza, and House Wine. The wine is incredibly affordable in Italy. While in the restaurant, don’t rush to receive the bill. It is customary in Italy to stick around and have a conversation after a nice meal.
Fly Ryanair! This one is a little bit controversial. If you asked me then if I would fly Ryanair again, I would have said that I would absolutely not. Looking back though, I realize how convenient it was to have a cheap flight from London to Rome. Just make sure you read exactly what you need to do when buying the ticket so they won’t charge you extra for late check-in or carry-on bags. If you don’t want to experience flight delays though, don’t fly with Ryanair. They might have cheaper flights, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost.
I hope asome of these travelling tips helped you out! I know that I need to take some of my own advice on my next trip to Rome.
Edit: This blog is a repost from 3 years ago when I first visited Rome. Hope you enjoy!

“Why are there so many tourist scammers? In the EU? How is that possible?!” I find myself pondering as I sit on a bench at Capitoline Hill in Rome, having just dismissed the fifth “salesman” hawking water/hats/bracelets/ whatever in the span of ten minutes. Perhaps equally surprising is the police who keep a few meters away but do not intervene.
“Consider this — by selling three bracelets they have an average hourly rate that could rival a much harder job in Glovo or something,” remarks my boyfriend having recently engaged in a lively argument with a guy offering him an African souvenir for free, which later suddenly appeared to cost “at least something”.
“But it’s illegal! It’s immoral! Do they have any respect for Italian culture? Or to humans at all? I simply couldn’t look up to the Colosseum because another guy f****d my mind forcing us to buy a ticket for the hop-on-hop-off bus!” I exclaim, my emotions getting the better of me. However, the worst was their pre-prepared reaction to every answer to the question “Where are you from?” My bad, I replied I was from Ukraine — and then they transformed the historic “Slava Ukraini” (“Glory to Ukraine”) into a cheap plea for me to…

Italy and Japan are also in a similar situation. Yet in Italy for example, Spain and other countries, there are entire villages with mostly empty houses; the state even pays foreigners to move there. Distance working enabled by excellent fiber optic connectivity to rural areas has to be a big part of the solution; I don’t see many others.

My family rented two Polestar 2 cars for a week long jaunt from Rome to Florence and around the Tuscan countryside, where we stayed at a beautiful villa for five nights, for a total around 1000 km. The catch was that the villa was sited for gorgeous views at the peak of a local hill on a farm that was accessed by 4–5 km of gravel road, depending on direction of approach. We obtained fast DC charging on the highway away from and back to Rome (more later), but there was no convenient fast charging near the villa.
The Polestars came with an EU wall outlet charging cable, so we were intent upon charging from outlets just inside the front and rear doors. Fortunately, the proprietors left out two grounding plug adaptors that mated with the Polestars’ cable, and we were off. Both outlets were on a single breaker, so only one car could be charged at a time, but at 2.3 kW, wall charging is faster than in the USA, and we were able to share the juice and obtain enough for extensive day trips in Tuscany. The catch was that the owners were unhappy with our solution on grounds that it violates their solar array agreement, which specifies “agricultural uses”. They did accept a nominal payment in compensation, however. We of course argued that they would benefit from offering this as a feature in their AirBnB listing.
On the highway, we charged at an Enel X charger at a shopping center, which offered only one 50 kW DC fast charging spigot with 5 slower Level 2 spigots. This was typical of most charging stations across Italy. So we had to time-share the two cars between a fast and a slow spigot, which seemed absurd coming from our experience with Tesla superchargers featuring at least 4–8 100–200 kW spigots per installation. A second session at a Evviva charging station benefitted from four fast spigots, but the initial 140 kW soon dropped to 70 kW when the second car was added.
Thankfully, the Evviva station recognized our Enel X app, but this was not at all apparent without some coaching from another EV driver who was incredibly helpful. The onboarding for Enel X charging had been quite painful, requiring download of an app, entry of quite a bit of personal information, and manual entry of credit card information. My attempt to register for an account was unsuccessful on three successive tries, but I was able to pay as guest, and the app put me in good shape for later charging on the Evviva chargers. But here’s the question:
Why is it possible to purchase fuel at most any gas station using only a credit card reader, but not at an EV charger? Who is blocking the adoption of a modern process for entering only the most rudimentary validating information (e.g. zip code), or more recently, simply tapping a card or a phone, without the frustrations of downloading apps or entering extensive personal information to set up “accounts” that are totally unnecessary?
For heaven’s sake, give me a charge and TAKE MY MONEY, already! We don’t owe you a database.

While it may seem obvious, if you do not already speak Italian to some degree, you will really need to buckle down and make learning the language your number one priority when you move permanently to Italy, as not being able to communicate freely with Italians could create some very challenging situations.
Recently, I spoke with an English-speaking foreigner who relocated to Italy approximately five years ago. Despite their limited knowledge of Italian, they made minimal efforts to enhance their language skills during this time. Unfortunately, this individual developed an illness that required communicating with multiple doctors. Due to the language barriers faced by the foreigner and the limited English spoken by the medical professionals, the individual believed they received a misdiagnosis and may now face a permanent health issue due to their inability to understand the doctors’ diagnosis. Of course, there are two sides to the story, and without being present, one cannot know for sure what truly transpired, but one thing is for sure: not being able to speak Italian to a certain level certainly caused stress, worry, and a sense of isolation. This episode was such a negative experience for this person that they decided to leave Italy permanently.
Unfortunately, when I moved to Italy, I had no idea that it would become my permanent home. Had I known this, I would have arrived in Italy with a more extensive vocabulary than just ‘ciao’ and ‘grazie’. My first two years in Italy were particularly challenging because I didn’t have a solid grasp of Italian. This meant that I had to either seek out services where people spoke English, which often came at a premium, or I literally had to go around with a dictionary. Of course, with the advent of apps on one’s phone that can translate for you, things have become much easier. However convenient this can be, there is nothing, in my opinion, like being able to freely converse with another person.
The internet is now filled with articles that promote living a laid-back life in one of Italy’s small towns, where one can take advantage of the 7% tax program. However, given that these towns are made up of 20.000 or fewer inhabitants, and that many have older populations, it is safe to say that finding people who speak English may be rarer than a hen’s teeth. This could, despite one being happy with their life in such a town, lead to feelings of isolation if you do not speak Italian well enough to be able to hold a conversation, albeit a simple one, especially at the beginning. In addition to this, we, as foreigners who have chosen to make Italy our home, owe it to Italians to make the best effort we can to learn their language.
While Italians may be forgiving when you learn their language and make mistakes, there is no doubt that they truly appreciate it when a foreigner makes a genuine effort to learn Italian. This is particularly true in a business setting, where the Italian spoken can often be very formal. As a result, Italians generally value the ability of a foreigner to express themselves effectively in Italian and who fully understands the use of ‘Lei’ and ‘Tu’ in this context.
It is fair to say that some people and certain nationalities seem to be more gifted at learning languages, and the same is also true of Italian. That said, we owe it to ourselves, as well as to Italians, to learn the language as well as we possibly can, and here are five reasons why we should do that.
If the above five reasons are not enough, believe me when I say that you do not want to have a root canal, for example, or some other medical procedure if you do not fully understand the medical professional. You also don’t want to talk with an Italian accountant if you don’t understand completely what they’re saying. In addition to this, bonding with Italians and creating lifelong friendships are much easier if you can speak to them in their own language.
Learning Italian can take time and patience, but the rewards will be worth it. Don’t keep putting it off; start today. Even learning just one new word a day means you have learned three hundred and sixty-five new words in a year!

If you’re someone who daydreams about chasing la dolce vita, you should know that while many of us adore living in Italy, this country has plenty of problems. Some of these problems show signs of fixing, and others will likely take generations of cultural and behavioral changes to resolve.
Here are some particular reasons not to move to Italy, or at least reasons to keep in mind before doing so.
I once dated a kind, educated Italian man in his late 20s who seemed to say all the right things. He was vegetarian, had been to therapy, had healthy boundaries with his parents, and was a self-proclaimed feminist.
What a score! I thought to myself.
Unfortunately, he also thought it was appropriate to rank potential female hires by how hot they were. He sincerely thought that I’d enjoy hearing about how he and his male coworker — in their male-dominated Italian office, within a male-dominated industry — had added an extra column in their hiring spreadsheet to rank potential female hires as “hot”, “not hot”, or “maybe hot”.

There’s a particular kind of silence that follows the clatter of train wheels on tracks. It’s not empty — it hums with promise, like a deep breath held between moments. That’s how it felt while traveling between Florence and Venice, as the Tuscan hills transitioned into marshy, mystical flatlands. I looked out the window and realized the experience wasn’t just a trip. It was a soft reset.
We came to Italy looking for beauty, pasta, and a break from our over-scheduled lives. What we found was something we hadn’t planned for: space. We found space to think, to wander, and to breathe again.
The idea was simple: seven days in Italy, three cities, one Eurail pass, and zero stress. The itinerary included Rome, Florence, and Venice. A golden triangle of beauty, history, carbs, and vino.
Easy, right?
We even had a spreadsheet with color-coded tabs. Arrival times, museum hours, restaurant reservations, walking distances, and estimated energy levels. I had even listed “snack breaks,” as if spontaneity needed a time slot.
Naturally, on our first day in Rome, our Google Maps history resembled a marathon. We chased every “top 10” list. We reached…

Last year I went on a month-long journey through the North of Italy. In this article, I want to share some of the highlights that I made on the tour. Additionally, I thought I’d complement my own thoughts with impressions of German writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who visited Italy from 1786 to 1788.
My journey began in Milan, which is the second largest city in Italy after Rome. My first impression of the city was a bit disappointing as I perceived it as quite dirty and ran down. Maybe this was due to the fact that my hostel was located next to the main station, which is not the best area in town.
The hostel itself, however, was very nice. I would do a lot of exploring around the center of the city. Two of the main sites are the Milan Cathedral and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The former was built in 1386, and I highly recommend taking a tour through the Cathedral, including the rooftop.
The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is Italy’s oldest active shopping gallery. It stands out due to its high ceilings, the glass dome in the center, and its luxurious shops and restaurants within the gallery. I found the architecture very fascinating, although it is obviously overrun by tourists.
After a short stay in Bergamo, I headed out to Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliett. Verona has a nice Mediterranean vibe and is home to the Verona Arena, one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheaters.
It was built in 30 AD and is still in use today. Goethe wrote about the amphitheater:
“The simplicity of the oval is palpable to every eye in the most pleasant way, and every head serves as a measure of how enormous the whole is. Now, when you see it empty, you have no measure; you do not know whether it is big or small.”
Although the amphitheater is one of the city’s main attractions, what stood out to me was the general architecture you can find throughout the city. There is a beautiful hill, home to the Castel San Pietro, from which you are able to overlook the city.
Lake Garda, which is easily reachable from Verona, was my next stop. What stood out to me was the panoramic view, with the majestical mountains of the Alps in the background. Goethe was also enraptured by this view:
“How much do I wish that my friends were with me for a moment to enjoy the prospect, which now lies before my eyes. I might have been in Verona this evening, but a magnificent natural phenomenon was in my vicinity — Lake Garda, a splendid spectacle, which I did not want to miss, and now I am nobly rewarded for taking this circuitous route.”
I stayed in a small town called Desenzano del Garda, which is a great hub for exploring the surrounding areas. Even in late October, you are able to enjoy some hours at the lake’s beaches.
My next stop on the list was Venice — a town I have seen so many times in various movies but never in person. So as soon as I left the train station and saw the canal in the beautiful sunshine, I had a big smile on my face. I stayed in a hostel called the Generator, which is located on one of the smaller side islands but offers a great view of the city.
Now, Venice really is a place of its own. You do not need to visit museums or galleries because the city itself is a piece of art. It gained wealth and power between the 9th and 12th centuries and had another very influential phase during the Renaissance. The boats, the houses, the canals. Everything in Venice feels magical, and you could easily believe that the city is a well-constructed theme park.
Note, however, that many tourists are moving through the narrow alleys of which Goethe wrote:
“After dinner, I hurried to first get an impression of the whole, and threw myself (…) into the labyrinth of the city, which, although intersected by canals and small channels, is connected again by bridges and small bridges. One cannot imagine the narrowness and crowdedness of the whole without having seen it.”
After I left Venice and spent one night in Bologna, I headed further south to Florence. Now, if you’re a fan of DaVinci, Michelangelo, or art in general, this city is a must-see! Although I was already a bit tired of the hustling and bustling of all the cities I’d seen, I managed to visit the Uffizi, which hosts one of the most important collections of the Renaissance era.
What I enjoyed even more in Florence was the community kitchen of my hostel — the Yellow Square. Every night a committed group of travelers would gather in the kitchen and share meals and stories of their day. Furthermore, the hostel has a nice rooftop terrace from where you can overlook the city.
Finally, it was time for me to head out into nature. I went to a place called LaVerna — an old, mystical monastery that is located on the top of a mountain. From there, I would start on a week-long pilgrimage along the way of St. Francis, which ultimately led me to the town of his birth, Assisi.

The morning started off with my phone having not charged during the night. Then as we rushed out of the house I realised I had forgotten it.
Fortunately just a minor inconvenience as I’d only gone a few metres before patting my pockets and realising I didn’t have it. But now the battery was low and we needed the phone for our journey. Rail tickets, buying metro tickets, plane boarding passes and Uber on arrival.
This trip was just a short 6 day visit to Italy — 3 days in Rome and 3 days in Florence. The occasion, celebrating the 80th birthday of Roger, our long time round the world travelling companion, who was coming from South Africa to Italy to celebrate his birthday with his family in Venice.
As my phone charge was low I used the time on the train from Aveiro to Porto to charge it. But as I gathered my extra jacket and luggage the phone fell on the floor.
I didn’t realise I didn’t have it until I needed it to pay for the metro tickets. Frantic patting and searching was in vain. It was on the train on the way to Spain!
After explaining my predicament to Sara at the Campanha station ticket office, she immediately contacted…

This was originally published on The Unexplorer.
Under the Tuscan Sun. Eat, Pray, Love. If these books are anthems that sing of your dreams of moving to Italy, join the club.
And yet, while many women (myself included) do successfully create a new life in the land of pasta and prosecco, many others return to their homeland after just a few months or years, unable to rectify the dream with the reality of living in Italy.
Before you sell everything you own and buy a one-way ticket, here are a few reasons you might want to reconsider this plan.
I get it. Politics/the economy/[insert something else here] suck where you live. You’re dreaming of escaping the rat race for a better life in Italy.
But I’ll tell you a secret: things aren’t perfect in Italy either. In the south, there’s an extremely high unemployment rate (15% versus a national average of 8.2%). Politics are wonky here too, depending on your leanings. Oh, and then there’s the mafia.
When you run away from what you consider a less-than-ideal life, you aren’t setting yourself up for success in your new home. And as you know, problems follow you.

How much do medicines cost to develop? The answer to this critical question is that we don’t know. What we do know is that the lack of transparency and secrecy surrounding these costs allows pharmaceutical companies to charge just about any price they want for their drugs. Now Italy has taken a pioneering step in requiring more transparency from the industry.
Currently pharmaceutical corporations are not required to disclose their research and development (R&D) costs, how much public money they receive to help develop medicines, or what prices they charge in different countries.
This means they can — and do — charge sky-high prices and make huge private profits off the back of public investments. The pharmaceutical industry justifies high drug prices by claiming the need to recoup the high costs they invest in R&D. However, they never publicly reveal those figures, preferring to keep us all in the dark about the actual costs involved. Consequently, countries and health systems have to negotiate ‘blind’ with companies while trying to secure an affordable price for medicines to treat their populations.
The last few years have seen escalating drug prices create increasingly global barriers for access to medicines — these price barriers are not limited anymore to people living in developing countries. Cancer drugs, hepatitis C drugs, insulin — sky-high prices for all of the above have created real life and death challenges for people and health systems in rich countries, too. Health systems are buckling under the prices of new medicines everywhere. The public is not getting its money’s worth and pharma has been getting rich at our expense as taxpayers.
Which is why — after some pretty drawn-out and contentious negotiations — there was a cause for celebration at the World Health Assembly back in 2019, when Member States finally adopted a resolution to demand more transparency from pharma over how they price their drugs.
Italy was at the forefront of that initiative in 2019 and today is taking a further important step forward to redress the power imbalance between pharma companies and the public, and require more transparency from an industry that deliberately cloaks itself in secrecy.
August saw the formal approval of a decree from Italy’s regulatory medicines agency (AIFA) that asks pharmaceutical corporations, before any major drugs purchase, to provide the agency with specific information about the company’s R&D costs, as well as the commercial conditions under which the same product is sold in other countries — i.e. the prices the company is charging elsewhere.
The ‘Pricing and Reimbursement’ decree promises to disrupt a system which has allowed for far too long pharmaceutical corporations to impose exorbitant prices on governments for their innovative products, which are more often than not disconnected from actual R&D costs and funded with taxpayers’ money.
Let’s take a closer look at the decree — it requires corporations;
→to demonstrate the ‘added therapeutic value’ of each drug under negotiation — meaning corporations that want to bring a medicine onto the Italian market at higher prices than those of existing treatments, will now have to demonstrate that the new medicine also has increased therapeutic efficacy.
→ to disclose the price at which the drug is sold in other countries — until now, the information about prices in other countries has been ‘protected’ by confidentiality clauses.
→to make public disclosure of the subsidies and public funds received by the corporation towards the R&D costs, as well as disclosure of the overall R&D costs.
→to reveal the status of patents that it holds on the drug.
→and — the icing on the cake — to provide the regulatory authority with annual data on profits and sales of each drug.
“A spectacular ‘win’ for public health”
It’s a spectacular ‘win’ for public health and will undoubtably strengthen the negotiating position of AIFA with pharmaceutical corporations. However, we now need to see the principles on paper turned in to reality.
The task now for AIFA is to define clear means and guidelines for the implementation of the decree. For example, what steps are taken if the corporation does not produce the required documents? Will negotiations be blocked? If this applies for an essential and innovative drug, what consequences could it have on public health? Will AIFA keep its nerve and block negotiations on an essential and innovative drug, given the potential public health consequences of keeping it off the market? And who will verify the reliability of the documents produced by the corporations?
Who will follow in Italy’s footsteps?
There’s a road ahead to travel of course, but the publication of this decree is indeed a pioneering first step. And where Italy has acted, civil society groups elsewhere are now looking on closely, hoping this might encourage other governments to follow suit.
And in a time of COVID-19, there’s no more critical moment to ensure transparency of the costs of drug and vaccine development. Billions of dollars of public investment have already been poured into the race for new vaccines and treatment. We need corporations to come clean on prices and costs, and as well to share clinical data so that fair prices can be set that ensure affordability for everyone — both people in our own projects and others too in need — and that pharma doesn’t use the pandemic as another opportunity to line its pockets. Transparency matters.

Ciao, Italy.
You have started to hold a very special place in my juvenile heart. If there is anything I have ever dreamt of, it is you, Italy. The skies painted in the hues of the Adriatic Sea, the clouds like scoops of vanilla gelato, colorful rumbling vespas like rolling syllables of Italian, men kissed by Michelangelo, women blessed by the Tuscan sun.
I have been fascinated by many places, whom you might know too- UK with its historical charm, France with its elegance and German with its discipline; but there is something unique and different about you, Italy. You can be mandolin in a lively Tarantella on a summer night and the bagpipe in the quiet streets of Rome; and piano is the Ponte Vecchio of these instruments, entwined.
People fall in love with other people in France but I have fallen for you, Italy. It is as if you’ve been sculpted in a way by the divine not to be admired, but to be felt. You have been created for me to awaken long-lost butterflies, the softest goosebumps I thought I’d forgotten. If there is anything I’ve longed for, it has to be you, Italy. I dream to wake up and see your face, feel the morning summer breeze kiss my skin, spending lazy middays penning love letters to you, and dancing in the red-wined soaked air with beautiful souls you’ve wrought.
You fill in the hollow voids of nothingness with ecstasy and a hope, a hope that one day I’ll come to you. I hope to live the sunny daydreams in Tuscany, I hope to eat the best gelatos of my life, I hope to fall for a mark of your splendor, I hope to see Piazzale Michelangelo’s night sky with you, I hope to hear the Basilica’s bells as I pray, I hope to touch the sacred walls as if it’s the divine itself, I hope to smell the different pastas before devouring them, I hope to feel the hurt when I pinch myself, hoping this isn’t a dream.
You aren’t just a place, you’re a promise, a dream, a goal, the perfect end to a happy ending, my happy ending. I promise you that one day, I’ll be coming to you, falling in love more and in your arms. I promise to cry my heart out when I finally meet you, I promise to rediscover the purpose of living there, I promise to unravel all the things you’ve got to say to me, you mysterious gem, I promise to spend my life’s best days there, I promise to never wake up from this dream, I promise to never give up on you, my Italy.   Oh, my unlived déjà vu, I’ll be on my way to you.  One day.   Con amore, Pavitra

Everyone has “a thing” that they do upon their return home from a vacation. Usually, this involves an immense amount of laundry and getting caught up on unread emails.
I similarly follow this trend, except this time. I just returned from Italy, and as soon as I got home, I threw away all of our boxed pasta, canned pasta sauces, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO).
Why?
Because I can clearly taste a difference between prepackaged pasta made with preservatives that I cannot pronounce. I also know that many Italian-sounding olive oils are misleading and not really from Italy at all. The ones I had stocked in my pantry were the kind that I got suckered into buying because it was on BOGO, and I will compare the consistency to motor oil now that I have had the real thing.
During my 10 days touring Italy, I tasted risottos, homemade bread, visited olive farms, gorged myself on homemade pasta, and I even had a four-course meal prepared by the well-known chef Maurizio Staiano of Salerno who has also worked with several Michelin Star Chefs.

I am a Finnish software developer who recently moved to Frascati, Italy. This is the fourth episode in a series of posts where I write about my experiences in living in my new home country.
The observations are written by someone who has lived most of his life in the Northern Europe: first around 30 years in Finland and then some years in the Netherlands.
At the time of writing I’ve been living in Italy for 11 months. It’s time to look back, and see how it has been so far.
I’m working from home in a fully remote setup. My team mates are in the Netherlands, and my client project has people working all over Europe and some outside the continent. I try to go see my team mates and my friends in the Netherlands on a regular basis. Typically this has been about once every two-three months, which is a good cadence for me.
I don’t mind the remote work. During the covid-pandemic I got used to it. But I do notice that it would be nice to have the flexibility to go to the office more often and to see my colleagues and team mates face-to-face without too much preparation. I see them on calls every day obviously, but it’s not the same thing. During the calls or pair-programming sessions the communication is very much focused on work. You lose all the casual interactions and conversations around a coffee machine, which has an impact on the relationships, the feeling of empathy and closeness. Then again, none of this is coming to me as a surprise. I was expecting that working remotely would have this kind of an effect.
However, I did not expect that time has become a really valuable and scarce resource to me. I need to plan carefully where and how I want to invest my time in. Because I’m working remotely and I don’t have the normal community of colleagues around me, my social life has taken a big hit. After all, for an expat the office is an easy place to meet people and to make friends with a similar mindset. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a Finn so I enjoy spending time on my own in silence and isolation, and I don’t need too many people around me. But even a Finn sometimes needs someone else to share the silence with. And it’s healthy if that other person is not always the same as your partner.
So I need to find new friends. But that takes time, commitment and requires extra effort. And time away from Italy, like if I’m going to the Netherlands or Finland for example, is time away from making new connections in Italy. So it’s a difficult balancing act. And especially weekends are extremely precious. You need to make them count.
When I was living in the Netherlands, I had two countries that required my presence: Finland and the Netherlands. Now there are three. And I love visiting each of them and spending time with the people that are important to me. But travelling takes precious time and it’s not only that. It’s also time away from the place that is your home, your safe place with all your things, routines, gadgets, and your own bed. And being away from home too much and too often can be really tiring. Maybe I’m getting old, but I like my routines and my safe place.
I’ve been studying Italian for a few years. After moving here there has been a huge leap of progress in learning the language. I’m able to follow conversations and understand pretty much everything, given that the people do not speak in a dialect, which makes understanding sometimes very difficult in the area around Rome. I once went to have a haircut in Frascati and the guys were speaking in such a heavy dialect that I understood nothing about what they were saying. It adds another layer of difficulty.
Also, I can follow TV series with Italian subtitles without any issues. Noticing these kinds of small things gives me motivation. Speaking, on the other hand, is still difficult, and I know that the problem is mostly in my head. I should just start speaking more but there is some kind of a mental block. It does get easier with time.
Anyway, I like the fact that in Italy you need to know the language in order to survive. The level of English (or even Finnish) isn’t high so you have no other choice. And learning the language is a key factor in integrating with the local culture and society. In general, the Italians appreciate the effort that I’m making in speaking the language. It can be really awkward and exhausting, but at the same time it’s a great learning experience.
And the people are genuinely helpful and warm. They might stop you in the street, have a quick chat, and tell you how nice you look. Or they might ask what you have been eating to be so tall. It’s a bit of a culture shock for a cold Finn from the far north but I like it.
I came to Italy expecting to find good weather, amazing food and wine, and beautiful landscapes filled with endless stories in history. I know that these are probably the most stereotypical things anyone would list about Italy. My apologies, it’s my lack of imagination. But that’s what I was looking for, and I’m happy to say that for the most part my expectations were met.
The weather has been very good. During the winter the coldest period lasted about three weeks. In Finland we would describe the winter in Lazio as “long October”. We barely had to turn on the heating in our apartment. Despite some anomalies in April and May, the sun has been shining and the temperatures have been steadily rising. In fact, at the time of writing there is a heat wave in Italy with temperatures climbing above 40 degrees. Frascati typically has a few degrees less than Rome, and the town is located on a hill so there is a bit more ventilation here. And luckily, our apartment is equipped with air-conditioning. Otherwise, this poor northern boy would be already cooked.
The food and the wine… Well, let’s say the Italians know what they are doing. The food is amazing and the wine is delicious and in abundance. Eating out in a restaurant is affordable. During the week I try to limit myself from eating out, but on a weekend I allow myself to relax and eat all the carbonara available. They recently opened a summer street market next to our apartment, and they have a stand selling panini con la porchetta. It’s cheap, good, and it’s dangerously close.
I am a bit surprised about the prices in the supermarket though. It’s quite expensive, and I don’t notice a big difference compared to the prices in the Netherlands or Finland for example. But the quality of the products is really high.
I’m very satisfied with the amount of nature, the beautiful landscapes, and the hiking possibilities available in Lazio. I love the fact that I can easily go hiking on a lake or on top of a mountain, and just casually pass an ancient Roman amphitheatre or an aqueduct. Il Parco Regionale dei Castelli Romani next to Frascati has enough trails to keep you busy for a long time. I’ve been also joining some guided hikes, and I’ve found that it’s a good way to explore new places and to meet new people in my new home country.
Life is a balance of pros and cons, and life in Italy is no exception. I can make exaggerated jokes about the problems I’ve had, but in all honesty I haven’t had any major issues.
When moving here I was expecting the bureaucracy to cause me terrible headaches. And yes, there have been some challenges, but mostly things have been resolved and there haven’t been any blocking obstacles. You need a bit of perseverance, a healthy level of pessimism, luck, and good connections. I guess having an Italian partner is also a gateway to success (in life in general). My tessera sanitaria is still lost in a limbo but at least I have a carta di identità. And I haven’t filed my taxes yet for last year. I expect this to be another fun adventure.
If you’ve read my previous posts, you already know that I was a bit shocked about the traffic in Rome. Now I’m already somewhat used to it, but I still try to avoid driving a car in the city center. If you’re in need of excitement and adrenaline, there are better ways to get them.
But I’m happy to say that my plan of acquiring a scooter worked wonderfully! Well, not wonderfully. I placed the order in December but finally got the scooter in May after some major delivery issues. However, since then it has been the solution to all of my problems! I’m fully autonomous. I can get to Rome easily, and without wasting time in looking for a parking spot. Driving a scooter in Rome is more fun and way less stressful than driving a car. Plus passing the beautifully lighted Colosseum in the evening with a scooter is pretty damn nice.
Moving to a new country is not easy. And moving to a new country, which is culturally and climatically very different from what you’ve used to, is even harder. You’re pulled out of your comfort zone and placed in an environment where everything is new. And it’s even warm. You need to set up all of your routines from the ground up. It is overwhelming and exhausting.
Personally, I learnt that you need to be patient, give yourself time, and celebrate every small achievement. You start from the basics, small things, and then gradually increase the difficulty level. After each achievement you can reward yourself with a glass of wine. For me this meant going through the following list in increasing level of difficulty:
Working through tasks in this manner creates a positive feedback loop, makes you more comfortable in using the language, and slowly builds up your confidence. You get an idea how things work and you are able to build a routine for yourself.
After 11 months of living here I have my routine pretty much set up. Italy feels like a home.
Really the only bigger struggle I have is finding my group of people to spend time with. It’s a solvable problem but might take some time. And what is life without a bit of challenge after all. Like my friend in Finland says “Ei tänne helppoo oo tultu hakeen” which roughly translates to “We‘re not here because it’s easy”.
I’ve been attending some expat events and I’ve found them a good place to make connections. There is a risk in ending up in an expat bubble, but right now I feel that I’d like to meet people who are in a similar situation and who can relate to how it is living in a foreign country.
Obviously, I continue learning Italian, but it might take a lifetime until I can speak fluently and express myself in the same manner as I’m currently able to do in Finnish or in English. But I like the language and I appreciate the challenge.
I’m actually really happy for the life and the quality of life that I have. I would say that the pros outweigh the cons easily. I guess I might be still in the honeymoon period of living in another country but I might as well enjoy it to the fullest.

As an Italian immigrant who has lived in an at first family-imposed and now self-imposed exile for over eighty percent of his life, I have gotten used to experiencing Italy as a tourist. On many occasions, I have found myself on holiday enjoying la dolce vita and yearning for more of Italy in my life only to then be reminded that il bel paese is much more bello to visit than to live in.
There are many stark reminders that the Italy we visit — even as Italians — is not the Italy that Italians reside in. There are the luxury five-star spa retreats on Capri and Ischia and there are the violent neighborhoods a short ferry ride away in Secondigliano. There are the Belmond collection hotels in the middle of the picturesque Colli Sennesi and then there are the small decadent towns where other Tuscans live. To experience this contrast, one just needs to veer slightly off the beaten path.
In April, I accompanied my mother from our family home in San Gimignano to visit a bookstore in Colle Val D’Elsa. The so-called…

For people living in Italy on a residenza elettiva (elective residence) visa, the cost to opt in to the national health service has more than doubled. A new law was enacted at the end of 2023 that established a minimum cost of €2,000 and a maximum of €2,700 for each person. Prior to this, costs varied wildly region to region, but in general it was about €2,200 for both my wife and I per year based on a formula applied to gross income.
After a lot of back and forth, we got the final calculation confirmed and the combined cost for both my wife and I will now be €4,000 for a year, which translates to about $180 per month for each of us.
The diagnostic and preventive exams provided by Medicare B in the U.S. appear to be better in most respects compared to what we will get in Italy. I guess the health care here is adequate, but it certainly isn’t a screaming bargain with top notch service. As an overview of the basic coverage, the Italian national health service pays for hospital stays, ambulance service, and visits to the emergency room. About once a year the doctor prescribes extensive routine blood and urine panels and the lab work is fast. This costs…

Figuring out the right visa to move to Italy can be overwhelming if you’re doing it alone, and if you make the wrong call, you could end up losing money and staying stuck in your home country.
That’s what’s happening to some people who are being told to apply for the Elective Residency visa. If an immigration attorney is encouraging you to apply for this visa and you’re not yet retired, read on.
The Elective Residency visa is a long-term visa for people who do not intend to work once they arrive in Italy. Typically these individuals are retired or generate passive income from sources like capital gains, dividends, retirement pensions, royalties, or rental property.
While this is ideal for someone who is retired, there are immigration attorneys who are encouraging people who still work (perhaps freelance) to apply for this visa…and they’re being denied.
Some of these attorneys ignore clients when they tell them that they will continue to work once they live in Italy. They focus on the bare requirement (€31k a year in passive income sources) and don’t address what will happen once the individual arrives in Italy and is…

“Yes, I think I have found the house!” I announced enthusiastically to my children and partner. None of us could have predicted how that casual idea of finding a second home would unfold and transform our lives.
At the time, I was at a crossroads. After selling my house, I couldn’t see a clear way forward in my home country. The housing market had become wildly expensive, and renting was nearly impossible without a steady employment contract. Investing in a property felt practical, so I decided to look for a second home — a place to wait out the unpredictable market. My three children were fully aware of my plans and shared in the excitement. After all, the idea of a holiday house in Spain or Italy sounded idyllic to everyone.
The house I found fit comfortably within the “second home” budget. It wasn’t a larger investment that nudged me toward a permanent move — it simply felt right. Honestly, I had never considered leaving the Netherlands before. Even moving to Peru, where my partner lives, had never seriously crossed my mind. But something shifted for me during the COVID-19 years; the Netherlands no longer felt the same.
Most people who move abroad have a clear reason: to study, pursue a job, start a dream business like a B&B, or retire in a new place. None of those reasons applied to me. I just felt an inner “yes” — a pull to go and experience something new.
Of course, I discussed it with my children, who were 19, 20, and 23 years old at the time. The two youngest had just returned from five-month solo trips to Asia, and my eldest had been living in the UK for five years. Their adventures abroad had made them supportive and enthusiastic about my move. But agreeing with the idea and facing the reality of their mother emigrating are two very different things.
Although my decision was guided by intuition, there was also a practical push. In the Netherlands, it’s not possible to live without a registered address. Spending between €1,500 and €2,500 a month on rent felt unsustainable, and moving in with my mother wasn’t a viable long-term solution. After six months of using her address as a temporary registration, I needed something permanent. The house in Italy became that solution. Once I made the decision, the next steps fell into place: moving my belongings out of storage, closing my business and tax number, and eventually selling my beloved old Volvo. (One Europe doesn’t feel very united when you’re faced with the bureaucracy of importing a car or changing a driver’s license!)
Even our dog, Sarah, became part of the plans. My ex-husband and I shared her care, as neither of us could manage full-time responsibility. Sarah traveled with me back and forth between countries. Although the 13-hour drive wasn’t her favorite, she loved her new life in Italy. Tragically, she passed away three months ago and now rests beneath the cherry tree in the garden. I still feel her presence watching over me and the house.
When my partner visited Italy to see the house, he wasn’t thrilled at first. Trading his favorite city, Amsterdam, for life in the middle of nowhere was not what he had envisioned. However, after a rocky start, he’s grown to love it. Working on the land, enjoying aperitivi at the local bar, meeting new friends, and exploring new places have gradually won him over.
And my children? It’s been a significant change for them. Although they were already living independently, my move nudged them further into self-reliance. There’s no longer a “home” to return to for a casual evening or a mother nearby when they’re feeling unwell. Visits are planned now. Yet, they love visiting Italy, and I treasure seeing them every six to eight weeks. They often bring friends, and we make the most of our time together, relaxing and appreciating the simple joys.
The dynamic of family life raises an interesting question: Where should we draw the line between living for others and choosing a path for ourselves? Was it selfish of me to move? Perhaps. But I believe it was a healthy kind of selfishness. In modern society, we often place enormous expectations on each other for care and support, yet these aren’t always balanced or reciprocated. For years, I shaped my life around my children, blending work and caregiving seamlessly. Now, it feels like the right time to embrace a new phase.
And what about caring for our parents? Do we adjust our lives for them, or do they move in with us? In an ideal world, family-based communities would allow for a natural exchange of care — elders helping with the little ones, and younger generations supporting the elderly when the time comes. But in today’s Western society, that’s not always our reality. We’re often left juggling guilt and judgment when making choices for ourselves.
In my book The Ripple Effect: Know How Powerful You Are, I explore how our struggles to grow into emotionally responsible, independent adults can create friction in families. These dynamics are complex and deeply personal. I don’t claim to have the perfect answer, but I’ve made peace with my decisions. Whether I stayed in the Netherlands or moved to Italy, there would have been positive and negative consequences for everyone involved.
I’m incredibly proud of how my children have embraced my choices, and I’m grateful for the new experiences we share here in Italy. Right now, I’m preparing the house for a lively New Year’s gathering with my two youngest and their friends. The house will be full, and I couldn’t be happier.
Follow this blog for weekly updates, surprises, and stories as I navigate the joys and challenges of building a family home and business sanctuary in Italy. There’s so much more to come!

It all started with a conversation in a café. It’s the end of October, and with no previous plans, a friend and I were just sitting idly, enjoying a good pastry croissant and catching up.
“How’s life?”, she asks.
“Repetitive and dull.”, is my honest answer.
“Mine too”, she agrees.
I don’t know if this is common knowledge to most people, but I notice that my generation, what the Internet calls Millenials, is depressed with the state of affairs in the world, and the same goes for the even younger generations.
“We should have way more experiences in life before it all ends. I have health problems now, don’t have a fulfilling career, the world is at war; let’s do what we want”, I say because it’s how I truly feel.
“We should travel.”, and my friend immediately pulled out her phone and started searching cities in Europe from the most expensive to the cheapest. “Oslo — too expensive; Stockholm — too expensive; Dublin — a bit expensive at the time; Barcelona or Madrid — expensive at the time; Rome — the same story. What about Bologne?”
“Why Bologne?”, I asked.

So far, I’ve been to 43 major cities, 28 states, 9 countries, and I have no intention of stopping any time soon. Until the Grim Reaper pays me a visit, I’m going to travel as far as I can while I can.
Even if Mr. Reaper knocks at my door, I may tell him to “Piss off and come back later. My next trip is booked.” 🖕 #redheadattitude
I’ve had great memories at most of my destinations, but which one was the best?
Hands down, the Amalfi Coast.
Located on the western shores of Italy, this was a mother-daughter trip scheduled in 2020 and then canceled due to COVID concerns. That same year, my father passed away, my gallbladder ruptured, and my husband had a heart attack. Needless to say, 2020 was not my best year.

A few weeks back we asked our followers on Twitter what they think are some of the most loved destinations in Italy. The response was quite incredible.
“This will probably be the easiest question I get to answer all day,” writes one of our followers after telling us that his favorite destination is Capri, in the Campania region.
Others mentioned their heritage and origins: “Costa Smeralda, Sardegna,” writes Jonathan, mentioning that his mother is from Santa Teresa di Gallura.
And others admitted “it’s too hard to choose,” as writes Darlene, whose favorite destinations are Pienza in Tuscany, and Capri and Positano in Campania. “So tough to choose,” says Ishita, mentioning Montestigliano in Tuscany.
Kevin didn’t write anything, but responded with a beautiful photo of Florence.
Here are some additional destinations that our Twitter followers highlighted, from small towns to large areas who every year attract tourists from the US and around the world: Amalfi Coast, Budelli Island, Crotone, Guardia Snaframondi (Benevento), Lucca, Monte Argentario, Napoli, Porto Santo Stefano, Salento, Sicily, Taormina.
In March, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) said that overall, the total contribution of the travel and tourism industries to the Italian economy was €223.2 billion in 2017, once all the direct, indirect and induced benefits were taken into account. The report mentioned that, not only Italy is the 6th largest travel economy in the world, but the industry supported 3.4 million jobs in 2017 with an estimate of 4 million jobs by 2028.
So, what is your favorite destination in Italy?

When I embarked on my Italian wine journey nearly three years ago, I could have never imagined having to face a worldwide health crisis here in Italy, or anywhere, for that matter.
Rather than recount grave tales of the current quarantine situation, I wanted to share what I’ve only now realized my fellow Italian citizens have taught me.
It’s been said a million times before, but now, more than ever, we need to remember that we cannot predict or control every aspect of our lives. As an American, this is something I’ve found very hard to accept. Living amongst a population of people who contrastingly seem to embrace unpredictability, has shed a spotlight on my inability to do so.
From my first days working on a beautiful vineyard in central Italy, I wanted to know exactly what I’d be doing when. I’d inquire about lunchtime, dinner time, and my future tasks for the upcoming week, often met by quizzical and unspecific replies. “We’ll pause for lunch when we’re done with these rows”, pointing to an undefined plot of vines, or “when we pick enough Trebbiano for today,” the winemaker would tell me.
Gone were the days of living confined to my office calendar, handcuffed to the rigid meetings, scheduled a month or more in advance. Countless more examples in the Italian countryside, as well as in my current city of Bologna, reinforce that Italians innately embrace the present, instead of wasting time obsessing about the future.
This take-things-as-they-come mindset has proven very beneficial in combating hysteria and fear during these now uncertain times of Coronavirus. Italy and the majority of its people are not overly panicking about tomorrow or being frightened by media reports from abroad.
Despite exaggerated accounts, Italians are not hoarding groceries and fighting in stores, as I’ve witnessed with every prediction of 6 inches of snow in the U.S. They focus their energy on dealing with the day at hand, taking time to prepare for the next, but never forgetting to find a few minutes to laugh and be grateful to be alive.
Unless of course, we’re talking about a football (soccer) match, Italians have shown me that life is much more than a series of back-to-back competitions. In America, we are groomed for competition from birth — just look at the insanity surrounding pre-school admissions. Parents in many parts of the US are forced to apply for pre-school the moment their child is born, in fear of being left out in the cold once their child approaches school-age — 3 years later.
From elementary school through high school, the competition only increases with each passing year. Immense pressure is put on students to outperform one another, gain entry to the highest classes, most prestigious clubs, teams, and of course colleges. Pre-SATs, SATs, state proficiency exams, and class-rankings pit every student against each other, creating tremendous anxiety and comparisons amongst impressionable teenagers.
In the US, very rarely are students encouraged, or afforded the time, to help one another succeed. Instead, they are told to focus on grades, activities, transcripts and overall peer-group standing. Fierce competition for the few coveted spots at elite and popular universities drives an inordinate amount of stress and do-whatever-it-takes approach. Parents and students resort to insane, sometimes illegal, measures to gain advantages and excel above the next student. Only now, are people finally being held accountable for admissions cheating scandals.
This cut-throat competition and dog-eat-dog mentality does not permeate society in Italy or most parts of Western Europe. Many factors contribute to this of course, but one major reason is that most European universities are public and accessible to all citizens, for free, or very little money. It’s been truly eye-opening to see how much this one difference can affect a nation’s culture and mindset of its society.
In Italy, children and teenagers can grow up without the looming fear of college admissions hanging above their heads. I’d argue, this results in Italians being less individualistic and hostile towards one another, from an early age. Family values are emphasized instead of GPAs, and more time is spent cultivating relationships and passing on priceless traditions. Additionally, students generally dedicate more time to their passions, communities, and appreciation of the arts.
Consequently, many Italian adults have numerous “job titles”, such as a lawyer by day, cheesemaker by night. It’s also common for people to work across various industries, instead of being pigeonholed into one. The freedom that comes with guaranteed higher education creates more opportunities to become successful in a field of your choosing, rather than a field that can most-efficiently pay off $100k+ student debt — as is often the case in America.
While competition is, of course, healthy, especially in business, I think we Americans often forget that life itself is not a competition. We must strive for meaningful lives — not only aim for high test scores, job-titles, and bank accounts, simply to out-shine the next person.
Italy’s economy is far from perfect, however, living in this country during good times, and recent times of difficulty has proven to me that quality of life defines a country much more than its GDP. Italians have come together to face this crisis as a unified and optimistic society, something I’m very proud to be a part of, now, more than ever.
#Andràtuttobene — Everything will be alright.

February 13, 2013.
We finally felt ready to start our Europe tourist circuits since our kids have grown enough to be able to sustain the walking around and making use of the full days you spend on this wonderful vacationing continent. Italy and Switzerland combination is what we picked — one country full of history, culture, art and character while the other is one of the most endowed places by nature gods. They are next to each other in Europe so no long intra-continent travel was involved. After much research we decided to drive around Italy and use the train system in Switzerland. I thought that was a great choice and would highly recommend doing that.
We have been doing a whole lot of trips in Asia and in the Americas and so making reservations and planning this trip to Europe was a new experience. Help of experienced friends, internet booking sites and plenty of travel tips from people on Trip advisor was a big help. Things like booking entry into the St Mark’s Basilica beforehand, the use of skip the line tour booking for Vatican, staying in Lauterbrunnen instead of Interlaken, car seat requirements in Europe, making sure about Air conditioning & parking spaces in hotels, keeping passports & cash safe, and second class Swiss pass is good enough (no need for first class) were some very useful tips. Our experience with Emirates for Flights, and Booking.com for booking hotels was very good. For planning our itinerary we used a combination of Frommer’s and Trip advisor write-ups. I also downloaded Rick Martin’s audio guides for Rome, Vatican and Venice — this helped me plan our days better.
Emirates flies 3 times a day from Hyderabad and connects very well to all locations in Europe. So we took nice and comfortable Emirates flights and landed in Rome on July 13th. The immigration process was the quickest I have seen — literally open the passport on visa page and stamp it. The Baggage area seemed old & run down as compared to all the new Indian airports and we had a broken wheel for our duffle bag — not the greatest start. But the airport pick up service we had booked from our hotel Fiume was good and the lady driver was friendly, took us through the Ancient Rome scenic drive — and we had our first breath taking view of the Colosseum — it was late evening so it was lighted up and looked majestic.
Although it was about 10pm by the time we were checked in and settled in the room, we wanted to just get started. So took a map and asked for basic directions from the hotel desk and walked through beutiful Rome streets to Spanish Steps. So one tip is to stay in the city boundary in Rome and second it is incredibly safe & the city is alive till quite late in the night, 1am or so. We clicked a few snaps and then took a rickshaw ride to Trevi Fountain, where we had our first pizza / pasta dinner. The fountain itself was a beautiful site in the night and we just sat on the steps with lot of people around till quite late.
July 14th we had a 10:30 am booking with “What A Life Tours” company for the guided tour of Vatican and Sistine Chapel. We used a taxi to make sure we reach on time and I was a little worked up about the dress code for the Vatican — but it seems people take it casually and you just need to tie a stole or something around bare shoulders for the Sistine Chapel. One thing though, Vatican is just too crowded and it was really hot on the outside at this time of the year — I would suggest winter time as a better time to visit Rome overall. Vatican is so full of the art treasures of the world, and it is so interesting to hear about how each Pope had a different approach to leaving their mark on the Vatican. Picture clicking were not allowed in Sistine Chapel but Michelangelo’s work is amazing with the imagination, the painting itself, the fact that this was done standing with utmost care using plaster art in 1508–12, simply awesome. And then St. Peter’s Basilica reminded of so many movies shot in this area both inside and the square outside — the shape of the church as a Cross, the holy Door, Michelangelo as an architect showing up strongly in the Dome and in his work Pieta (Mary with Jesus on her lap) were moving sites for me. The older walls, the air ducts, and the tombs underneath the basilica are a must see. Our guide Ana was great, energetic and interesting, in fact we paid extra to continue with her for the tour of the St. Peter’s Basilica. We had some really nice fresh pizza lunch sitting on a mat on the steps of the shop just outside Vatican and took a bus for Trastevere.
Trastevere is the areas south of the Vatican and means “beyond the Tiber” river. This is one of the most charming area of Rome with narrow medieval lanes, restaurants and just beautiful to walk around. Lot of picture perfect corners and buildings. We just strolled around the area and thoroughly enjoyed the leisurely time. We took a bus back to the hotel from across the river. But we were still not done — I read on the internet that night time Colosseum is beautiful so we took a bus to the ancient marvel of a building. It was nice, few pictures and sitting in the cool breeze for some time was good. This was a tough day for the kids because of all the walking in Vatican but they held well to my surprise, we did use stroller for the younger one.
Ancient Rome was the plan for the next day. We had breakfast at the hotel and reached Colosseum early at its opening time. The queues were already building up. One of the tips we had was to go the Forums first and buy the ticket there as it is the same ticket that is used for Colosseum. But we did not do it as I really wanted to get inside Colosseum early while it was not hot and spend time there — I will admit that I was mesmerized by this structure and that is why you can notice that I have already mentioned this building several times in this post. What we did was we took one audio / video guide for me, this was a separate line with almost zero waiting time to get in for this — this is probably the perfect way to beat the queue. I am a history enthusiast and to feel what it would have been inside this building 2000 years ago was breathtaking. In fact my wife and my elder daughter also enjoyed the structure as much as I did. For me, it was one of the high points of our trip and we did click a whole lot of pictures. From here, we went to the Forum’s where I used Rick Martin’s walking tour. It was really hot at this time and very tiring for the kids — so we rushed it a bit and focused only on some of the high point’s like the Arch of Constantine outside the forums, house of Vestal Virgins, Arch of Septimius Severus, place of Caesar’s murder. The view from the street of the Markets to Trajan was really nice. This part of Rome warranties a multi-day visit for a history student and perhaps in a cooler weather.
After lunch we walked to the Pantheon, another massive architectural marvel. From there onto the Piazza Navona. This is a beautiful square with lots of artists displaying their work, we bought some really nice paintings here and had one of the several rounds of gelato while in Italy. Rest a while in many of the beautiful squares, get water from the fountains, and walk the streets was the order of the day. We walked right up to Spanish mountains passing through the street with all the well-known big brand showrooms. We spent the evening at Villa Borghese park, a nice break from all the city walking for kids to have some fun. We rented a self-driven rickshaw type thing, rode a Segway for the first time, and dipped our feet in cool fountain water.
Next day started our road trip around Italy. We picked up our pre-booked car from Hertz on the train station. It took us almost 3 hours to pick up the car (frustrating), the GPS we took did not work, and consequently we got lost in Rome for couple of hours. Finally for rest of the trip the age old method of asking when lost and having printed directions is what we did to find our way around. We drove first to Sienna, and stayed in a beautiful chalet. The place we stayed in itself was a 2 floor room with a kitchenette, with olive garden setting and a small pool overlooking the hills. The COOP grocery store was nearby, so we went shopping there and that night cooked sumptuous rajma chawal with cherries to top it all. A nice glass of Chianti wine with the meal was a big plus. The town itself was a really beautiful little place with narrow walkways with incredible medieval buildings. The long combination escalator to go from the foot hills to the town was an experience in itself. The weather was a welcome cool one and we stayed till quite late in the town. The Piazza del Campo, site for annual horse racing event was impressive with lots of people just sitting and lying down in the square on its slating floors.
Our plan to drive through the Chianti area was another high point of the trip. We small winding roads, beautiful hills, occasional medieval time buildings atop the hills, farms around us were breathtaking. We stopped over in a village, Chianti village Castillina, which looked like right out of a movie set. We reached Pisa by the afternoon and here we stayed in a hotel right in the center of the town next to the leaning tower. So we got to spend our entire stay looking and walking around the famous monument. Overall, I thought Pisa was disappointing. The tower itself is not really impressive and the town itself is nothing to write home about. One could easily pass it without missing a bit of the Italy experience. We had decided to skip Florence this time because of kids. We saved it for our second Italy trip :-), maybe without the kids that time.
Drive to Venice was uneventful and efficient as i was quite use tod riving in Italy by now. Here there was another smart thing I learned from trip advisor write ups — we stayed in Mestre — better hotels, enough parking and literally 10 mins from Venice across the ocean bridge. I would say that is the smartest thing to do if you are driving and/ or are with kids and need more spacious room. Venice is romantic, enchanting and it did not feel like leaving the city even after just roaming around for 6–7 hours. The best things to do are to take the Grand Canal ride in vaporetto (water taxi) and then just get lost in the streets of Venice. The mask shops, the small bakeries, the gelato shops were all quite an experience. We had also happen to attend a fund raising music concert in one of the squares which was nice. The gondola ride is ridiculously expensive and a waste of time & money. The main tourist spot St. Mark’s square and Basilica are nice but very crowded until 5pm when the cruise ships leave. For the basilica, it is best to pre-book the entry time online. We were also told that the food here is bad and expensive, but we felt that if you do not want to get very fancy then it is not that bad. Overall, nothing compares to the unique experience of this city.
Onto to Switzerland. We were to spend 9 days in Switzerland and the plan was to start from Geneva with stays in Montreux, Interlaken and Lucerne; and fly out of Zurich. I did not get any good advice on how to get from Venice to Geneva / Montreux. The flights were expensive and not used normally, the direct train is no longer available and wastes a lot of time. I decided to drive the good 600 Kms and drop the car off at Geneva airport. I had lots of apprehensions about this long drive but it turned out to be a great decision. The Italy highway part was fast and then the drive through France, through Mt. Blanc area, was a beautiful drive. We dropped off the car at Geneva airport and took the train around Geneva Lake to Montreux. Before you start using the Swiss pass it needs to be validated at the station but after that it works like a charm. The SBB train system is great.
Montreux is a small city on the other side of Lake Geneva. The lake side walk, small sections for kids to play in the lake itself and view of the mountains is breathtaking. We had our taste of some decent middle eastern food also here. We slept early and next day morning on July 20th we had reservations for a whole day excursion on “Chocolate Train” from Golden Pass train system. I had done these booking on internet beforehand itself but the ticket seemed to be easily available. This tour had mixed reviews but we decided to do for kids, they can have fun as this included visits to a cheese factory and a chocolate factory. I would say that if you are spending enough time in Switzerland then it is not bad at all as one gets to experience internal Switzerland at leisure without too much planning. Kids were excited about the 2 factory visits with unlimited chocolate eating, and the village Gruyeres was postcard beautiful. One can smell the cows and the valley views were amazing. Evening we spent more time at the lake and got ready to leave early morning.
Montreux — Interlaken — Lucerne part is narrow gauge and serviced by golden pass trains. The Swiss pass works just fine, if you want you could do online reservations for extra money but we did not need it. Two tips — find out the time for the Panorama trains as they have the large glass windows for better views; and second not reserving is better as you can sit anywhere without looking for your reserved seats throughout the train. The train ride to Interlaken OST was beautiful and from there we took connecting 20 mins train to Lauterbrunnen. Here although the hotel was just a 3 mins walking distance, one thing we found out was that the shops closes down by 6ish, secondly we reached by 2 but our hotel reception was closed till 4 — now it may just be our hotel but this was indeed odd. Also, the hotel owner was a unco-operative guy and picked fights with lot of guests. Swiss hotels are expensive, with small rooms and limited service in general. We did find a restaurant next to our hotel though which served some great vegetarian food — homemade kind of burger, nice pizza and even had some Indian curry dishes. The information center was very very useful, answered all our questions, helped us plan our outings, gave us good weather information to decide where to go on which days.
Lauterbrunnen was like a “seven star hill station” in my wife’s words. Small village with one main street with all the hotels, view of the snowcapped Jungfrau ranges, waterfalls around the village were all beautiful site. It was a pleasantly cold here after the rather hot Italy weather. We hiked up one of the hills for a view from behind the waterfalls. It was raining for most of the evening and probably snowing up in the mountains. So we planned for Jungfrau the next day, as weather would be clearer and we might see some fresh snow. Now this one was another amazing experience — the train system itself is amazing going up such a height, the way the crowd is handled is efficient and the Jungfrau station set up is nicely organized. As expected there was nice fresh snow and kids had a blast playing in the snow — making snow man, and doing the tubing & sledging for more than 3 hours. We over packed our coats, it was not that cold — what is really needed is the right shoes, gloves, sunscreen of course sun glasses. The ice cave was nicely done too.
We spent 2 more days here in Lauterbrunnen and thoroughly enjoyed them with a great Alps experience. One day we took a cruise in Lake Thun, roamed around in Thun and Interlaken. Interlaken and in several places in Switzerland one can also do para gliding, we decided to skip it though. We were dying for Indian food and so this was the day we had a great meal at Taj Mahal restaurant in Interlaken. In Thun, we also discovered that McDonalds in Switzerland serves the Veggie burger similar to India — kids just loved that and that was our savior for kids over next few days in Switzerland. Second day we went to Mt. Murren and then to Grendelwald where we took the long cable car to First. Here the facilities for skiers in winters, and hikers in summers is great, we enjoyed some hiking, thoroughly soaked into the breath taking views of the valley and then kids had a great time in a play area at this high altitude. Another note on food — as our hotel did not serve breakfast — we used COOPS a lot. We bought nice bread, olives, dips, fruits & vegetables and made sandwiches which the kids loved. All of us were kind of getting bored of the regular breakfast items in restaurants so this was good change.
July 25th we reached Lucerne, which turned out to be a surprisingly large city. We stayed right at the edge of the “old city”. Walking around in this area was very enjoyable with lot of window and actual shopping. We visited the Natural History museum which was OK and the spent time around the canal which had beautiful flower arrangements on the 2 wooden bridges. It turned out that this was also the time for the annual “Blue Bells” music festival. The late evenings when the shops were closed the festival was at its full bloom with number of temporary street shops around the lake, live performances and just so many people having fun. There were very few kids as lot of smoking and drinking was going on. There were food stalls from every part of the world — people were just having a very good time. For our second day we took the train to Engelberg and went up the famous Mt Titlis. We wanted to make sure we did not miss it as this is part of the itinerary for all tours from India, though knowledgeable folks had told us that it would be same as Jungfrau. It was same — but only not as good. The glacier seems to be receding fast, the snow itself was not as pure and soft, the ice cave was a disappointment — but it did not stop the kids from having fun on the snow sledges and had couple of hours of good time. Engelberg on the foothills is a nice quite town and we spent some leisure time along the stream which seemed like a natural flow of water. On 27th, we took our direct train to Zurich airport and flew back to Hyderabad, completing a long awaited and incredibly enjoyable trip.
But before I finish I want to talk about a lot of interesting and delightful findings for us. No one told us about them, neither were they mentioned on the travel sites or books. For one, the ever running water fountains which had perfectly drinkable water was amazing. At first when we saw people filling their water bottles from the fountain at Spanish Steps in Rome we were surprised, and so we asked around and asked at our hotel, as well as the guide at the Vatican Museums to be doubly sure. After that we used it to the full — cool, clean water and free :-). Another very nice concept we saw especially in Switzerland was a COOP store outside of all the railway stations, easy to find and best place to get stuff for a quick snack or making your own sandwich or getting some nice fresh fruits to carry around for kids. Everyone must use them whenever they travel to this part of the world.
The way Swiss pass with a free family card worked for us was also beyond my expectations. Firstly the train network & punctuality in Switzerland is amazing and one needs to experience it to believe it. Lot of people told us about it but still i was positively surprised. Then the coverage on the pass with museums, buses, cruises, discounts on excursions — it was completely worth every penny.
I really should also mention the highways system between cities in Italy. It was again in some ways probably even better than what I saw in US. The “Autostrade” and the state highway network, Strade Statal, abbreviated SS, was great where one could drive at 130Km/h safely and without hassles. Trucks and slow moving vehicles stick to the right lane and if you do not then the guy wanting to overtake you would be touching you bumper at the back literally at that high speed :-), fairly effective system huh. What is more, never did I find a cop lurking around to catch you for smallest of violations. Italians are truly kings on the road :-).
And then the unique architectures. Italy had these medieval time cobble streets with vertical 3 or 4 floor or so buildings right next to each other in almost every city. The doors to these buildings would be massive wooden ones with big bolts and operated using electronic systems. We kept peeping into them and guessed about the insides of these buildings until finally we stayed in one such building in Pisa — our hotel was really an apartment in a building like this. Switzerland on the other had had these beautiful 2 floor buildings with hut shape tops. The Windows almost always had a false door of wood on the outside (or so it seemed), with a simple grill and flower arrangements on the ledge. It looked really pretty.
Now for the things that did not go so well. Firstly, the rental car process, things are really not as smooth or transparent as one would find in the US. It was not clear that if I picked up the car in Rome and dropped in Geneva, there would be about Euro 370 extra charges — that is quite a bit of money and I found out only after the charges showed up on my credit card. And then this was my first time driving in Europe and I was relying on my GPS to work, it just did not and it seems it is a routine issue as no one at the rental car company was surprised when I reported that. Also, they could not fix the problem when i visited the agency again. Then there was the issue of drive from Venice to Geneva I had to cross country borders twice, to pass through France, and that meant I had to pay the Euro 40 charges twice. It really should have something like a one day validity.
We are all vegetarians and were told horror stories of lack of food options for us. But we do love Italian food, Pizza and Pasta, so I was fairly confident that we would be fine. We carried some Indian spiced up snacks so we could take care of once in a while cravings and also carried few boxes of Cup-O-Noodles for kids just in case they did not get adjusted to the food types. But things worked out fine. There were enough vegetarian options on the typical roadside European restaurants and also Gelato was a of course a big hit. Towards the end of the trip we did start missing the Indian spices so we looked up Taj Mahal Restaurant in Interlaken as I already mentioned, and it was great. And once again doing groceries in COOP and then making our own Sandwiches was an option we used more than once, and loved it.
I would say a truly memorable vacation. Europe is beautiful, clean and very touristy as well as provides options to find your own style of spending your precious vacation time.

I hope this update finds you well.
I’ve been back from Italy for about six weeks and am still in the process of digesting all my learning from my trip. It was a fantastic experience, and I’m glad to have had my first international experience.
I will continue to update this article with photos from different days of the trip as time goes on. Nevertheless, I wanted to publish this partially completed version so as to ensure it doesn’t end up in my drafts, never to be shared with the world.
Enjoy this post,
Josh

THE TRAVEL PLANS
The plan was to visit Italy for just over three weeks, with a few days at Rome prior to joining a Tour of Italy for two weeks, with a return to Rome for an extra six or so days at the end of the tour.
We completed the Italy’s best tour with Cosmos. The tour in our trip saw us complete the following:

Places visited:

TAKING A TRAVEL JOURNAL
I decided to take a travel journal to reflect both on my learning, and also to collect receipts, business cards, postcards, holy cards and other trinkets as I toured the country. All in all, I ended up with so much stuff I had to pack all the material collected separately, but there was a lot of value in journalling.
The travel journal I used was made by Typo and can be purchased here:
http://cottonon.com/US/p/typo/the-wanderer-travel-journal/2013463501982.html#start=1
Whilst I didn’t use all of the sections on this tour, I did make use of the following sections:
What follows is my notes from the notes, daily adventures, things I learnt along the way, and second notes sections. I have interspersed photos, post-travel commentary and other relevant pieces of information to make these more useful for future reference.

NOTES:
******
29/06/16
We’re leaving tomorrow morning. I’m starting to pack and get things ready now, following my usual, last minute routine.
I’m looking forward to heading off, and am glad to finally be on holidays from work.
Requests to complete for people while I’m away:
Post-travel note: I made a video for each of these requests on my iPhone and sent them to the people concerned before I returned home.

01/07/16
My first ever view of an international country (Hong Kong) from a plane.
We’ve survived our trip from Australia to Hong Kong. Shortly we will be boarding our second flight, which will take us to Rome.
I’ve followed Courtney’s advice and kept awake thus far. If I can push myself a few hours more and then sleep on the plane I should be close to achieving Rome’s time with my body clock.
I purchased a 500 ml Coke whilst here, which cost 28 Hong Kong dollars. There was a girl here who unrolled her yoga mat and proceeded to do a lot of poses… I was amazed by her flexibility. I have contacted Vanessa.
Whilst on the plane I watched:
I had chicken and rice and nearly choked on an asparagus-like vegetable. I also had pork noodles, which were nice.
Praise God for this wonderful opportunity.
******
01/07/16
I’m on the plane and we are a few hours from landing in Rome. Sleep has been nearly impossible on this plane, so I’m going to be suffering from jet lag when we arrive.
So far the food on this flight hasn’t been as good as the prior one. Nevertheless, things are more exciting now.
I watched the movie for ‘the Entourage’ on this flight, read some more of ‘The Imitation of Christ’, completed this journal entry and tried to sleep, albeit unsuccessfully.
At Rome:
We went to our accommodation and checked in our bags, as we can’t access our room until 2:00pm. From there, we checked out the Pantheon, the St. Ignatius Church (photos of the roof below), some other churches and Trevi Fountain.
We had lunch @ Vacanza Romana. First impression of Italian Pizzas is that D.O.C. in Australia is very authentic.
Also, my rosary broke but I seem to have been able to fix it.
We went for a walk again later in the day. Whilst doing this, we stumbled upon a Mass, where I went up for a blessing from the priest. Prior to that, we had Galati from a place at Trevi Fountain, which was amazing.
We also checked out some Roman ruins at the end of our hotel’s street earlier in the day.

DAILY ADVENTURES
The weather was: Sunny
Day / date: 01/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Land, check-in, get food and rest, and see some sites.
My daily adventures: See earlier notes for info on today.
We also picked up some water from a Marian fountain; I’ve consumed most of it though.
I’m also impressed with the number of drinking fountains in Rome that are free to use, and the quality of the water that comes from these. Apparently there are 1300+ in Rome, which is really impressive.
My desire to learn Latin has substantially increased.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 02/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Revisit some Churches, visit the Colosseum, Colosseum night tour, and take photos, Trastavere, look for gifts.
My daily adventures: We went to the Roman Forum, which was spectacular! We stumbled upon an ancient Marian Church that is on display there until September. We got a lot of photos, so that was exceptionally well timed.
The Colosseum was fascinating, and it was incredible to tick it off the bucket list. The night tour of it was even more exceptional. Pizza from the corner shop was okay but not the best. Really cheap though. At the Colosseum, we met an Australian woman who said she thought that the Italians lived in a museum. I thought she was pretty accurate with that comment.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 03/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia and Vatican City
Plans for the Day: Attend Mass, visit the Vatican, Check out of hotel, join and commence our two-week tour.
My daily adventures: Went to Vatican, St Peter’s Square. Bought 300 Euro odd-dollars’ worth of Rosaries, etc. which we had blessed in the Papal blessing. Moved to the new hotel. It has a bigger room but has a less comfortable bed. We met our Tour Director (Lambros in Gk. or Alex in Italian) then Mum and I went and had chips and lasagne (which was beautiful) at a local Italian restaurant that her and Courtney had eaten at year’s prior.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 04/07/16
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Sistine Chapel, St Peter’s Basilica, Roman Forum, Colosseum, Dinner.
My daily adventures: This was our first day with the tour.
Sistine Chapel — amazing! We will definitely need to revisit this & St. Peter’s basilica to spend more time taking it in. The tour guide was great, but I felt we didn’t get as much time in the Colosseum and Forum as was necessary. I was very grateful we had visited them previously. Dinner was good, consisting of bruschetta, pasta with peas, lasagne, chicken and potatoes, then gelato and coffee.
I’m not sure how these places are able to make a profit, so I assume it is through bulk cooking that they are able to do so. Dinner was accompanied by a flute player and a guitarist, which was nice.
P.s. Today we also met our bus drive Pino.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / day: Tuesday 05/07/16
Destination: Roma, Pisa, Montecatini — Italia
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
On our way from Rome I felt really sick from the bus motion. Consequently I loaded up on my travel tables. As of lunchtime (now), I’m in a medically induced tiredness. We then went to Pisa and saw the leaning tower. Lunch was pizza and biscotti from some street shops. We opted to check out the Cathedral, Baptistery and the cemetery rather than climb the tower. I tried European Maccas there. We had dinner @ Montecatini at a local winery / olive oil farm. The food and wine were delicious and we had great company.
******
The weather was: Sunny with clouds
Day / date: 06/07/2016 — Wednesday
Destination: Florence, Italia
Plans for the day: visit Florence
My daily adventures:
We went to Florence today and got to do a tour with a local guide. From there we went to a local market sitting on a bridge. There is lots of jewellery and leather in Florence, but it is expensive. The highlight of the day for me was paying 15 Euro to go to the Cathedral, baptistery and Museum. We saw some relics, etc. Back at Montecatini, we went to the Funicular and then had dinner at the hotel. I then had a few drinks at the bar.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 07/07/16
Destination: La spezia, cinque terre, Levanto, Genoa, Italia
Plans for the day: Have pesto, check out local village markets, possibly visit the beach, go somewhere nice for dinner
My daily adventures: Today we went to la spezia to catch a train to the cinque terre. Whilst there we visited Vernazza and Monterosso. At Vernazza I looked at the Church, went up to the tower and walked around. At Monterosso we walked around the old section, had pesto @ Ristorante ‘Da Ely” and I ought a beach towel for 10 Euro. We then caught a train to Levanto, where our bus took us to our accommodation in Genoa, a nice, four star hotel. We then went to dinner at a place recommended by our tour Director Lambros, but I didn’t think it was that great.
******
The weather was: Sunny with clouds, cloudy
Day / date: 08/07/2016
Destination: Genoa, Milan, Lake Maggiore, Italia
Plans for the day: as above, with tour dinner
My daily adventures: We had a tour of Genoa with a local guide. They were very knowledgeable, but I didn’t find Genoa as impressive as some of the other locations we have visited. From there, we drove to Milan. I checked out the Cathedral, had Maccas for lunch, bought some Galati and visited the local shops. We then went to Lake Maggiore. We’re staying in a nice hotel here, although we had to get the bed adjusted from a double to a twin share. We had dinner on a nearby island as part of the tour, sitting with two Australia couples.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 09/07/2016
Destination: Lugano, Switzerland
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: We took the bus from Lake Maggiore to Lugano, crossing the boarder into Switzerland. From there, we went to Monte Tamaro, where we had some lunch and got to see an amazing view. To do this, we had to catch a chair lift up and back. After this, we came back to the hotel.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 10/11/2016
Destination: Verona and Venice, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: we left our hotel and went to Verona, where we had a tour of the place and got to touch the boob of the statue of Juliet. We had lunch there and I had really nice pasta. From there, we drove to our hotel near Venice. At night, we went to dinner in Venice and had a quick look around. The food wasn’t too great (in my humble opinion) but Venice was beautiful.
******
The weather was: sunny with clouds
Day / date: 11/07/2016
Destination: Venice, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
We went to Venice via boat again. After finding some people in our group that got separated from the group, we did a gondola ride, which was stunning. After that, we went and got a replacement earring for Julie, before getting lunch. I had pasta and a 500ml bottle of Chianti to myself, which left me a little drunk for the afternoon. We didn’t get to see inside St. Mark’s Basilica, but we were able to see other churches, including S. Giovanni Basilica. We had some ice cream, looked at shops, went back to the hotel and had dinner with some Spanish and NZ friends.
******
The weather was: Sunny (Assisi) Cloudy (Ravenna)
Day / date: 12/07/2016
Destination: Ravenna and Assisi (Dante’s tomb is in Ravenna)
Plans for the day: Drop off Mirtza’s prayer in Assisi. Visit the Basilica.
My daily adventures: On the way to Ravenna we saw the longest river in Italy (650 km) and the church where the musical scale was invented. At Ravenna, we visited the Arian baptistery and the Church of St. Francis, along with Dante’s sepulchre. On the way to Assisi, we stopped for lunch and had a lasagne. At Assisi, we visited the Basilica, which was amazing! Three churches on top of one another! We bought some things at the gift shop and then headed over to our hotel in Perugia for the evening, where we had dinner.
“This is a beautiful country.” (My reflection in the margin at 3:15pm on bus in rural area on the way to Assisi)
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 13/07/2016 — Wednesday
Destination: Pompeii
Plans for the day: visit Pompeii, survive the long bus ride.
My daily adventures: We left our hotel early this morning to drive to Pompeii, then Sorrento. On the way we watched a movie, ‘My life in ruins’ (a comedy allegedly w/ Tom Hanks as the producer about tours). When we got to Pompeii, I had some Pasta, bought some post cards and a booklet on the place. We then took a tour of part of Pompeii, which is so impressive! We arrived at Sorrento about 5:00pm.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 14/07/2016
Destination: Capri, Italy
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: We went on a ferry to Capri. Unfortunately, I was sick on the way over and on the bus after. This caused me to miss the chair lift. Afterwards, we went to a Museum and had lunch, followed by a walk to some scenic spots and a ride on the funicular. We headed back to the hotel for a nice buffet and went for a walk with some friends through Sorrento, stopping at a wine bar for a drink.
******
The weather was: raining
Day/date: 15/07/2016
Destination: Positano, then Rome
Plans for the day: Visit Positano, get to Rome, wash clothes for tomorrow.
My daily adventures: We caught a bus to Positano, where it was raining. This is the only day so far that it has been raining whilst we have been on tour. We checked out Santa Maria Assunta Esan Vito whilst there. From there, we made our way back to Rome, only stopping briefly at two places to get some food and to have a toilet stop, because traffic jams caused us some delays. The dinner was a bit disappointing, but the company was nice with a brief tour on the bus following at night, along with a stop over at Trevi Fountain.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 16/07/2016
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Move hotels, make our plans for the rest of the week, get a nice lunch / dinner, go site seeing.
My daily adventures: We had breakfast with our kiwi friends prior to moving to our old hotel. 140 Euro a night to sleep on a couch, as Mum had the bed. Anyway, we went and checked out the temples of portuna and Hercules, the mouth of truth and related basilica, another church and basilica, picked up some holy water, crucifix and prayer card, ate pizza and Maccas, washed clothes. I bought a guide to the pantheon (which we revisited) and read it, and also bought a bottle of cheap Chianti for consumption prior to the trip home.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 17/07/2016
Destination: Roma, Italia
Plans for the day: Mass @ Pantheon, visit catacombs
My daily adventures: Today we went to Mass @ the Pantheon. This was cool, as they turned on all the lights and cleared the tourists out for it. There were only 18 or so people 5 minutes beforehand, but it ended up with about 100 or so. From there, we met up with Anita & Ryan after lunch and walked to the catacombs. These were so impressive, and definitely worth the 8 Euro to get in. After this, we bought some pizza and had it on our hotel’s rooftop.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 18/07/2016
Destination:
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures:
We had a much needed and well-deserved sleep in and low start to the day. We then walked to Trastavere, and had a look around (although there was not much to see). Afterward, we walked to Castel Sant Angelo, and paid to walk around inside. It was quire impressive, but left me pondering why Pope Paul III had a room decorated about the pagan god Apollo. After relaxing, we went hunting for an ATM that worked and then had a nice dinner a few blocks behind the Pantheon.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 19/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Shopping for gifts for family, friends and myself
My daily adventures: We spent most of today looking around to buy bits and pieces for family and friends, then we found a really nice place for dinner.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day / date: 20/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day: Visit Michelangelo’s Moses
My daily adventures: I went to Santa Maria Maggiore, Santo Pietro in Vincoli, St John Lateran and the Santa Scala. We had lunch near the Colosseum, which is probably the worst lunch I’ve had during my time here. Consequently, we had sinner @ the same place as the night before. I started coming down sick today.
******
The weather was: sunny
Day/date: 21/07/2016
Destination: Rome
Plans for the day:
My daily adventures: Today I was unwell. Consequently, our original plans to visit St Paulo outside the walls did not occur. We’ve had a pretty laid back day today. I have purchased a backpack to take my trinkets and gifts for people home in.

Revisiting Romans 9
One of the religious topics I have most disputed in the last few years is, ‘Does God love all men?’ Historically, I have said no on the basis of Romans chapter 9.
After hearing a sermon on 1 Timothy 2:4 (God desires all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth), I knew I could not accept an understanding that requires two wills in God or the verse to be interpreted to mean, ‘all elect men’, not ‘all men’.
The only section for which I had not been able to come to a reasonable conclusion about was this section in Romans 9, particularly:
Material consulted during the process included:
I understood the Calvinist position well, but was unable to understand the Catholic position on this scripture. They are not quite Calvinistic, Lutheran or Arminian. Nevertheless, a sermon by Adrian Rogers (not Catholic) helped me along with various writings of Thomas Aquinas (summa theologica and his notes on Romans) to finally see how people with other paradigms hold their position.
This position seems to me to make better sense of the particular text, of the scriptures as a whole, and of the Catholic position. Consequently, this post constitutes a retraction of my former position (unless it can be sufficiently demonstrated otherwise that this position is wrong).
The sermon by Adrian Rogers was as follows:

Italy — what a unique country! The landscapes, the food, and, more than anything else, a whole unique set of unspoken rules that no one ever bothers to explain. But don’t worry, there’s no need to panic!
In this article, I’ll give you five little secrets that I picked up from my time living in Rome. Try to embrace them, and you’ll navigate the Italian way of life without offending an entire nation. So enjoy, soak it in, and before you know it, you’ll live La Dolce Vita like a true local!
Italians don’t drink cappuccino after 11 am. They cringe at every tourist who dares to eat pizza with pineapple on top. Eating fish pasta with Parmigiano is considered a direct attack on every Italian and putting an ice cube into a wine glass is the fastest way to get arrested.
Ever heard of these things? Influencers have taken over the world and so have their over-exaggerated stereotypes of the Italians.
Italians are some of the friendliest and chill people in the world. They won’t make you slurp a carton of milk if you order a ‘Latte’ instead of a ‘Latte Macchiato’ on accident. They won’t take out some sort…

We just came back from an amazing week long trip to Italy with kids. We enjoyed great weather — it was 50–60 degrees in December, great scenery and of course delicious food.
Since I am a massive travel nerd, and we have seven people traveling, I planned everything down to a minute. It took quite a bit of time to prepare for the trip, but it was definitely worth it. Huge thanks to Joanne Wilson who gave me pointers and linked me to her post about trip to Rome.
We booked Airbnb, on via Panisperna, next to Colosseum, found an AWESOME tour guide, reserved restaurants for dinner, and bought the tickets for train and museums in advance.
Arrive Rome 12:35PM, settle in apt by 3PM
Lunch: Antico Bakery, via dei Shiavari 54
Evening: Walk around Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps
Dinner: Re-cafe, Piazza Augusto imperatore, 36
We arrived at noon and boarded a van that was ordered for us by our Airbnb host. The ride was about 30 minutes and cost €80.
We settled in our apartment on via Panisperna, which was right by St. Maria Maggiore, Termini and a Colosseum. The apartment was quirky and fun. Bathroom decorations stood out.
After unpacking we needed to grab food. We headed to the famous Antico bakery for lunch. Unfortunately it was closed due to St Stephane holiday and we went to Alice pizza instead. Alice is a popular chain that makes small, thin, square pizzas of different kinds. It’s actually really good.
After lunch we headed to Trevi Fountain to enjoy, and take pictures. It was very crowded, but kids really liked it. A few blocks from Trevi fountain we found gelato San Crispino, which was on our top 10 gelato places. It was pretty amazing, especially banana, and apple flavors.
We then headed to Spanish Steps. The area was bustling and festive. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the lights. We claimed the steps all the way up and took a bunch of pictures.
After Spanish Steps we went for dinner at Re-caffe. The service was slow and inattentive, but the food was pretty good.
Morning: Colosseum and Ancient Forum
Lunch: Trieste, via Urbana 112
Afternoon: Fountains of Rome tour, Campo Di Fiori
Dinner: Cul De Sac, Piazza di Pasquino 73
We woke up early and headed to a local breakfast place. We stumbled upon La Licata — an awesome place that had variety of croissants and sandwiches including vegan, and glutton free. Coffee was great too. Right after breakfast we took 5 min walk to Colosseum, where we met with Simone our guide.
Simone came highly recommended and didn’t disappoint. For the next 3 days he gave us most insightful, and interesting historical tours we’ve ever had.
Per Simone’s suggestion we bought Colosseum tickets online, and didn’t have to wait. The tour started with Simone talking about the construction, types of stones and techniques that made up Colosseum.
As we made our way up Simone talked about gladiators, their training, lives and strategy they used to survive and thrive on the arena. Simone had encyclopedic knowledge of history, archeology, art, culture and languages and weaved together an amazing narrative.
With Simone’s help we were transported almost two thousand years back and the space came alive with vivid details.
We walked around the Colosseum, and learned about sitting arrangements, daily schedules, the economics of fighting, and even how romans made deals in the public bathrooms.
After Colosseum we headed across the street to ancient forum. Again history unfolded in great details because of Simone’s masterful story teller.
We talked about the origins of Christmas, and multiple meanings of the word messiah — both the god’s messenger and a king. We talked about Christianity and Constantine’s Arc, and how Nero killed himself and Trajan rushed back to claim the emperorship. We talked about Octavian conquering Jerusalem, and the original menorah imprinted on his arc. We talked about skillful manipulation, lies and propaganda that Roman senators, and emperors were so good at.
After the tour ended we visited Trajan’s market and column and headed to Trieste on via Urbana for lunch. Trieste is a relatively new place on a trendy via Urbana. It serves small round pizzas that are incredibly delicious. The owner was super nice, and super personable. He told us, that like true artist, he would never compromise and make pizza with ingredients he didn’t believe in. He said putting pepperoni on a pizza doesn’t make any sense. We agreed.
We sampled simple yet very delicious pizzas with mushrooms, artichokes, vegan without sauce and margarita. We also got a baked eggplant and Parmesan dish hat was very tasty. We finished lunch with Tiramisu, which was, without a doubt, the best one we’ve ever had.
After lunch we decided to go on a self guided tour of fountains of Rome. I saw the tour described on one of the websites and wrote it down. We started with Tritone fountain on Piazza Barberini. It’s a relatively small, but pretty fountain designed by Bernini.
Next we headed to Spanish steps, which were as busy as we found them yesterday, but less pretty because it was still daylight. At the foot of Spanish Steps we looked at another Bernini’s fountain called Ugly boat. We didn’t find it ugly, but we didn’t find it all that interesting either.
Next, according to the tour route, we were suppose to go to Trevi fountain, but since we visited it yesterday, we went straight to Piazza Navona instead.
The Piazza was very pretty with all the holiday lights and stands. We started with smaller fountain. It was really beautiful, and we took a bunch of pictures. We then moved on to Bernini masterpiece the Fountain of Four Rivers. We love the fountain, but even after reading about it and symbology it’s hard to tell which river is which.
We headed to Cul de Sac for dinner, a cozy place that came highly recommended by Joanne. The place didn’t disappoint. We shared a cheese platter, which was delicious. We enjoyed bean soup, spicy chicory. cheese ravioli, seafood black rice risotto and linguine with marinara sauce.
Morning: Skull and Bones Museum, Via Veneto 27
Lunch: Pasta Imperiale, Via dei Coronari 160
Afternoon: Vatican Museums and St Peter
Dinner: Sofia, Via di Capo le Case 51
We started day two with a breakfast at a place on via Urbana that wasn’t really great so I won’t mention it.
Our first stop was the Skull and Bones Museum — a strange place off Piazza Barberini. The entrance cost €8 for adults. We were very intrigued because the museum contained a crypt with art works made out of 4,000 skulls, and bones.
The place was literally amazing and unlike anything else we’ve ever seen. The photos weren’t allowed but I managed to take one anyway and after the guard made me delete it. We used the recover feature to restore it.
The crypt had 7 chapels each with a different arrangement and theme. Each featured different types of bones, and focused on different message about spirituality and death. It was creepy, beautiful and unlike anything else we’ve ever seen.
We bought a couple of magnets and bookmarks and headed to Campo Di Fiori. On the way over we stopped by Trevi fountain, which is always great to look at. Then we stumbled on St Ignazio Basilica and decided to explore it instead of going to Campo Di Fiori.
The basilica is quite large and beautiful. Tall ceiling has frescos in the style of Sistine Chapel with a very well done perspective. We explored chapels, tombs and oculus — all around very cool.
For lunch we headed to Pasta Imperiale on the gorgeous via dei Coronari.
Despite the fancy name this place proved to be a tiny hole in the wall, literally, we barely fit in. The pasta was absolutely delicious and super cheap only €5 each.
You could mix and match pasta and sauce. Gnocchi with pesto was the best. It simply melted in your mouth. Ravioli with spinach and ricotta were on point. We also had spaghetti and tagliatelle with marinara sauce. Pasta were just right and sauce was super fresh with chunks of real tomatoes. Portions weren’t big but the pasta was very filling.
Right after we headed over to Gelateria Del Teatro which was literally 20 steps away. We watched professional cannoli making through the window. Then we walked inside. Everything from gelato to cannoli was perfect.
No wonder this place was rated among top gelato places in Rome — delicious. We enjoyed a bunch of different flavors of gelato and cannoli — everything was absolutely great.
After lunch we headed to Vatican for our tour. A twenty minute walk ended with breathtaking views of casa St. Angelo and St. Peter. Kids were very impressed with the St Peter square, and we took a bunch of pictures.
Simone, our guide, was waiting for us by the entrance. Again, because he told us to buy Vatican museum tickets online we didn’t have to wait and went straight into the museum.
Simone gave us another unforgettable tour full of amazing historical details and insights. We started with Ancient Rome artifacts, and worked our way through tapestry and maps rooms to Sistine Chapel.
We continued the tour inside St Peter Cathedral and enjoyed Le Pieta and several sculptures by Bernini. Again our guide made the tour incredibly informative and engaging.
After the Vatican we took 45 min walk back to get to our dinner place, a restaurant called Sofia.
Great food, a little pricier than other places, but really good food. The place is small and very cozy. We shared mushroom and blue cheese pie, and for appetizer. For the main course we had risotto, bean soup, and cod with side of potatoes — all great. For desert we had chocolate cake and red courant cheesecake, which was amazing.
Morning: Tivoli
Afternoon: St Maria Maggiore
Dinner: La Taverna Dei Fori Imperiali, Via della Madonna dei Monti, 9
Day 4 was our first trip, a guided tour to Tivoli. We met with Simone and the driver at 8:30 near our house. Driver cost us €275 for entire tour. It made sense since there were 7 of us.
On the way over we talked about politics, economics, travel, history of Italy and many other things. Simone has truly encyclopedic knowledge, has taught in University of Rome, and has traveled the world. Every single conversation with him was awesome and exciting.
Tivoli is just a short 30 min ride from Rome. We first went to visit Hadrian’s villa. When Hadrian became an emperor he didn’t get along with the Senate, so he decided to not live on Palatine hill like other emperors, but rather decided to build a villa in Tivoli. To make sure the senators don’t disturb him and don’t try to kill him, Hadrian kept a legion of soldiers near by.
The ruins are rather well preserved and we enjoyed the tour very much. Hadrian designed the villa in a thoughtful and meticulous style. Imagine a modern house but each room amplified to be the size of a half or full football field — a study, gym, the dinning room, bathroom, etc. a study was a sacred place where emperor was meditating for days and couldn’t be disturbed.
Bath was used by the emperor and his servants, soldiers and even slaves. Dinning room was designed to be 3 different dining from rooms so that depending on the time of the day, sun angle and season you can pick the best combination — for example, cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.
Hadrian also was incredibly well traveled and recreated several of his favorite places inside the palace. For example he designed Egyptian style pool with statues running around, and actual crocodiles inside. He surrounded the pool with the dinning area, so his guests could eat in a reclined position and enjoy the view.
In the afternoon we went up to see villa d’Este, which was created by Cardinal Ippolito d’Este. Again, Simone took us on an amazing tour of history and gave us an awesome perspective on the villa. It turns out that the cardinal came from influential and powerful family that had close ties to France.
He was very close to becoming a pope, but German king vetoed his papacy. After a bitter loss the cardinal embarked on the quest to prove that he is a better men by spending over $1MM Scusi (likely close to $100mm in today’s money) over 20 years to build the villa.
It was worth it. The design of the villa is incredible. First, the villa itself featured beautiful rooms with frescos by famous painters. But the best part of the villa are the gardens with 50 fountains and 60 waterfalls, all ingeniously laid out and flawlessly executed.
We got back to Rome in early afternoon, and were in the mood for sweets. We used Foursquare to find that a highly rated Gelateria Fatamorgana was right next to our apartment. We headed there, and discovered tiny place with high quality gelato and no place to seat. Gelato was great, but we also needed coffee.
Next, we stumbled on the whole in the wall butcher shop with most amazing Italian pastry Sfogliatella. The owner of the shop only spoke numbers in English, but I discerned that he said eat it while it is hot. We ate all 3 and then went back got two more. It was just delicious.
After coffee we went up to see St Maria Maggiore, one of the biggest. Churches in Rome. We bought a quick tour to get up on the balcony to enjoy the view, and check out massive mosaic, papal rooms and a Bernini staircase.
We had dinner reservations at La Taverna Dei Fori Imperiali. But unfortunately it was closed and we went across the street to The problem is it was closed so we moved across the street to Angelino “ai fori”. The place was good, but not amazing.
8:00AM Train Rome => Florence
Snack: Antico Vinaio, via dei Neri 65
Morning: Academia, Ufizzi
Lunch: Eataly, Via dei Martelli 22
Afternoon: Duomo, Ponte Vecchio
Dinner: Mercado Centrale
9PM: Train to Rome
This morning we got up and headed to Termini to take 1.5h train to Florence. We bought tickets in advance using Italia rail web site. Ticket prices seem to vary and there are different web sites that sell them. Ours ended up being about €60 per person for the round trip.
Navigating train station is really easy, just look up your train number on a big screen to see the platform. The ride to Florence is quick and pleasant.
Our first stop in Florence was a famous sandwich shop Antico Vinaio. The sandwiches were super delicious — highly recommended.
Next we headed to Uffizi gallery. We bought Uffizi tickets online, but still had to stand in line to get the tickets, and then another line to get into the museum. The highlights are of course two paintings by Botticelli — Birth of Venus and Primavera. We also enjoyed Caravaggio and spent some time looking at pre-renaissance Italian painters.
After two hours kids were tired, and we went to lunch at La Fettuna, instead of walking to Eataly. This is a family style place where we had grilled chicken, gnocchi with tomato pasta, cheese, marinated artichokes, and thick soup made of vegetables and bread. Food was good, not amazing, but waiters were super friendly.
After lunch we went to walk through Ponte Vecchio which was super crowded, but really festive. After that we headed towards another bridge to have gelato at Santa Trinita. It was fabulous, I particularly enjoyed Strawberry sorbet.
Right next to the gelato place here was a shop with art supplies and kids wanted to check it out. They spent a bunch of time looking at different pencils, and markers and ended up buying a few.
We crossed the bridge, and headed back towards Duomo. The streets lid up with amazing lights and great atmosphere. When we got to Duomo the main church was closed, but we got into the baptistery and had a chance to admire it’s fantastic mosaic.
After baptistery kids and I headed to Campanile, and set to climb 414 steps up to the top. After 20 min wait we got in and started the climb. There was two way traffic and really hard to pass people. We kept going up and up and up and finally reached the very top.
It was very windy but the views were worth it. We took a few pictures and then started to go down. It was a little more awkward, but didn’t take long.
After the Campanile we walked around main square with a beautiful tree and then headed to the market.
The market in Florence is two floors and the second floor is entirely occupied by bistros, pizza, pasta and sandwich places. It’s one of the best markets in Europe, if not the best one, that we’ve been too.
The atmosphere was awesome. The food was just gorgeous and you didn’t know what to get. We finally settled on a pizza place, and also had a spinach rice ball, vegan soup and a bunch of cannoli.
After the market we took a short, 7 minute walk to the train and headed back to Rome. We were a bit bummed out that we didn’t get to Academia and Duomo, but overall we spent a great day in Florence.
Morning: Pantheon
Lunch: Obica: Via dei Prefetti, 26a angolo Piazza Firenze
Afternoon: Borghese Gallery
NYE: Circus Maximus
We decided to sleep in and got up around 9:30AM. After breakfast we took a walk to Pantheon. The entrance is free, and Pantheon is awesome. We read up on the history, and walked around.
Next we did a bit of souvenir hunting, and then went to Campo Di Fiori. We ran into a fresh fruit stand and couldn’t resist. The fruits were really delicious.
After the market we headed to our lunch place — Obica — a mozzarella bar. We ordered mozzarella, burrata, ricotta samplers and roasted eggplant and focaccia, several salads, soups and pastas. Everything was incredibly delicious, particularly cheeses and eggplant. This easily made our top 3 places of the trip.
After lunch we took 30 minute walk to up the hill to visit Villa Borgehese. This is one of the top museums in Rome, and we didn’t want to miss it. We bought tickets online ahead of time. You have to arrive at specific time and can only be in the museum for 2 hours.
The highlights of the museum were statues by Bernini including Apollo and Daphne, which is just breathtaking. Museum also features paintings by Caravaggio and Titan. Overall, it is a small museum, but it really packs the punch.
We went back towards our apartment, and decided to have dinner back at Trieste. As the first time pizzas were delicious. We also ordered soup of the day which was awesome. And, of course, we had to get the tiramisu again too.
After dinner we went back to apartment to rest before NYE.
At about 10pm we got back to the streets and headed to Colosseum and Circus Maximus to enjoy the New Year eve show. The streets were fairly crowded. We got to Circus Maximus about 11 pm. It was absolutely packed. It was super loud, and nearly impossible to breath because of smoke.
The show started with acrobats with drums flying over crowds. It was kind of cool and bizarre at the same time.
The crowds kept getting bigger, and it felt like at least several hundred thousand people there.
We waited until the countdown and joined the roar. 5 minutes after New Year we headed out, and walked home. Honestly the show was a little underwhelming but we had a good time anyway, and wer happy to be in Rome for 2017.
Day 7: Rome, New Years Day
We woke up late around 10:30am. Our plan was to go to Jewish Ghetto and Trastevere.
We had breakfast at Annalemma because our usual breakfast place was closed. The service was slow but yogurts with blueberries and omelette a where good. I got food next door at Ce Stamo a Pensa, which is a tiny street food place. Vegetable calzone and fried donut were absolutely delicious.
After breakfast we headed to Bocca dela Verita — a giant ancient face carved into a stone located near entrance to Santa Maria Cosmedin. We spent about 30 mins in line, waiting to stick our hands inside the mouth. The legend has it that of you tell a lie while holding your hand in the mouth, it will be bitten off.
With all our fingers and other body parts in tact we headed off towards Great Synagogue. We bought tickets to Jewish Museum, which also included a tour of synagogue. The museum was compact, but informative. The tour was kind of meh, but the synagogue was impressive.
After the museum we headed to via Portico d’Ottavia to sample local delicacies. The Bosscione bakery was closed, but we got a bunch of very tasty sweets at Cremeria Romana.
We then got fried artichokes at Yesh Sheni, and while looking for a place to eat them stumbled upon Bocca Di Dama. We bought coffee, hot chocolate, a couple of small hazelnut pastries, and one gelato. The gelato was chocolate and orange and the second scope was berries. Super delicious.
We made a two minute walk to see Fontane delle Tartarughe, a small but pretty fountain where dolphins got replaced by turtles. Right next to the fountain there was a cute pepper store.
After we headed to Trastevere, and crossed via Tiber Island — a tiny island with pretty views. We wanted to have dinner at Antico Carolone and stopped by to make a reservation. We got lucky, and got a table for 6:30 pm.
In Trastevere we first headed to St Cecile, a small church tucked in one of the smaller squares. The church had pretty courtyard.
We then went towards Santa Maria in Trastevere — the biggest church of the neighborhood. On the way we walked through more pretty streets. On the plaza before the church a street performer impressed us with her fire skills.
At 7:30 we got back to the restaurant and were immediately seated. The waiters were super warm and attentive. We ordered grilled vegetable antipasto and fried artichokes for appetizer and 3 kinds of pastas. Everything was very homey and very delicious.
In general we were surprised by home many food places where open on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day — a lot more than we would expect. Being in Rome for the holidays is no problem at all food wise, and attractions were open as well. The weather was really great 50 and sometimes close to 60. In the evenings it got, but never really cold.
Next day was our last day and we just did wanted to do the tour of our favorites — La Licata. Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pasta Imperiale, Gelateria Del Teatro, and, of course, Trieste pizza. We did manage to swing by St Peter in Vincoli which has spectacular statue of Moses by Michelangelo.
We had an amazing time in Rome in December and this was an unforgettable trip. Kids are already asking to go back ;)

This morning, I stopped by a coffee bar near my house. I’ve become friends with the barista, Stefano. As Stefano prepared my macchiato lungo, he said he had some sad news. His father, who had been ill for some time, had died. The funeral was canceled because of the restrictions imposed on the region.
Stefano placed my coffee on the counter. Normally, in an Italian coffee shop, you stand at the bar and drink the tiny cup of espresso. I took a few sips as we continued talking. A guy with his phone to his ear, apparently a co-worker, stepped over and rapped sharply on the bar. I’d violated a rule. All customers, per the decree, are to sit at tables. This is part of the mandate that people are to maintain a one-meter distance from each other. Stefano said that if a policeman drove by and saw me drinking coffee at the counter, he could be fined several thousand euros. He also reported that city officials had been driving past with bullhorns, urging everybody to stay inside.
Yesterday, at the local supermarket, a man in a uniform…directed everyone to get a large…

Italy, a country renowned for its rich history, breathtaking landscapes, and delectable cuisine, carries with it several nicknames that reflect its unique identity. These monikers capture the essence of the nation and the various aspects that make it special. In this article, we will explore Italy’s most popular nicknames, their meanings, and what they signify about this beautiful country.
One of Italy’s most famous nicknames is “Bel Paese,” which translates to “Beautiful Country” in English. This nickname encapsulates Italy’s extraordinary natural beauty, encompassing everything from its picturesque countryside, rolling hills, and stunning coastal regions to its historic cities filled with architectural marvels.
The name “Bel Paese” is frequently used in art and literature to describe the aesthetic beauty of Italy. It represents Italy’s legacy of art and culture, where countless artists, musicians, and writers have drawn inspiration. From the scenic landscapes of Tuscany to the grandeur of Venice, it is no surprise that Italy is celebrated for its beauty.
Italy is often colloquially referred to as the “Boot” due to its distinctive shape resembling a high-heeled boot on the map. This playful nickname is used mainly in informal contexts and reflects the country’s geographical layout.
The “Boot” concept adds an element of charm to discussing Italy and is often used to help depict the different regions of the country. For example, the “toe” of the boot refers to Calabria, while the “heel” pertains to Apulia. This geographical representation enables both Italians and visitors to understand the country’s diverse geographical and cultural landscape better.
Another popular nickname that resonates with many people is “La Dolce Vita,” which translates to “The Sweet Life.” This phrase became particularly famous after the release of Federico Fellini’s 1960 film of the same name. The essence of “La Dolce Vita” captures the Italian spirit of enjoying life’s pleasures, from delicious food and wine to beautiful art and architecture.
Italy’s rich culinary tradition, full of regional specialties, delightful desserts, and world-famous wines, epitomizes this philosophy. Italians celebrate family gatherings, socializing over meals, and savoring life’s simple pleasures — an approach to life that many associate with the Italian way of living.
While not a nickname in the traditional sense, it is essential to note that the very name “Italia” carries immense historical significance. The term “Italia” originally referred to a specific region in Southern Italy and has roots dating back to the ancient Greeks. Over the centuries, the name expanded to encompass the entire country after the unification of Italy in the 19th century.
The name is derived from the ancient Italic tribes that settled in the region. Today, “Italia” is a source of pride for Italians and an integral part of the country’s identity. It represents the nation’s long history, rich cultural heritage, and diverse regional influences.
Italy is also often referred to as “The Land of the Popes” due to its historical and religious significance. With over 1,800 years of papal history, Rome is home to the Vatican City — the smallest independent state in the world and the spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church.
This nickname highlights Italy’s important role in the history of Christianity and its influence on global religious practices. Not only does it identify Italy with a significant aspect of its culture, but it also attracts millions of tourists annually who visit the Vatican to see treasures like St. Peter’s Basilica and the Sistine Chapel.
Italy is famously known as “The Cradle of the Renaissance,” a nickname that captures its historical importance as the birthplace of one of the most significant cultural movements in European history. The Renaissance, which occurred from the 14th to the 17th century, marked a period of rejuvenation in art, science, and thought, leading to monumental changes in society.
Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome were pivotal in showcasing revolutionary ideas and artistic achievements. Renowned artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael emerged during this time, and their works continue to be celebrated worldwide. The nickname reminds us of Italy’s enduring legacy as a cultural powerhouse.
Italy is known by several nicknames, including “Bel Paese” (Beautiful Country), “The Boot,” “La Dolce Vita” (The Sweet Life), “The Land of the Popes,” and “The Cradle of the Renaissance.”
Italy is colloquially referred to as the “Boot” because of its distinctive geographical shape that resembles a high-heeled boot on the world map. This nickname is useful for identifying different regions of the country, like referring to the “toe” or “heel.”
“La Dolce Vita” translates to “The Sweet Life,” reflecting the Italian ethos of savoring life’s pleasures, including food, art, and company. It symbolizes the relaxed and joyful approach to life that many associate with Italian culture.
Italy earned this nickname due to its significant role in the Renaissance, a period of cultural rebirth that began in the 14th century. Notable cities like Florence and artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo emerged during this transformative era, leading to lasting contributions in art, philosophy, and science.
The name “Italia” has historical roots, originating from ancient Italic tribes. It has since become a source of national pride and represents the country’s cultural heritage and diversity stemming from thousands of years of history.
Italy’s nicknames encapsulate the nation’s beauty, culture, and historical significance. From “Bel Paese” to “La Dolce Vita,” these monikers highlight the unique aspects of Italian life and the enduring impact that Italy has had on art, cuisine, and religion across the world. The richness of Italy’s nicknames is a testament to its profound influence over the centuries, drawing visitors from all around the globe to experience the magic of this remarkable country.

On March 25, the Heads of State and Government from Union member nations will be gathering at the Capitol in Rome, in the very same hall in which the Union came into being.
The commemoration of this anniversary entails undertaking a reflection on the process of European integration, which is all the more pressing given that, for the first time, a country — the United Kingdom, a member since 1973 — is leaving the Union.
medium.com
A first question is what was the situation in Europe and the circumstances in the world prior to the Treaties: whether they were simpler or more complex than today’s.
To begin with, the founders were driven by strong international instability characterized by a bipolar competition across-the-board.
With the exception of the Soviet Union, Europe emerged from World War II divided and weakened.
The demarcation line between the two superpowers ran right through the heart of the continent, sundering the continent in two for a long period of time.
A few years earlier, the Berlin Blockade and the Korean War had generated a tangible threat of a third world war. In 1955, it was only with great difficulty that the Austrian question was settled by resorting to a neutrality clause. An insurrection broke out in Algeria, after Tunisia and Morocco won their independence in 1956. That same year also saw the invasion of Hungary and the Suez Canal crisis. This marked the end of an era, with Europe’s powers disabused of any residual colonialist delusion.
This precarious set of circumstances meant that Europe was in need of a new outlook.
The Treaty for the Steel and Coal Community was signed in 1951, a year after the project for a European Defence Community, which however was shelved in France.
It was Italy that became the driving force, first through the 1955 Messina Conference, and then in 1956 with the Venice Conference, with Gaetano Martino, Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Segni government, at the lead.
Backed by democratic consensus in their home nations, the fathers of Europe who brought the Treaties into being were not visionaries but men of politics who, well aware of the challenges and risks they were facing, found a way to tackle them.
Men who had the courage to transform the weaknesses, vulnerabilities and anxieties of their respective populations into strengths, pooling together each country’s capabilities in the effort of building an open, overarching society in which liberty, democracy and cohesion would be mutually guaranteed.
The Europe we have come to know in these past few years has proved to be a vital tool for stability, safeguarding peace, economic growth and progress by advancing a rights- and civilization-based social model unequalled up to now.
Europe was gradually built by the joint effort of former enemies of the Second World War and later by the former adversaries in the “Cold War” who until a few years earlier, had belonged to alliances poised to battle for forty years.
If we look back at how far we have come, it is clear that the path has never been easy ever since the beginning.
If we look at the annals, we see that the path to integration has been complicated all along, starting with France’s “empty chair” policy in the mid-1960s.
Next came what German Foreign Affairs Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher would later define as “Eurosclerosis” during the 1970s, courageously overcome at the start of the following decade above all as a result of an Italian and German initiative.
Italian Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo spearheaded this drive, working alongside figures like German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the President of the French Republic, François Mitterrand and even US President Ronald Reagan.
The oil shock, soaring inflation, and mass unemployment were the most pressing problems to be tackled at that time, against an international backdrop marked by particularly strident clashes between the two blocs.
The impetus towards European unity has always been stronger than any entrenchment or overzealous temporary distinction pursued by individual governments or groups of countries, playing a significant role in fostering the evolution of international relations.
Indeed, the common needs underpinning a shared aspiration to ensure stability to the liberty and independence of European nations were pressing, starting with the six founding nations: France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.
Today, Europe seems to have almost turned in on itself. As aware as its leadership is of the steps that need to be taken, it remains hesitant when it comes to getting them underway.
As in the past, there is a need for forward-looking visions and an ability to embark on new and courageous paths.
A few figures illustrate this.
In 2000, the Union and its Member States produced 26.5% of the world’s Gross Domestic Product. By 2015, this percentage had slipped by as much as four points.
Over the last twenty years, the population of the entire European continent — also outside the Union’s borders — has remained more or less stable at around 750/800 million people. At the same time, Africa’s population, which today is around 1 billion, could double in just twenty-five years.
These two figures alone make it clear that Europe as a whole runs the risk of becoming a minor player on the international scenario, while across the world “giant” states continue to grow.
No European nation, on its own, can guarantee the effective independence of its decisions. Considering the dimension and scale of the issues, no return to old forms of national sovereignty can assure peace, security, well-being and prosperity to European citizens because no European nation alone will ever be able to stand on the international stage, expecting to influence events.
It is as true today as it was sixty years ago: we need a united Europe to serve our Continent’s needs for development and prosperity, which are indissolubly bound up with our collective capacity to make our voices heard on the world stage, asserting the values, identities and interests of our people.
In 1957 and even before, when founding fathers Adenauer, De Gasperi, Monnet, Schuman and Spaak conceived the first blueprint for integration, European identity was neither a matter of doubt or debate. There was no need to use abstract metaphors.
The grief, hunger, rubble, disease and existential angst caused by the two world wars — East to West, North to South — brought together millions of Europeans who, ever more insistently, asked their respective ruling classes “Why?”, followed by a resounding cry of “Never again!”.
The consequences of having betrayed the values of European civilization not once but twice over the course of a few years were clear and evident to all.
The founding fathers’ call to rally grew out of the memory that a Europe of openness, solidarity, art and science; a Europe of free thinking, tolerance and integration; and a Europe of trade needed to find its way again and this was something that could only be achieved together, uniting the resources and the future of the Continent’s nations and of its peoples.
The persistence of so many separate, sovereign European states appeared to them to be, in this sense, anachronistic, no less than had been the case in sixteenth-century Italy, when the country’s free communes and small principalities before the encroachment of powers like Spain and France.
Ten years earlier, on 29 July 1947, a few months after he was elected President of the Italian Republic, in this very chamber Luigi Einaudi announced that he would be voting in favour of the Peace Treaty in a speech that I quote to you now:
“In vain did sovereign states erect high customs barriers around themselves to maintain their own economic self-sufficiency. All that these barriers were good for was impoverishing their peoples, stirring them up against one another, prompting them to talk a strange and incomprehensible language about living space and geopolitical necessities, each one of them proclaiming exclusive excommunications against foreign immigrants, as if a population ferociously shrinking in on itself can generate wealth and power rather than misery and discontent.” He went on to add his hopes for a United States of Europe: “It is not a question of preaching. What matters is that the parliaments of the tiny states of which our divided Europe is made up renounce a portion of their sovereignty in favour of a parliament in which they are represented, a chamber elected directly by the peoples of Europe in unity, without distinction between one state and another and proportionate to their number of inhabitants, with individual states represented in the Chamber of States in equal number.”
In other words, what Einaudi was has been telling us for seventy years — and this remains true to this day — is that the true alternative to fragmentation and irrelevancy for each of these States is on the contrary a process of unification based not on the hegemony of the strongest but peaceful advancement through federal and democratic institutions (as also Altiero Spinelli sought), with equal rights and duties for all States, large and small, that freely decided to become members.
Indeed, one year earlier, Winston Churchill had expressed his hope for a structure to rebuild the family of European peoples and make it possible to live in peace, security and liberty: in his words, “a kind of United States of Europe”.
Over its sixty-year history, Europe has succeeded in keeping the key founding promise of its identity.
War has been banished and, for the first time since time immemorable, three successive generations have lived without experiencing such barbarity.
It took others to point this out. In 2012, to the amazement of some, a country that is not part of the Union awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union.
When bitter armed conflict closed in on the Union’s borders in the Balkan Peninsula, despite initial hesitation and indecision, Europe realized the importance of helping its neighbouring peoples to emerge from a crisis that seemed unsolvable.
The Union chose to offer these countries a political haven within the European framework. It is therefore a source of great satisfaction to see that Slovenia and Croatia are part of the Union today and that the other nations are moving along a path of gradual integration that Italy follows attentively, favours and encourages.
Nor should we forget the fact that being part of the Union helped Northern Ireland put an end to a long and bloody trail of violence.
Over the years, the European Union has embraced peoples and countries restored to liberty after a history of dictatorship: Greece, Portugal and Spain found safe anchorage for their futures within the European Community. They were followed by veterans of Soviet influence, nations that after 1989 became part of a Europe that until then had lacked the input of its Central and Eastern peoples and cultures.
The plurality of sensibilities, political positions and national traditions within the Union today have led some to question whether it is wise to move ahead rapidly along the path to enlargement.
And yet not even Europe can afford to postpone its rendezvous with history when it calls; nor may it surrender to separation and — much less — to amputation. On the contrary, we should be practising and enhancing mutual responsibility and solidarity in sharing benefits and burdens.
European identity is constituted by the ensemble of each of our cultural and historical heritages, alongside its heritage of shared principles developed jointly over the last few decades. What we must do now is look ahead and find the right tools to ensure that integration may continue.
These years of peace, well-being and prosperity in Europe have enabled us to achieve goals of which the founding fathers would, despite limitations and shortcomings, quite rightly be proud.
The many benefits for its citizens lie in Europe’s profile.
It is the thousands of domestic customs rules and regulations that have been abolished to enable the circulation of people and goods — something that is of great value to an exporting nation like Italy.
It is the Italian products that are arranged on supermarket shelves across European cities, as more than 60% of Italy’s exports go to Union nations.
It is the one hundred million tourists that every year, without needing a passport, move freely and unhindered across the Schengen Treaty area, many of them in Italy.
It is the millions of young people who study freely in European universities thanks to the Erasmus programme.
It is the common currency which, in a short space of time, has become the world’s second most important reserve currency. As a result of European Central Bank policy, the euro has significantly brought down credit costs, safeguarding the savings of enterprises and households alike.
It is the improved environmental protection standards in our cities. It is the development of renewables and the reduction in harmful gas emissions. It is the thousands of protected areas that safeguard our quality of life.
It is the certified safety of food that protects our health, guaranteed by the traceability of the foods consumed in Europe.
It is the safety of our children’s toys.
It is the thousands of patents awarded European-wide protection.
It is the trade agreements that regulate and guarantee relations with other nations.
It is the greater security offered through the prospect of a common defence policy, recently placed back on the agenda.
It is the internal protection of our social model.
It is the Charter of Nice ensuring the fundamental rights of Union citizens.
Overturning the expression attributed to Massimo d’Azeglio, we might say: “Now that we have made Europeans, it is time to make Europe”.
Indeed it is the people, especially young people, who already live the experience of this Europe, and who are the guarantors of the irreversibility of European integration. The Union must direct its attention and efforts towards them.
The hallmarks of European civilization are our values of individual and collective freedom, tolerance towards others’ choices, and an openness to ways of thinking that come from other contexts, without abdicating compliance with local laws and traditions. Albeit with delays and shortcomings, these values have spread and asserted themselves far beyond Europe’s borders, helping to build an order in which the concepts of solidarity, mutual support among the different levels on which our societies are structured, and harmony between the public and private sectors to reduce major social scourges, are strong and distinctive characteristics of what Europe is.
Solutions to the sovereign debt crisis and the economic slowdown cannot entail a curtailment of social rights within member states. Nor are they an excuse for coarse definitions of Northern and Southern Europe.
This is the soul of our Europe. This is our identity.
If we want a stronger European Union, this is where we must start.
Every time, individually or collectively, that we have forgotten this inspirational thrust, perhaps unconsciously we have helped turn a major political undertaking into a technical and bureaucratic programme with which the citizens of Europe have sometimes found it difficult to identify.
The economic and financial downturn has shaken the social fabric of our nations, while at our gates, wide-ranging instability and epochal historical events — migration for one — have undermined Europe’s capacity to meet the expectations of its citizens.
The challenges to which the European Union must rise, above and beyond financial and migration-related issues, the Union’s Eastern and Mediterranean borders, and terrorist campaigns, once again highlight the need to rise to the challenge of reforming the Treaties. This is unavoidable, as is pointed out in the Report by the Committee of Wise Men presented recently to the President of the Chamber of Deputies.
The ambitions of the Treaty of Lisbon, today in force, appear ill-suited to the nature and breadth of these challenges, and to the pursuit of the goal of achieving ever-closer continental integration.
Building the future requires Italy and Europe to contribute every available resource, an extraordinary unity of intent and a robust faith in the founding values of the process of integration.
What we need is not a non-impossible return to a past that no longer exists nor walls that merely push the problems onto others without resolving them, but solidarity between nations, solidarity across the generations and solidarity among citizens who share the same civilization.
When a newly free and democratic Italy was taking its first steps as a Republic, De Gasperi said, “To stay the course we must draw on the reconstructive and unifying energies of all Europe. All we can do, in order to counter the march of instinctual and irrational forces, is to call on our common civilization: the solidarity of reason and a sense of liberty and justice.”
Now more than ever, we must make these words our own.
*Excerpts from President Mattarella’s speech to the Italian Parliament on March 22, 2017.

The alarm clock goes off at 7:00am. I immediately do my morning stretches before going for my habitual morning run, a few kilometers traversing the narrow, winding streets of Cinque Vie and around the Castello Sforzesco. After, either a bowl of whole-grain cereal mixed with bananas and strawberries and Turkish coffee. If I’m feeling extra Italian, a brioches al pistacchio topped off with a warm cup of cappuccino at the corner café. Then I’m off to work at my office located in the historic 14th century Palazzo Borromeo. Lunches would consist of either a plate of pasta or a protein-based dish, to be had on the fashionable piazza just in front of my office with a view of a 16th century church. In the evening, a drink or two at my favorite lounge at the Darsena neighborhood. Had it been Fashion Week or Design Week, a quick pit-stop at an after party or at a gallery opening before heading home to get a peaceful night’s rest.
This was how some of my days looked like in Milan, the city I called home for nearly a decade. I had moved to this bustling metropolis at the tender age of seventeen to study at university. With dreams as vast as the endless cityscape before me, I embarked on a voyage of self-discovery, leaving behind the familiar comforts of my hometown of Jakarta.
The streets of Milan hummed with the promise of adventure, each corner whispering secrets waiting to be uncovered. Amidst the towering skyscrapers and labyrinthine cobblestone alleyways, I found myself at the cusp of adulthood, navigating the intricate tapestry of urban life with a blend of trepidation and exhilaration. With every step, I wove my own narrative into the fabric of the city, carving out a place for myself amidst the chaos and possibility. And so, the saga of my odyssey began, a tale of resilience, growth, and the boundless potential of a longing to succeed.
This journey had not been without its lows. Finding myself in the midst of an international crowd had made it difficult to learn the local language, especially during my initial years in Milan. It was only when I started to join the workforce that the melody of the language began to spark a note within me. What had initially been thinking twice and endlessly practicing under my breath before going into a café to order an espresso eventually became second nature. Over the years, I had become a fixture at these cafés; the staff need not ask what I would like to order anymore, they simply bring me il solito, the usual. I am, after all, a creature of habit.
I owe much of my relative prowess in the language to my friends and colleagues, who patiently endured my stumbling attempts at conjugations. Their encouragement, coupled with countless laughs at my linguistic missteps, transformed my rudimentary grasp of Italian into something more coherent. Granted, they didn’t teach me to speak Italian; they taught me to speak Milanese, which is what some Italians regard as a refined blend of English and Italian generally spoken by overachieving business people and stylish fashion enthusiasts in the nation’s financial capital.
Covered in an abundance of arts and culture, my life in Milan had been rather colorful. I had the remarkable opportunity to come across people from diverse backgrounds, eat marvelous food, and travel relentlessly. However, it had not always been easy. When the pandemic hit at the onset of this decade, like many other young people starting off in their careers, I had struggled to cope with the stringent restrictions. I was fortunate enough to be living with two extraordinary people who respectively hailed from Spain and Sicily, who undoubtedly made my time in quarantine worthwhile. We would sit for hours over home-made Sicilian cuisine sharing stories about our lives prior to coming to Milan. As the sun-kissed Mediterranean flavors danced in our palates, we all felt extremely connected through the commonalities we had discovered in the stories we shared. Naturally, we all kept in touch after we went our separate ways, the Spaniard to Emilia Romagna and the Sicilian to her native island. She would sometimes send me the quintessential pacco da giù, a package usually sent by madres and nonnas of the South to their children and grandchildren in the North. She would fill these pacchi with paste di mandorla, my favorite Sicilian dessert after cannoli.
Among the bustling piazzas of the city, there lay a treasure trove of museums, each a sanctuary for treasured paintings and sculptures. These cultural havens became my beloved retreats, and further fueled my interest for the arts. I often find myself gazing at Francesco Hayez’s Il bacio, the masterpiece on display towards the end of the Pinacoteca di Brera, for prolonged periods of time. Michelangelo’s statue of David commands attention from its prominent position at the heart of the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence, about a two-hour train ride from Milan. I stood transfixed, drawn into the intricate details of this renowned sculpture. Florence offered more than its artistic treasures; as I wondered through its enchanting streets, I was greeted by breathtaking views of the Arno river and the red-tiled rooftops that stretched out before me. I indulged in copious amounts of Tuscan bread, each bite a revelation. Renowned for its lack of salt, it seemed to sing with the flavors of the region, a perfect complement to the rich olive oil and robust wines.
Having lived in one of the most prominent fashion capitals of the world, it would come to no surprise that I had made a great deal of friends that are somehow intertwined with the realm of haute couture. My interactions with them made me somewhat of an expert on the topic. Although I do struggle differentiating between cerulean and other shades of blue, I have learnt enough to know that my favorite fashion show is Alexander McQueen’s Ready-to-Wear Spring ’98; that Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace had a heated rivalry throughout the late twentieth century; and that Tom Ford had initially worked at Gucci before starting his eponymous brand.
Although Milan was beautiful in its own right during the day, it was the nights where the lion awakens in its den. A cocktail da asporto in hand listening to L’appuntamento by the majestic Ornella Vanoni, whilst casually staring at the latest pieces of high fashion embossed in fluorescent light at Via Montenapoleone. Those were the days.
Nestled in the heart of Lombardy, Milan offered a gateway to mountains, lakes, and beaches. This geographical blessing meant that adventures were never far away. During the sun-soaked summers, my best friend and I would embark on journeys to the charming coastal towns of Liguria in his sky blue vintage sedan listening to Italian hits from the ’80s. The salty breeze mingled with the nostalgia of the music, creating a soundtrack to our youthful escapades. As the seasons shifted and snow dusted the peaks, our attention turned to the Italian Alps. Bundled up in our warmest gear, we’d venture into the snowy expanse, eager to carve fresh tracks on the slopes. The thrill of skiing down those majestic mountains was unmatched, each run a new adventure waiting to be discovered.
Milan, with its strategic location at the heart of three international airports, was more than just a city; it was a launchpad to adventures far beyond its borders. International travel became a routine part of life. Den Haag to attend my sister’s birthday dinner? Easy. Frankfurt for my best friend’s wedding? Just another weekend trip. Athens for a bachelor’s party? Been there, done that. London to visit my uncle? A frequent flyer. From the cobblestone streets of Den Haag to the vibrant markets of Athens, each destination held its own allure and charm. Yet, no matter how far I traveled, Milan remained my anchor, always welcoming me back with open arms. It wasn’t just a city; it was the starting point for countless journeys, each one leaving an indelible mark on my soul. And for that, Milan will always hold a special place in my heart.
Navigating the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy was a trial by fire, one that tested my patience and resolve in ways I never imagined. The infamous Italian red tape was a beast of its own, one that many expats struggled to tame. I was lucky enough to emerge relatively unscathed, but I witnessed the battles of others who weren’t as fortunate. I quickly learned that trying to fight the system was like banging my head against a brick wall — painful and ultimately futile. So, I did what any survivor in Italy does: I adapted. One of my greatest accomplishments was obtaining my driver’s license in Italy. Months of grappling with specific terminology and enduring compulsory driving lessons, all conducted in Italian, were no small feat. If there is one way to master the art of driving, it is by maneuvering through the narrow streets of Milan while receiving colorful scolding in Italian from your instructor as you deftly dodge a Fiat 500 driven by a formidable nonna.
As my time in Milan drew to a close, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness at the thought of leaving behind spontaneous adventures. No more day trips to the serene beauty of Lago di Como or the romantic allure of Verona. But as I packed my bags, I knew that the memories of those carefree days exploring the wonders of Il Bel Paese would stay with me forever.
Italy became not just a destination but a journey of self-discovery, marking the beginning of my solo adventures in a foreign land. It was my first taste of independence, a chapter in my life where I learned to stand on my own two feet. I couldn’t claim to have made it solely on my own. Behind every step I took were the unwavering support and love of my family, friends, and colleagues. Their encouragement and guidance were the pillars that held me up during moments of doubt and uncertainty. Yet, Italy represented more than just a physical location. It was a decade-long odyssey, a tapestry woven with the threads of newfound friendships and unforgettable experiences.
Living away from my family and the friends I grew up with was a challenge, but it was also an opportunity to create a life enriched by the presence of beautiful souls who became like a second family to me. They shared in my triumphs and failures, my joys and sorrows, shaping the person I was becoming. As I reflect on my time in Italy, I realize that it wasn’t just about navigating a new country; it was about navigating the depths of my own soul. And in doing so, I discovered a strength and resilience I never knew I possessed. This country had taught me a great deal of things. But it is now time to say good-bye.
Arrivederci, Italia. Until we meet again.

There is none.
Ok that’s a lie — there’s some. But honestly, coming from a US upbringing it really means none. The study of “personal space” is called Proxemics, ever since 1963 when the cultural anthropologist Edward T. Hall, decided to name it extremely appropriately. Because of his wonderful work, more people have noticed this variation of how close people like to be to other people and studied it. So now we know that in North America, the average “appropriate” distance to be away from another person is literally longer than arms-length away at four feet. Italians, the culture that likes to smoosh their faces together multiple times while greeting, are absolutely fine with two to three feet of distance. I will attest to the fact that city Italians have an even smaller circle that hardly extends past their actual being. If I go into the center, I will absolutely touch other people. This is a given now, and I have accepted it for the most part. Today at the playground in the park, however, I couldn’t get over how these kids throw themselves around and over each other without a care.
The study continued to agree that “In Italy, it’s also common for people to establish extended physical contact when having an exchange. For instance, a person may reach for a friend’s forearm as a way to communicate openness and honesty or walk arm in arm with a coworker (of any gender) as they discuss something confidential.” Even when I was younger, I never minded a pat on the arm and thought it nice, so the casual physical interactions that happen here are endearing, and usually come from the older crowd. Older Italians are absolute suckers for babies and puppies and neither is safe from roaming cuddles and kisses. Maybe that’s why the kids Proxemics numbers are subzero numbers here. I’m pondering all this today as I watch three boys crawl over each other up the slide and then past Giulio as he was trying to go down it. It’s madness.
I grew up as one of maybe ten or so kids in our neighborhood that was surrounded by corn fields and woods. We didn’t have a swing set, but we had acres of land to ourselves. Of course, this mirrors throughout society and culture. In the US,I grew up with houses having backyards, grocery stores had parking lots as big as the piazzas here. Three grocery carts could pass in an aisle at the same time. I could do cartwheels in my bedroom. Here, if I did a cartwheel in any part of my house, I’d definitely be at the hospital. If I don’t have to wait for a traffic jam of carts to clear in the grocery store, it’s a good day. As described, the neighborhood fits about forty-eight (this is like a guess-the-jelly-beans-in-the-jar-number. I honestly have no idea. It’s a lot.) high-strung children from the ages of months to preteens in the size of a baseball diamond with four swings, and three slides. Of course youre going to get used to having less personal space — because there isn’t much to go around.
You know the little dance you do when someone else is in front of the item you need in the store? That awkward back and forth waiting for them to move? Not here. If someone wants something, they’ll get it. Maybe even move you out of the way a bit to do it. This, once accepted, is actually awesome when you can use it yourself.
Sometimes, it’s infuriating — this closeness. Sometimes, it’s pretty endearing. It certainly does bring everyone together — because we have to. Everyone is in everyone’s face always. So we learn to deal with each other — just like Giulio having no issue with being bowled over as he runs to the slide — with a special burst of confetti from the other kids on the way (it’s Carnevale here so paper confetti is a free-for-all and, again, everyone just accepts it). Of course, I still believe everyone needs a bit of personal space — and that that’s the best way to be. That’s why we get away every once in a while and have our garden out back. But as I live here longer, my bubble of personal space has gotten smaller, and I think maybe overall it’s a good thing. It really gets you in touch with the people around you. Ha!

Hey friend, congrats on getting married! The ceremony was absolutely beautiful. The church was so charming — though of course, not as breathtaking as the Sistine Chapel, where I went, by the way, when I studied abroad in Italy. Did I ever tell you about that?
My compliments to your caterers — the dinner was delicious. I loved your cute American lasagna buffet, but it’s just too bad you couldn’t serve authentic osso buco or cacio e pepe, which I ordered (and took pictures of for Insta) all the time when I lived among the locals in Napoli — or Naples, to non-Italians. Delicious cake, too — so adorable that it’s from a local award-winning bakery, which reminds me of this tiny rustic corner pasticceria I visited every day for tiramisu — or tiramisu, to non-Italians.
Speaking of Italy, you should have been there the first time I tried spaghetti al nero di seppia. Well, before the part where I spit it out after learning it was made from squid ink, then asked for chicky parm instead. Actually, most of the time I ate these fantastic simple buttery noodles from a part of the menu called bambinos, which in Italian likely means something like “very autentico adventuroso eaters.”

“Today we celebrate the sustained excellent results of an agreement signed 15 years ago which marked the start of an intense collaboration between Italy and the US in tracking down hundreds of illicitly exported artworks,” said Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities Alberto Bonisoli in his remarks during a ceremony at the Embassy of Italy in Washington DC for the presentation of the catalog Saving Art Preserving Heritage.
“What we are seeing here is a small part of the results of that cooperation, but no less significant in that they exemplify the shared culture that unites Italy and the US,” he added.
Remarks were followed by the Repatriation Ceremony of three artifacts and by an exhibition of 20 works of art recovered in the last two years by the Carabinieri Heritage Protection Unit in collaboration with the FBI and ICE.
The importance of the event, hosted by the Italian Ambassador to the US Armando Varricchio at the presence of Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities Alberto Bonisoli and General Fabrizio Parrulli, head of the Carabinieri Heritage Protection Unit, goes beyond the catalog that was presented and what it represents — the work done by so many to preserve Italian art and antiquities for the benefit of the Republic and the global community.
Indeed, cultural heritage itself is the foundation to our global society. We see cultural heritage — art, monuments, archives — as something greater than ourselves; a reflection of our past collective identities and a legacy we wish to see survive for future generations. This survival is especially important given the vital role of heritage in crafting memories and preserving histories.
“The pillage, looting, destruction, illicit trafficking of cultural heritage, be it Roman coins, ancient illuminated pages or precious and unique works like the mosaic floor on display tonight, is a wound in the flesh of humankind,” said Ambassador Varricchio in his welcoming remarks. “Like all wounds, it will not heal, without leaving a scar. A scar in our ability to understand past civilizations and past cultures, a dent in our capacity to shed light on the incredible human journey that defines who we are today. By losing the past, we blur our present and obfuscate our future.”
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Italy, a country with a rich past, has put the preservation of cultural heritage at the top of its agenda both domestically and internationally.
The issue is crucial also for the US, which was represented by the top cultural and enforcement officials of the Administration, including U.S. Department of State Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs Marie Royce, US Department of Homeland Security Deputy Executive Associate Director Alysa Erichs, and FBI Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division Robert Johnson.
The volume presented during the event marks over 15 years of cooperation between Italy and the US to protect and preserve Italian art, antiquities, and cultural objects, made possible by a bilateral cultural property agreement that outlined steps both countries can take to combat the trafficking in Italian cultural objects. The catalog collects more than 200 recovered artifacts.
The successes we have achieved are predicated not just on the determination of the Italian Government but also on the effective cooperation we have with our partners and friends across the globe and in particular the United States.
Artistic heritage is not just a system of “artifacts” which preserves the vestiges of styles, eras, and images of bygone human history. It is also the eternally present metaphor of a past that returns in its “distance closeness” and in the enduring oxymoron of a historical becoming that, by travelling backwards, projects itself into the present and future.
For example, a painting from the 14th or 17th century opens a window on the past, but the image we see beyond the shutter is very real to our eyes. Art comes to life when we look at it and takes us back to the very same lines that the artist drew centuries before. The same is true of archaeological artifacts.
Our century finds a market for everything, and where there’s money, there’s crime. Thus the commingling in this sector of organized crime, professional thieves, adventurers, merchants, and unscrupulous gallery managers, auction houses and museums is increasingly common. Behind the criminality of this trafficking is the real loss to humanity.
The ultimate result is the irretrievable loss of historical information.
The challenge to combat art trafficking globally, and especially in Italy, is even more pressing when juxtaposed with the Republic’s peerless cultural heritage. There are more UNESCO World Heritage Sites (54 in total) in Italy than in any other nation.
Italy and the United States have met this challenge through our agreement, which uses both legal and social measures to discourage looting and increase legal access to Italian cultural heritage.
The agreement is re-evaluated every five years in order to adapt to a constantly changing world with increasingly “expert” traffickers and shifting priorities.

“Ciao, un caffè, per favore.” That’s how every morning started during my last holiday in Italy. Typically, these mornings I spent in small cafés, filled with the buzz of loud voices and the clink of espresso cups. These cafés made you feel at home with warm sunlight streaming through the glass windows and the fine aroma of coffee delicately wrapping around you. Among tanned locals, you order a tiny espresso cup with a glass of water, just like a typical Italian. Hot, bitter coffee runs through your veins, you place the cup back on the bar counter, put on your sunglasses, and then disappear into the narrow streets…
How did I get there? After an amazing lunch with pizza, my friend and I decided to spend a couple of weeks in Italy, visiting the most iconic cities and eating authentic Italian pizza, something we had always dreamt of doing. After researching, we chose four destinations: Florence, Rome, the Cinque Terre National Park, and Genoa. We booked Airbnb flats, packed small suitcases, and embarked on our greatest adventure to the land of sun, pizza, coffee, and delicious gelato.
An unusually bright and hot sun greeted us when we arrived in Florence. Though we were exhausted from the journey, we decided to take a short walk to the city center. We were staying quite close, on the opposite bank of the Arno river. The weather was perfect for a summer evening: warm, but with a light breeze.
Our first stop was Florence’s famous cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. The construction of this magnificent Renaissance dome began at the end of the 13th century. The vast Gothic structure is striking, with its front decoration showcasing an incredible mix of pink, white, and green marble. Due to circumstances, we couldn’t go inside, so we peered into the marvelous interior through the open door.
Next, we visited the less famous but charming church, Santa Croce. I have a special connection with this place. As a child, I visited Florence with my mum. Once, in a funny and somewhat scary moment, we nearly got lost and missed our group. We had to rush across the Santa Croce Square to meet our guide. It was our first trip abroad, and we were a little scared of getting lost in a city we’d never been to before. Fourteen years later, as an adult, I stood in front of that beautiful church, smiling at my childhood memories. I was surprised at how different things looked after so many years. The square in front of the church wasn’t as huge as I remembered it being as a child.
Then we went to the Roman crossing, the Ponte Vecchio, or Old Bridge. Since the 13th century, there have been shops lining the road across the bridge. In the evening, it becomes full of street musicians and couples. Ponte Vecchio is a very romantic spot in Florence, with its great views over the river and of the bridge itself. We arrived just as the sun was setting, and its pink and brown shops started to gleam gold, reflecting in the calm water. On the other side of the river, there were tiny identical cottages with pollards. Followed by the deep red-purple sunset, we sat down on the dry, rough grass and cooled ourselves with tasty gelato. While enjoying the amazing flavors, two police officers came to warn us about insects in the grass that could bite us. They didn’t speak English well but heartily tried to convey their message. In the end, they smiled and waved to us before moving on to another group of people.
After two full days in Florence, having walked over 30 kilometers each day, my friend stayed to rest in the city while I decided to visit Siena. What seemed like a casual trip to a nearby city turned into a wonderful adventure. I didn’t expect anything special and was pleasantly surprised.
Siena is a small city in the heart of the Tuscany region. The first thing I encountered was the Medici Fortress on my way from the railway station to the city center. The massive yellow stone building caught my attention with its high fortress walls. I guessed there might be nice views from the top, and I was right. It was afternoon, and from the top, I saw a magical skyline, a clear blue sky with thin white clouds, and wide verdant hills in shades of green. Then, I entered the old city. Its narrow streets led me into a labyrinth of yellow and red stone buildings that protected me from the hot Tuscan sun. A welcome coolness covered my shoulders and made me shiver a bit. I didn’t have a map, so I followed the signs on buildings and asked people for directions. The signs led me to the stunning Piazza del Campo, with its massive Palazzo Comunale and Torre del Mangia in the center of the town. The square was full of people, cafes, noise, and street vendors. There wasn’t enough space for all the tourists. I walked a few steps up from the square and faced the magnificent Duomo, which dominates Siena’s city center. It wasn’t as big as Florence’s Duomo but still very impressive. That day, I returned to the hotel very tired. Going up and down the hills was more exhausting than usual walking.
Rome, where history intertwines with modernity, is a place of contrasts, both noisy and peaceful.
An ancient city with a vast historical heritage, Rome impresses you from the first steps. I’m not referring to the arrival by train, as the railway station, while not the ugliest or dirtiest I’ve seen, is still somewhat unpleasant. After the relative calm of Florence, Rome overwhelms you with its noise and crowds. Initially, I thought the city itself would be less crowded than the railway station, but I was mistaken. Wherever you go, Rome is packed with people in June.
The district where we found an Airbnb flat was far from the city center and didn’t seem particularly safe at first glance, with many migrants and poorly dressed individuals. However, it didn’t feel like a rough part of town, and we didn’t encounter any problems. So, we left our bags and ran to explore the city.
As I mentioned before, I visited Italy fourteen years ago, including Florence, Rome, and a few small cities. I had dreamt of returning as an adult to not only see and remember everything but to truly experience it. Italy is all about the gesticulating Italians, the smell of pizza and coffee from every corner, enjoying your dinner with pasta and wine in small cafés with lovely views, and soaking in the special atmosphere that is unique to this country.
We planned to see the most famous sights like the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and the Vatican. We marked these spots on the map and decided to walk through the beautiful old streets rather than use public transport. We also didn’t plan where to eat, leaving it to chance, which added a spontaneous and adventurous spirit to our journey.
Compared to other Italian cities, Rome feels very big and noisy. I suppose it was peak tourist season, so we were a bit unlucky in that regard. Near all the major attractions, you constantly hear street vendors calling out “Cold water — 1 euro” or “Hat, buy a hat.” You simply want to enjoy the view and take photos, but it’s almost impossible due to the crowds and the persistent sellers.
We did a quick loop around the Colosseum, hurried by a strong, sandstorm-like wind. We delved into the labyrinth of streets and found another Roman gem — the Trevi Fountain, the largest Baroque fountain in the city and the most famous in the world. Unfortunately, the situation was the same there. The small square was overcrowded with tourists, making it difficult to get close to the fountain. We decided to return early the next morning, hoping it would be less crowded.
The next day, we woke up very early and by 6 a.m., we were already at the Trevi Fountain. The atmosphere was completely different from the previous day. The fresh morning air was much more pleasant than the scorching day heat. There were only a few tourists around, allowing us to enjoy the view. This was the perfect time to walk around the city and appreciate its ancient masterpieces. We had enough time to admire the gorgeous statues and throw a coin for luck into the blue water while the statue of God Oceanus watched us attentively. Bathed in the soft light of sunrise, we moved on to the Spanish Steps.
The Spanish Steps connect the Piazza di Spagna at the base with Piazza Trinità dei Monti, dominated by the Trinità dei Monti church at the top. The marble steps, polished by thousands of feet, shone in the bright sun. Lazy, yawning tourists began to appear, and we even saw several weddings having photo sessions on the steps.
We continued our walk and arrived at the Quattro Fontane square, an ensemble of four Late Renaissance fountains installed in the 16th century at the intersection of Via delle Quattro Fontane and Via del Quirinale. The morning sun was starting to bring its summer warmth, and we chose the shady side of the road as we headed toward the Vatican.
The Vatican hardly needs an introduction. There’s plenty of information available in any guidebook, but I advise you to plan your visit carefully. Be aware of Catholic holidays and check the opening hours of St. Peter’s Basilica.
Standing in front of one of the largest churches in the world, I remembered an episode from my childhood. When I first visited with my mom, it was nearly dark. Yellow lamps cast a warm glow over the square. Our driver, who didn’t speak English well, tried to tell me something in Italian. Finally, he pointed to the Apostolic Palace and said, “Papa. Roma. Window.” It was the most memorable moment of that trip. Though I enjoyed the old buildings and their significant history, I couldn’t fully appreciate them as a child. However, that summer night, standing near the native who proudly showed me the Pope’s window, I felt something incredible. As an ordinary girl, I was standing just meters from the head of the Catholic Church and the Vatican, whom I’d only seen on television. It felt almost magical. As an adult, I felt the same childlike wonder when we returned. I showed my friend that window with a warm smile, remembering the Italian driver.
After a busy day of walking, we moved to the most beautiful and colorful area of Rome — Trastevere, which feels like a different city. After ancient forums, ruins, and historical sites, there isn’t as much to see, but the atmosphere is entirely different.
The busy city blurs in the dim sunlight as we step into the Trastevere area. Its narrow cobblestone streets are picturesque, lined with ochre-colored buildings entwined with bushy green plants, arched passageways, and old doorways with antique door knockers. Don’t miss this atmospheric place. My friend from Rome recommended a café known for its famous pasta — tonnarelli. Although there was a long queue for a table, it was worth the wait. The outdoor tables, warm yellow lights, loud emotional Italians, and delicious food created a recipe for small happiness.
We finished our pasta late in the evening and took a walk around the city. It had completely transformed. The day’s heat had given way to a fresh breeze. Tourists had disappeared from the streets. Bright day colors had faded, replaced by ochre and dark brown hues under the cozy yellow street lamps. Magic was in the air, filling us with complete happiness.
The next day, we left Rome. It will always hold a special place in my heart. Rome is where treasures can be found around every corner, and even the most unassuming streets hold incredible history. You just need to ease your mind and enjoy the city, where history intertwines with reality in a quaint way.

We Landed in Rome and Froze: What No One Told Us About Italy in March,https://escapeartisan.medium.com/we-landed-in-rome-and-froze-what-no-one-told-us-about-italy-in-march-245ca0a0f8ce,"Sign up

“You packed what for Rome in March?”
That was the customs officer, eyeing my linen jumpsuit and flip-flops as if I’d just stepped off a cruise ship in the Arctic. To be fair, I thought March in Italy meant early spring. Blossom-scented breezes. Aperol spritzes under the sun. The Colosseum is adorned with charming gowns.
Instead, I stepped into what felt like a chilly Roman version of Seattle. The wind whipped through my bones. Locals wrapped themselves in puffer jackets and scarves. And there I was, dragging my tiny carry-on and an overinflated ego through cobblestone streets in socks that were basically social distancing from warmth.
Let me save you the frostbite. Here’s what I wish someone had told me before that first trip.
Italy in March sounds like a dream: off-season travel, fewer crowds, blooming landscapes, cheaper everything. And yes, that part is true.
But what your dreamy Pinterest boards don’t tell you? March in Italy is moody. One moment you find yourself soaking up the golden sunlight on the Spanish Steps, and the next, you find yourself sprinting through an unexpected downpour. The weather changes its mind more often…

After the problems with my passport finally subsided (not so funny story: it was expired and I had to leave the country to renew it, but couldn’t leave the country with an expired passport), my family decided it was time to venture out further than our usual trips from northern to southern California and organize our first visit to Europe. The planning process was strenuous as each of us tried to melt our ideas of the perfect adventure together, but looking back I could not be happier with how it played out. One of the most memorable experiences, in fact, was our two-day deviation from the mainstream: Quercianella.
Rather than hitting every crowded tourist destination in Italy, we rented a car in Florence and drove down the Tuscany coast, stopping first at Sienna, and then ending at a miniature beach town by the name of Quercianella.
A town where you could count the number of restaurants on your hands, and every resident was likely on a first-name basis, this was the epitome of an escape. The air smelled of salt and the temperature was perfectly warm. Every one there seemed care-free — families walked freely on the sides of the road, shop owners sipped coffee outside, and you could see locals laying on the stretches of rock and beach basking in the sun and purely enjoying the company of friends or a good book.
After driving down the town’s narrow roads for a while, we found our “Villa Margherita” and unpacked starved, ready to uncover the local wonders. Being a Yelp-connoisseur, I offered to scour the food scene, but soon realized that Yelp did not carry much weight in this little town. So, we slipped on our sandals and just began to walk. After following the main road for a few minutes, we turned onto a street with a gelateria on the corner, and quickly found a pizzeria nearby.
We sat outside on a string-lit patio and soon began speaking with the waiter, who also happened to be the owner’s son. In contrast to the people working the service desk at the hotel, with whom we had to communicate through vague hand gestures, he spoke a great amount of English. It was a comforting revelation, since the town probably did not get many tourists coming from the US. So, taking advantage, my dad asked for dish recommendations. He told us to get a pizza each, as they were personal-sized and he could easily finish one or two. We probably should have known that his idea of personal would differ than ours, however, and when he brought them to the table, all my sister said was “it’s almost bigger than me!” I wasn’t complaining though; we ended up taking the leftovers for a late-night snack.
At the end of our delicious meal, we were greeted by another unexpected surprise. We began talking to the owner and his son about where we were from (Palo Alto, California), and the son’s face suddenly lit up. It turned out he had lived a couple miles away from us for ten years while working his past job, after which he decided to take some time to move back home and work with his father. Our meal then turned into a night of laughs and good conversation as we exchanged stories of California and got to know the family of the pizzeria.
Even in a seemingly random beach town, we found a connection to our home thousands of miles away. The unexpected link was a reminder that we live in a minuscule world where the owner of a pizza place you happen to stumble on in Tuscany could very well have once been your neighbor.

When I travel alone, I am the complete opposite of someone who obsessively plans every part of their journey. I obsessively try to avoid planning as much as humanly possible until the absolute last minute when I need to figure out what I’m supposed to do before my flight back home.
Back in Autumn 2023, during a month in Puglia, I suddenly felt I’d spent enough time eating focaccia in Bari, and decided to visit the coast of Salento, specifically a charming beachside town called Gallipoli. A few hours by local train later, passing through rolling hills and small charming Apuglian towns, I was there.
I walked around the historical center, ate pizza, and enjoyed the perfect weather and view of the beautiful Ionian Sea. None of my pictures do the place justice, especially considering I went to the beach without a camera or phone (since I went alone), so I was unable to capture the most magical sunset I have ever seen in my life — as the sun hit the horizon, a lone tree on a small island acted like the iris in a…

Italy is an extraordinary country that blends history, art, culture, cuisine, and natural beauty in an unparalleled manner. From its ancient ruins to its vibrant cities and picturesque landscapes, Italy has captivated the hearts of millions. In this article, we will explore the various aspects that make Italy unique, from its rich history to its diverse regional offerings.
Italy is often called the birthplace of Western civilization. The ruins of ancient Rome, providing remnants of its powerful empire, speak to its historical significance. The Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon are not just tourist attractions; they are testaments to a bygone era that shaped architecture, governance, and law in many parts of the world.
The Renaissance period flourished in Italy, primarily in cities like Florence, Venice, and Milan. This cultural movement saw the emergence of remarkable artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, whose works have left an indelible mark on art and culture globally. The legacy of the Renaissance continues to influence modern design, art, and literature.
Italy boasts an astronomical number of art treasures. The Vatican Museums, showcasing works by Raphael and Michelangelo, are one of the most visited destinations in the world. Additionally, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence houses masterpieces from the likes of Botticelli and Titian. The sheer volume of artistic genius within Italy’s borders is unmatched.
Italy’s architecture is as diverse as its regions. The iconic Leaning Tower of Pisa, the intricate Gothic facades of Milan Cathedral, and the romantic canals of Venice star in the country’s architectural repertoire. Furthermore, the charm of small medieval towns, with their cobbled streets and historic buildings, add to Italy’s architectural allure.
Italian cuisine is celebrated worldwide, but what makes it distinctively unique is its regional diversity. From the rich risottos of Northern Italy to the fresh seafood of the Amalfi Coast, each region offers unique flavors and traditions. Dishes like pizza, pasta, and gelato have their roots in specific locales, showcasing the country’s culinary heritage.
Italian culinary excellence is tied to its commitment to high-quality, local ingredients. Olive oil, fresh vegetables, cheeses, and meats play a crucial role in traditional dishes. The Mediterranean lifestyle, which is intrinsic to Italian culture, emphasizes a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, promoting wellness and enjoyment of food.
Italy’s landscapes are incredibly varied. From the rolling hills of Tuscany, adorned with vineyards and olive groves, to the stunning cliffs of the Amalfi Coast, the country’s natural beauty is breathtaking. The Dolomites in the North attract outdoor enthusiasts with their rugged peaks, while the serene beaches in Sardinia offer a slice of paradise.
Italy is home to the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world, with over 58 sites. This includes the picturesque landscapes of the Cinque Terre, the historical and architectural wonders of Venice, and the cultural landscapes of the Val d’Orcia. Each site tells a story of the intertwined relationship between nature and human creativity.
Italy’s cultural calendar is sprinkled with festivals that showcase the nation’s heritage and local traditions. Events such as Carnevale in Venice and the Palio di Siena draw crowds with lively parades, colorful costumes, and thrilling horse races. These festivals provide insight into the local way of life, uniting communities in shared joy and celebration.
Italian culture places a strong emphasis on family and community. Meals are often shared events, where multiple generations gather to enjoy traditional dishes. This communal spirit fosters a sense of belonging and reinforces the importance of relationships in everyday life.
Italian is often considered one of the most beautiful languages in the world. Its melodic tones and expressive vocabulary contribute to its uniqueness. The language is also a significant part of Italy’s identity, with numerous dialects reflecting the rich diversity of various regions.
Italy has a rich literary tradition, with significant contributions from authors such as Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Umberto Eco. The literary works originating from Italy often explore themes of love, philosophy, and human experience, reflecting the nation’s diverse cultural heritage.
Italy is synonymous with high fashion. Cities like Milan are considered global fashion capitals, housing revered designers such as Valentino, Prada, and Gucci. The Milan Fashion Week is a pivotal event in the fashion industry, showcasing cutting-edge designs and trends.
Beyond fashion, Italian design is celebrated in industries such as automotive (Ferrari, Maserati), furniture, and architecture. Italian designers prioritize functionality while maintaining a strong emphasis on aesthetics, leading to innovative and timeless creations.
Some of the top tourist destinations include Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, and the Amalfi Coast. Each of these locations offers unique attractions, historical landmarks, and cultural experiences.
The best time to visit is typically during the spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) when the weather is pleasant, and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak summer months.
It is advisable to dress smartly in Italy, especially when dining out or attending religious sites. Comfortable walking shoes are also essential for exploring cities and towns.
Must-try dishes include pizza Napoletana, pasta carbonara, risotto alla Milanese, and gelato. Each region has its specialties, so be sure to explore local cuisines.
Overall, Italy is considered a safe country for tourists. However, it’s wise to stay vigilant and take standard precautions against pickpockets, especially in crowded areas.
Italy’s unique blend of history, culture, cuisine, and stunning landscapes continues to inspire travelers from all over the world. The country’s rich tapestry makes it not only a destination but also a profoundly dynamic experience that lingers in the hearts and minds of those who visit.

This post was written by Meaghan Boyd, a senior majoring in marketing with a minor in journalism. Boyd spent two months in Florence doing an internship through CEA, a study abroad program that places students in a company based on their interests. To learn more about study abroad opportunities in the School of Business, click here.
At the beginning of 2021, I never thought I’d be able to make my study abroad dreams a reality. My efforts to spend a semester in Paris were thwarted time and again as the pandemic dragged on and I began to lose hope.
Then less than a month before departure, my study abroad program decided to cancel its Paris program for the summer, citing COVID-19 concerns. In lieu of Paris, they gave me the opportunity to do an internship in Florence, Italy, instead. I decided to go for it, praying that brushing up on Italian on Duolingo would be enough for me to get by in the country. I hardly believed my summer 2021 plans would work out until I stepped onto my first flight out of St. Louis.
As I sit here three months later, I couldn’t be more grateful for the turn of events that brought me to the birthplace of the Renaissance. During my two months working in the country, I learned many lessons, made great friends and had my own sort of renaissance.
I interned at a small, artisanal wine store in Florence’s city-center called Vino al Vino. Sales had slumped due to the pandemic and a subsequent lack of tourism, so I was brought in to assist with marketing efforts. I wrote product descriptions, took product photos, created social media content and tasted a bunch of local wine.
After working for a couple hours on my first day, my boss asked me why I hadn’t taken a break yet. This was my first brush with the differences between Italian and American workplaces. In my experience, Italians spend much more time chatting over tiny cups of espresso than fretting over KPIs. The work atmosphere is relaxed, and personal lives are not left at the door. Some of my fellow interns would spend hours talking to their co-workers about what they did over the weekend or the most recent Euro Cup playoff game (Forza Azzurri!).
In addition to a casual work environment, straightforward communication is common in Italy. If your boss doesn’t like something, they will tell you. If they do like something, they will tell you. This was off-putting for me at first, but I learned to appreciate the bluntness. If your boss feels they can be honest with you, that is a compliment. It’s also important to have a sense of humor about yourself; you should be prepared for a little gentle ribbing from time to time.
Wine is a product imbued with passion. Vino al Vino only stocks wines from small producers across Italy and some of the most respected wine regions around the world. These producers engage in the laborious task of producing wines without additives, sulfites or GMOs, many of them following biodynamic principles that require them to hand-pick their grapes, maintain native insect populations and so on. Many see their wine as a love letter to their land, with some plots being owned by their families for hundreds of years. The owners of the store taste every bottle that makes its way onto the shelf (including every vintage) and visit most of the producers’ vineyards personally.
All this effort is in service of the final conversation with the customer. Most patrons come into Vino al Vino in search of “a white wine for tonight.” The owner has a conversation with them about their tastes and pulls several options for them based on their preferences. This is the core competency of Vino al Vino — understanding their product and their customer.
The time, energy, and love that goes into producing and selling this wine makes it uniquely valuable. In Italy, you can buy a bottle of wine from the Carefour Express on the corner for less than 1 euro. But, it’s the artisan winemakers and passionate distributors that make Italy’s wine market so renowned across the world.
The store lacked a fancy layout and high-class finishings but made up for it in service. In order to be in the business of wine, this is all that is really important. The customer is buying into an experience, a lineage, centuries-old technique, and an expert’s recommendation. The service creates half of the value for a non-expert.
Most companies understand their product much better than they understand their customer. Vino al Vino knew their product very well, but they also knew how to explain its value to the customer and this was crucial for them. I may not work in the wine industry for the rest of my career, but I can apply this principle to any product.
For a year-and-a-half before I left for my trip abroad, I spent all of my time behind a computer screen. I rarely interacted with others or left the house for more than an hour at a time. That made adapting to life in Florence that much more difficult. All of a sudden, I was surrounded by people who spoke another language, taking trains to unfamiliar destinations and meeting tons of new people.
Over the course of the two months, I surprised myself with how much I changed. I was more open to new experiences and said “yes” more often. I was able to navigate my friends and myself through buses, trains, metros and water taxis. I even picked up a little bit of Italian (well, just enough to have some polite conversation with the grocery store clerk).
Learning to step outside of my comfort zone allowed me to have many unique experiences that I am so grateful for. I visited a winery in a small Tuscan village where nobody spoke English, drove a speedboat around the island of Elba, took a painting class at a tiny studio in Florence’s city-center, tasted boar, truffles, and scary-smelling cheeses, watched Italy win the Euro Cup for the first time since 1968, and made great friends I’ll cherish forever.
Though it was stressful and downright scary at times, it was worth it simply for the fact that I am very proud of myself. Not bad for an introverted homebody! I feel empowered now, like I can take on the world.
So, if you are considering studying abroad, do it. It’s worth all the trouble of applying, flying, and freaking out when you get there. Beyond the once-in-a-lifetime experiences, academic opportunities, and Instagram photos, the most valuable part about study abroad is what it teaches you about yourself.

GOSPEL songs — earworms! — play in my head constantly now after two intense weeks of learning them with a choir touring Tuscany. We weren’t a choir before we boarded our respective flights, but we are a choir now.
And right now I can ‘hear’ a very beautiful Italian prayer-song, Signore Delle Cime — Lord of the [mountain] Peaks — in my mind and I, a non-believer, am nevertheless deeply moved. Who wouldn’t be?
Signore Delle Cime asks the Lord to take ‘our friend’, a fallen mountaineer, up to heaven covered ‘with a soft white blanket’. It soars.
Then there was Bella Ciao, the rousing hymn of the partisans who would die for la liberta. It seems all Italians know that one.
The 30 singers in our choir are mostly Australian and we also have a sassy soprano from Canada who lives in New Zealand, three terrific tenors (Scotland, Canada and New Zealand), and an Irish lass, our scintillating soloist and queen of the altos, who lives in Melbourne.
We learned songs, mostly gospel in nature, in Italian, French, Samoan, Zulu (yes!) and English. And we performed a selection of them in two churches, one in the gentle medieval town of Mercatello sul Metauro in the Marche region that borders Tuscany, and another in Firenze. (The angelic altos are pictured above.)
Our maestros were exceptional talents — Guerrino Parri in Mercatello, Edoardo Materassi who taught us in the first week of our tour in Montestigliano, near Siena, and in Firenze, and Tony Backhouse, who taught us for the entire two weeks. Many readers will know Tony from his acclaimed Sydney-based choir, the Café at the Gates of Salvation Gospel Choir, as well as his Heavenly Light Quartet. That’s him, below, with Guerrino in the background getting ready to begin.
Each of these three conductors was a joy to watch at work. So knowledgeable — so animated! — and able to sing each part (bass, tenor, soprano, alto), they lifted us up with their energetic love of the music and of teaching it. What a joy.
Members of Guerrino’s choir in Mercatello joined us for our concert there, and in Firenze we were treated to exceptional performances by Edoardo’s choir, Animae Voces, who also joined us for some tunes.
Now I am in Anghiari, ‘my’ beloved medieval village near Arezzo, very happy to be here again so unexpectedly soon, thanks to one person dropping out of the singing tour before it began. [I spent last November and December here.] ‘Making Music in Italy’, organised by a Byron Bay-based outfit, The Create Escape, had been fully booked when I inquired about it months before. When I tossed my cap in, I assumed it unlikely that a spot would become available — but it did! So, with just four weeks to get myself prepared — flights, insurance, what to do after the tour, and so on — I said yes. Life is short, yes?
I have always eschewed the idea of group tours, but now I am very glad I took what felt like a leap of faith and dived in. The accommodation in Montestigliano, Mercatello and then Firenze was excellent and interesting in different ways; we ate sumptuous meals, had some lovely parties and stimulating side trips as well as the pleasure of learning. (You can see a snippet of one of those parties here.)
One of the side trips was to the hilltop restaurant Il Girone dei Golosi just out of Mercatello; another was to the beautiful organic winery Pomaio near the town of Arezzo where we went for lunch on the way to Firenze (see pics below).
I’m sure we all made some lovely new friends. (And here I must make special mention of Susie and David from the Northern Rivers who had the brilliant idea of making this tour the first leg of their honeymoon! It was a treat for all of us to have them along.)
Now I’ve seen more of Tuscany than I had before. It is my fifth time visiting Anghiari and I’ve opted to spend a month here to catch up with acquaintances I have come to know and love. After all, the airfare is just the same for six weeks as for two, isn’t it?
A presto. Mimi :)
PS: If you would like to see the choir in action, some parts of our concerts can be found on YouTube. Go to ‘Making Music in Italy, 2024’. You’re welcome. xx

It was June 2023 when I drove to Italy for 3 weeks to find a second house or a renovation project in Italy. I had sold my house in the Netherlands as I felt it was time to move forward without any mortgage. Freedom.
Initially I was focussed on moving to Spain. My boyfriend’s native language is Spanish, and learning Spanish is already a challenge. Putting another language in the mix like Italian, didn’t feel very useful. Long story short, I couldn’t get a homy feeling in Spain, and I always loved and felt connected with Italy. Italy it was.
Like many house searchers, Idealista is a great way to start. With a long list of 50+ houses I drove to my preferred area around Lucca and further up the coast in Liguria. Obviously many houses weren’t at all what they seemed online, but more, I couldn’t see myself living in those areas. Secondly, I was all over the place with what I was looking for: a nice holiday home or a golden gem like a big mansion to renovate.
Having one week left, I went back to the heart of Piemonte where I had spent the first 2 nights. I ended up in a B&B owned and run by Francesca. We clicked and I loved the area: the rolling soft hills with its vineyards, the laid back little villages with one bar in the center as the communal place to meet each other for coffee or an aperitivo.
I visited some more houses in the area but nothing came even close to making my heart jump a tiny bit with excitement. This is not the right way, I felt. Let’s reverse the process: stop hunting, trust that life will show me what or where to look next. As a side note, I always bought the houses I lived in very intuitively, which has never let me down. In fact, it has given me a lot of financial expansion over the years.
I just posted my ‘I trust the universe’ post on facebook when the cousin of Francesca stepped into the garden. 10 minutes later, he offered to show me his house down the road that he bought a year ago. Would I be interested to buy his house as his plans had changed?
Is this a sign? Curious as I am, I said that I would be open to explore. It wasn’t love at first sight. It wasn’t the Liberty House from early 20th century with heigh painted ceilings I was hoping to find, but it was huge! And that ignited my interior design excitement. I love a good renovation challenge! I have had my design business for 13 years, and although I never see myself in that role again, I love to be my own client!
3 Months later I signed the contract, and became resident in one day. The house, with a potential of 600m2 living space and 14000 m2 land, was mine. Definitely a design challenge as 40% of the house, the barn with its hay attic, needs a complete transformation. For Italian standards the whole process went very smoothly, mainly due to great help I received from the seller!
Why did I say yes? It just felt like the one thing to do. Not just buying it, but to move out of the Netherlands immediately and start something new. It all felt right: the potential of the house with 7–8 bedrooms and the potential for an equal number of bathrooms, living spaces to share and some to keep private, enough space for my children to come and stay, alone or with their friends and the idea of creating a business sanctuary, whatever that will be…I felt a new phase opened up. How exciting!
Back to the summer of 2023. My partner wasn’t as thrilled as I was when I showed him the house the first time. Understandable! His favourite spot to visit, the Netherlands, was suddenly swapped for a rural area with a bunch of farmers. Having a long distance relationship for 6 years now, travelling between Lima-Peru and The Netherlands very frequently, has worked well for us, but will it be the same with my drastic move?
While I didn’t really involve my partner in the decision, I did involve my 3 (young adult) children! Perhaps not realising the complete impact of this move, they were supportive of my choice. I feel blessed with their ability to give me this space although it certainly hasn’t always been easy for them for different reasons.
So here I am, 14 months later. A year of learning and rooting. Slowly learning the language. Connecting with the ground I live on. Making the house with simple means a home for now until the renovation is done. Enjoying the simplicity of life in the country. Meeting so many beautiful new people, of which a few are becoming good friends.
And of course, not everything goes easy and smoothly. My renovation started with a classic mistake, trusting the wrong person and ignoring my inner doubt as I was too eager to get started. It has cost me quite a sum of money with which I had come to terms with for myself. I felt so angry and frustrated but also a bit ashamed with my mistake. Shouldn’t I know better as an experienced renovator and intuitive person?
I stopped working with the first contractor, continued with his collaborating partner (as he was a victim of the whole situation as well) to finish the terraces and new swimming pool. Normally one starts with the house and the outer areas are last on the list. For sure it will turn out quite unpractical to have a new terrace while the whole house needs to be taken care of, but I am so happy I enjoyed a first summer with a lovely space outside and my beautiful new swimming pool. At least the pool can’t fall of the budget anymore! A lovely first summer, sharing it all with friends, family, and of course my children.
While I moved on my own to a country where I didn’t know anyone, I can’t say I ever felt alone or lonely. In fact, in between all the visits, and my own travelling to the Netherlands, Peru and some other places, I am happy to have some weeks on my own. I love the different seasons: fresh sunny spring, warm rain free summer, foggy autumn mornings and cold winters with the snowy mountains of the Alps as a postcard view from my terrace.
And the house? For a while I didn’t want to renovate it at all. I live so comfortably already, and I have enough rooms for guests to stay. My youngest spontaneously brought 7 friends for a week around New Years Eve. My son enjoyed a week in the summer with 6 of his friends! And you know, sharing 2 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms worked fine for everyone.
But after a few months, I felt the excitement bubbling up for the next phase of the renovation. I refreshed my skills so I could use my design software again. It had been a while but I really loved solving this big puzzle. How to make the best out of the house. This part had always been my favourite element of my interior business: creating the most optimal living spaces, a natural flow, all within the limits of the building and a budget. To me it is the definition of simplicity: creating such a design that solves all complexity (integrate all wishes affordably, elegantly, beautifully and within the limited space) while the results looks very natural like the house has always meant to be like that. In other words, I don’t like over designed houses for the sake of creating something new and expensive.
The house had grown on me, which made me change some of my initial ideas. I finalised the complete design in September. Now what? How to find the right contractor(s) this time? One that is flexible to find affordable and beautiful solutions: my budget is limited and my standard is high! But more importantly, finding one who is willing to work differently from the very bureaucratic way that is known in Italy and very costly in my view.
I did hire a geometra. A geometra works within the triangle of the municipality, the contractor and the house owner. A geometra can easily take 15–20% of the budget as an add on! That is excluding the costs for an architect, an interior designer and an engineer (for constructive calculations). I decided to hire my geometra only for the permit, the (ridiculous but mandatory) safety and security rules and some engineering guidance. I followed the same process as I did in the Netherlands for many years to receive budget proposals from 4 contractors. Well, that already made a pre-selection. Two of them resigned as they didn’t like my way. They would only give a quote based on the standard procedure here where the geometra prepares the whole costing format. Basically this means, they only have to fill in the price per item and you get a very clear overview per contractor what his offering is. Sounds great and good for comparing budgets, but quite costly for me and way less flexible.
Now I am left with 2 parties who both feel like good companies to work with. One of them is very eager to grow his business and the other has an established contracting business. I haven’t finalised the deals yet, but it feels like the project will be divided amongst these 2 parties.
I am excited to get started, to work with the workers wherever I can, find solutions and the right materials. I am best when I can design the little details in the moment.
Please follow along in this blog to read about my weekly updates, surprises, joys, fun facts and challenges as I navigate this BIG project!

Italy is a beautiful country, full of history, culture, and delicious food. But what if I told you that you can explore and enjoy this country to the fullest without compromising on your lifestyle as a digital nomad? As someone who has stayed in over 2000 hotels across Italy, I specialize in finding mid-range accommodations with a budget of €60–110 per night, focusing on 3 or 4-star hotels. My experience has taught me to strike a balance between comfort and cost, making the most out of each stay without going to extremes.
In this article, I’ll share with you some of the best tips and tricks I’ve learned along the way. But this is just the beginning! Throughout this series, we’ll go beyond the basics of “where to stay” and “what to eat,” diving into the practicalities of living well on the road: how to maximize your experience, find hidden gems, and maintain a high quality of life that goes beyond mere survival.
Who Am I?
I’m a digital nomad with a unique perspective. I work as a technical consultant for a multinational company, splitting my time between freelance projects and a steady job that takes me all over Italy — and sometimes beyond. Because of my work, I’m always on the move, and I’ve made it my mission to find the best places to live, eat, and work remotely, no matter where I am.
But unlike some digital nomads, I’m not willing to live like a “poor man” nomad, squeezing myself into the cheapest hostels and cutting corners just to get by. I also refuse to become a “digital hermit,” living in isolation away from the pulse of the cities. Instead, I aim to thrive — finding a balance between comfort, productivity, and enjoyment. And that’s what I want to share with you in this series.
What Does It Cost to Travel Well in Italy?
Let’s start with the basics: What does it cost to travel well in Italy? I’m not talking about scraping by on a tight budget. I’m talking about a lifestyle that includes good food, nice hotels, and experiences that leave you feeling fulfilled.
How to Travel Around Italy Efficiently
Italy’s public transportation system is good, but knowing how to navigate it can save you a lot of time and stress. However, unlike many digital nomads, I don’t often find myself traveling between big cities like Rome and Milan, where trains are ideal, or from Rome to Catania, where a plane would be the obvious choice.
Why and when Traveling by Car is Essential in Italy
Unlike in many other countries, my job rarely takes me to the major hubs like Rome or Milan, where trains and planes would be the most practical options. Instead, I travel to small towns and villages off the beaten path — places that are hard to reach by public transportation. If you’re in a similar line of work, it’s crucial to understand that the car becomes your lifeline.
Driving in Italy is not only a practical necessity but also a way to fully experience the country. Italy is densely populated and full of charming towns and villages that are worth exploring. Driving to get your groceries or grabbing a beer in a small village becomes an unparalleled experience!
Given the layout and structure of Italian towns, unless you want to be a “caravan nomad” moving with public transportation, a car is essential. And if you enjoy driving as much as I do, it’s an experience to cherish rather than a burden. Italy is not like Spain, where cities are spread out and public transport is a more viable option. Here, the car is strategic. I’ll share with you some tips on how to make the most of it and save money while you’re at it.
Tips for Enjoying Your Hotel Stays
One of the perks of my job is staying in a wide variety of hotels. Whether it’s a 5-star luxury resort or a small boutique hotel in a hidden village, I’ve learned a few tricks to make every stay more enjoyable:
The Joy of Exploring Small Towns in Italy
One of the true joys of traveling around Italy is exploring its many small towns and villages. Every region has its own charm, and the people are often warm and welcoming. The best part? Even in the most remote locations, you’ll rarely feel isolated. Unlike in some other countries, where you can feel like a stranger in the countryside, in Italy you’re more likely to be invited to a local event or to share a meal.
This is why you’ll never feel like a “digital hermit” in Italy — unless you choose to be. The density of the towns and the hospitality of the people make it easy to connect, network, and create meaningful experiences, no matter where you are.
Wrapping It Up
Italy has so much to offer, and it’s possible to experience it all without compromising on quality. This is just the beginning of a series of articles where I’ll explore various Italian and European destinations, sharing what it truly means to live well as a digital nomad.
Stay tuned for more articles where I’ll dive deeper into specific cities and regions, sharing hidden gems, recommended hotels, and, of course, the best places to eat. Because living like a digital nomad shouldn’t be about “making do” — it should be about living well.

This was originally published on The Unexplorer.
Under the Tuscan Sun. Eat, Pray, Love. If these books are anthems that sing of your dreams of moving to Italy, join the club.
And yet, while many women (myself included) do successfully create a new life in the land of pasta and prosecco, many others return to their homeland after just a few months or years, unable to rectify the dream with the reality of living in Italy.
Before you sell everything you own and buy a one-way ticket, here are a few reasons you might want to reconsider this plan.
I get it. Politics/the economy/[insert something else here] suck where you live. You’re dreaming of escaping the rat race for a better life in Italy.
But I’ll tell you a secret: things aren’t perfect in Italy either. In the south, there’s an extremely high unemployment rate (15% versus a national average of 8.2%). Politics are wonky here too, depending on your leanings. Oh, and then there’s the mafia.
When you run away from what you consider a less-than-ideal life, you aren’t setting yourself up for success in your new home. And as you know, problems follow you.

Buongiorno! One of my favourite countries in this world? Italy! Pizza, pasta, and wine in masses, all under the dry heat of the sun with some of the most lovely people on earth.
This is one of my favourite places on earth, hands down. It is the kind of Tuscan village you see in movies and on postcards. Driving there on the street with cypress trees on both sides takes you back in time. Yes, this village is a little touristy but it is gorgeous and when in Tuscany, you need to go here. Nestled in green nature near the Mediterranean Sea you can find small restaurants, cafes, gelato, interior decor shops, wine and Italian specialities, it has everything your touristy Italian heart could ever desire. Go to the cafe in the middle of the town and treat yourself to an Espresso con Coretto (or with Grappa, they have both) with some Cantuccini or pastry of choice. Get lovely Ice Cream (the Bolgheri flavour is mouth-watering). Take a little sniff at the room perfumes in the interior store left from the gate.

Have you ever felt emotionally affected by a place that seems untouched by time? Matera is a city I love visiting. It’s a place that left an impression on me when I took a childhood church pilgrimage with mamma, and it’s a place that so instantly brings a great sense of appreciation to my life.
During a not so recent trip to Italy, I visited yet again this magical UNESCO site I encourage everyone to visit at least once, except this time I experienced the most humbling moment. As I was standing at the Chiesa Di Santa Maria Di Idris (Saint Mary of Idris), I was overwhelmed by the beauty and history surrounding me. As I walked through the church, I struck up a conversation with Rocco, a kind, older gentleman who volunteers to maintain this sacred space. His genuine interest in sharing the church’s history, with my genuine curiosity to know the deep roots of this sacred timecapsule, immediately fostered a sense of trust. He invited me to a hidden space behind the church, a small terrace with a breathtaking view of the cave dwellings below. As I stood there, looking out over centuries of history, I was moved to tears — this was more than a moment; it was a connection to the soul of Italy. I found myself at the mercy of a moment so raw, so full of the history and struggles of the people who lived and fought to survive there, that I was left breathless, feeling like I was part of something much larger, something that words alone could never express. After I took it all in, we returned inside, chatted some more, exchanged numbers and I left with the greatest gift of Matera — learning it’s history from someone who’s parents understood firsthand the art of making do with very little, and living a life of ration — something I boldly claim none of us reading this have any understanding of.

The Alps are the highest and the most extensive mountain group in Europe, extending across 8 countries: France, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia.
In this chapter, I focus on the road trip I did last year on the first nine days of May, driving from Southeast Switzerland to northern Italy, Tyrol Austria and Liechtenstein. If you prefer only to visit the Swiss Alps click here.
The last stop in Switzerland before crossing the border to Italy.
Lake Como
Driving along the lake’s road through the towns of Domaso, Menaggio, Lenno, Laglio…and at the southern tip Como, where we stayed a night.
Picturesque and romantic city
Lake Endine
A smaller lake also in Lombardy and the perfect stop to stretch our legs and have a lunch break before reaching Lake Iseo.
Lake Iseo
Views to Mont Isola at the island of Lake Iseo were breathtaking so we decided to stay here for the night.
Hiking trails connecting very small ancient villages, old churches, and olive fields with sheep and donkeys.
Lake Garda
Lazise
Bardolino and Malcesine
Riva del Garda
Famous for its beaches, swimming, sailing, windsurfing, hiking and cycling holidays. Here you can paraglide too.
The Dolomites — South Tyrol
Trento, Bolzano and Merano landscapes
Gardens of Trauttmansdorff Castle in Merano
In these gardens so carefully taken care of, you will find flora from different parts of the world, a labyrinth, educational games, experimental landscaping, a restaurant with tasty soup by the lake and views to Tyrol as a background knowing that Austria is right on the other side.
Sterzing — Vipiteno
Hiking in the morning and local market and shops in Vipiteno´s center in the afternoon before crossing the border to Austria.
“Tyrol is a western Austrian state in the Alps that’s known for its ski resorts, historic sites, and folk traditions.” Innsbruck is its capital.
Innsbruck
Ischgl
A famous ski resort, the season had ended a week before we visited it.
St. Anton am Berg villages
Feldkirch
Vaduz is the capital of Liechtenstein or officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, a small country located in an alpine valley along the Rhine river. 38,557 German-speaking inhabitants.
Vaduz
We decided to visit the city half day, walking around the center and visiting the Museum of Art: Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein and Liechtenstein National Museum. Here you discover the Arts, Crafts, and History of this micro-estate.
Italy, and the spring and first love all together should suffice to make the gloomiest person happy.

Out my window in New York I can see a tall white slice of a building where the Russian diplomatic corps lives. In that contained compound, there’s also a long, low building with a big round window, a school for their children. What are the mindsets of people there — especially when they see protesters waving the Ukraine flag across the street? What kind of history lessons do they teach those kids?
I mention this curious, closed-off world because it’s the kind of environment that can send fiction writers down long trails of exploration. And if all their research and imaginings lead to a vivid, unusual tale, readers may scratch their heads and wonder how the heck the writer came up with it.
When I read a new novel by Paolo Bacigalupi, Navola, I did some of that proverbial head scratching. It’s set in an alternative version of Renaissance Italy, filled with deception, vast wealth, and cut-throat power plays. So many questions surfaced in my mind, which led to some unexpected discoveries.
Before getting into that, here’s a little bit about Bacigalupi and the novel. If you’re a sci-fi fan, you might have gone head-over-heels for his first published novel, The Windup Girl, which picked up two of the most prized awards in the genre, a Hugo and a Nebula, along with other honors. Maybe you read some of his work that came after that — until he disappeared from the literary scene. Then last year, he rose up once again with Navola.
This marks the first time that Bacigalupi has dived into the fantasy genre. He sidestepped many of the usual suspects — magic spells, knights, princesses, witches, elves. But he did dust off the old dragon trope and gave it a strange quality. We first learn about it in the book’s opening paragraph, which begins:
“My father kept a dragon eye upon his desk. An orb larger than a man’s skull, gone milky and crystalline but still burning with inner fire as if it retained life.”
MISFIT IN A POWERFUL FAMILY
The narrator is a boy, and later a young man, born into a banking family. The young scion, Davico, may be extraordinarily wealthy, but he can’t meet the huge expectations of the father he so reveres. Davico is educated in warfare and how to perceive the dark secrets that are rife in Navola, the city-state where he lives. He pushes himself to become a master negotiator and to achieve far-reaching knowledge about all the bank’s clients. But he seems to always fall short. His passions and natural gifts lie elsewhere.
One of his gifts has to do with that dragon’s eye. The relic isn’t mentioned very frequently and seems inert to everyone but Davico, who senses its pent-up power. It seems like it’s going to do something. But what? I read much later into the night than I should have, wondering about that.
Another reason for my sleep deprivation had to do with a character named Celia. She arrives just after Davico’s father wreaks revenge against her family, which had plotted to overthrow his power. The father decides to adopt Celia, giving Davico an unexpected sister. It makes for an awkward introduction.
Over the course of the novel, Celia transforms from a subdued, quiet girl into a vivacious wit who is able to navigate through the treacherous, opulent world much more easily than Davico.
A third reason why I couldn’t stop reading relates to Bacigalupi’s master skills of foreshadowing, teasing the reader about what’s to come without giving much away. Consider the confessional tone of Davico in this passage, which is addressed to his readers:
“I have lost interest in hiding who I was or what I have become. I am tired of the lies and excuses, and wish only to lay myself bare before you, so that you at least will understand, even if you do not forgive.”
In addition to all my curiosity about where the book was headed, I also started to wonder about Bacigalupi’s inspirations and how the book had come about. It was so different than what I’d read of his other work.
It wasn’t hard to discern that novel’s world was some ancient version of Italy. Bacigalupi also invented certain words, gestures and body markings that seemed to borrow from Italian culture. But where was that all coming from? With a name like Paolo Bacigalupi, I assumed that he had an Italian family history. I was wrong.
My research uncovered an unexpected set of circumstances. Navola’s storyline came to him at a time when he was no longer interested in exploring the sci-fi topics he’d become known for, like changes in the world due to extreme weather and bioengineering.
‘NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,’ NEW AVENUE
He explained his mindset in a Write-Minded podcast interview: “A lot of the [future] trends that my brain locks onto are the frightening ones. And so you end up spending time being sort of anxious in your daily life. And then you go into this creative space where you actually expand on those anxieties and go deeper and deeper into them. And it builds this sort of, I don’t know, synergistic toxicity. And eventually I just broke down, fundamentally. I kind of had a nervous breakdown.”
A new way forward gained momentum during a trip to Italy with a friend, who wanted to learn Italian by living in Bologna. Bacigalupi had gone along for the ride. But it turned into so much more than that. Italian architecture and history proved fertile ground for his imagination, and that’s so evident in Navola’s landscape.
“One of the things about Bologna was all these rival families in the city would build these towers, and they were defensive towers for their families, but they were also statements of wealth and importance,” he told Locus magazine in a December 2024 article.
“The landscape is telling you something about politics, saying, ‘Oh, this city is not a cohesive political unit, even though you’ve got a wall that goes around the whole city — inside it, there are armed factions who war with each other, and retreat into their towers when they’re unsafe, then come out and attack each other. They’d imprison one another in their towers, all sorts of stuff. You can see this layer of anarchy clearly established in the architecture, and that’s not something that I would have organically thought of, but it’s something that I could observe and then steal and bring into my own world.”
There was at least one unexplored story thread in Navola that I kept waiting to play out as the pages turned. And while it never did, I suspect it was a little hint about what’s to come. At the time he was interviewed by Locus, Bacigalupi had written 60,000 to 80,000 words of a sequel book. As with Navola, it will be published by Knopf.
“I’m going to let the story be as long as it wants to be. If I need to go back to Knopf and offer another book, I’ll do that. If I can wrap it up elegantly in two, I’ll do that,” he said at that time. “I’m trying to be as loose as I can with it and allow the thing to take on the shape that it wants.”
With or without that dragon’s eye, I’ll be waiting.

Favorite Chocolate Shops in Italy
With Valentine’s Day, thoughts turn to chocolate. Here’s an excerpt from “100 Places in Italy Every Woman Should Go” to help you find the best places for chocolate in Italy…
“Let them eat chocolate,” was the kind proclamation of Madama Reale.
The year was 1678. Madama Reale was thirty years old, widowed, with a boy to raise, and had become the ruler of the Piedmont region in northern Italy. She took her job seriously and carried on major beautiful changes to the city during her reign , continuing in the tradition her husband had began, remodeling the Palazzo Madama into pretty French style.
In Madama Reale’s day chocolate was a precious novelty served only to royalty and priests. It had come to Italy through the Spanish explorer Cortez, who found it in South America.
When a Turin baker asked Madame Reale’s permission to make chocolate for regular folk, I imagine she figured, “Why not?” She probably needed the seritonin fix to deal with the hassles of being a female ruler and wanted to pass on the high to keep her popularity ratings up.

Or how a Balinese priest told me who I would marry
“There’s a wonderful old Italian joke about a poor man who goes to church every day and prays before the statue of a great saint, begging, ‘Dear saint — please, please, please… give me the grace to win the lottery.’ This lament goes on for months. Finally the exasperated statue comes to life, looks down at the begging man and says in weary disgust, ‘My son — please, please, please… buy a ticket.”
That profound realisation is from the blockbuster book Eat Pray Love. In the iconic movie scene, Julia Roberts says these words while overlooking ancient Rome. I have seen this film time and again, but I didn’t realise it until last year — did I just relive Eat Pray Love itself?
Dear saint, I did buy three tickets years apart… to Italy, India and Bali… and my lottery is a prophecy.
Italia… amore a prima vista! I was a teenager on my birthday when I first set foot in Italy. The fact that I don’t recollect the exact year is evidence that I speak of time long passed. It was a high school trip and my highlight was Casa di Giulietta (or Juliet’s house) in Verona. I revive the memory of a line of people flocking to this medieval tiny courtyard with one wish in mind — to find true love. Standing before the statue of Juliet, supposedly where Romeo wooed her, I was observing how everybody was writing their names on a wall, followed by symbols and dates important for them, as well as the name of their crush, husband or partner.
And then there was me. I found myself in front of the wall with a pen in my hand. I wrote ‘’Mila’’ followed by a tiny doodle of a heart. And then I looked up to the sky and set out the following intention ‘’I left the space next to my name empty. Let whoever is meant to be with me, write their name next to mine. And let the universe do its magic and introduce me to that person in divine timing.’’ Something inside of me as a young girl told me that I was probably the only one who did that.
But the woman in me today knows who wrote their name next to mine.
Namaste, India! It was my 21st birthday. The land of contrast. The thing about India is that you either love it or you never want to go back. I fall in the first category. I call to mind entering a Hindu temple for the first time in my life. ‘’No phones allowed’’ — it said on a very high fence. As a 21-year-old just entering the era of Instagram this is the last thing you want to hear. ‘’Well, I don’t have a choice’’ — I said to myself while proceeding to entering the temple. If you have been to India, you know that New Delhi is chaotic. Yet, somehow this Hindu temple was the trailer to how tranquillity feels like in the hustle and bustle of the big city.
The only time before that I was in awe of a building was in Barcelona when I entered La Sagrada Família. But Akshardham Temple in Delhi was something magical. This was the exact moment when I fell in love with India, Hinduism and Asia. I stood in front of the central sanctum and in a trice I couldn’t see anyone else. It was just me and this massive gold statue before me. The entire world went still. It was a fleeting moment, but it was something that I couldn’t explain to myself. What I know for sure, though, is that if I had my phone with me I wouldn’t have had this memory.
Om Swastiastu, Bali! I had to go back to Asia. The older you grow, the more life pushes you to search for peace, meaning and answers. ‘’Om Swastiastu, Miss Mila, my name is Ketut, nice to meet you.’’ No way. Did he say Ketut? I just rewatched the movie Eat Pray Love (which is by the way based on a true story) on my flight to Bali and if you have seen it, you know who Ketut is in the story. To make the picture even more unbelievable, Ketut that stood before me is a local priest in Ubud.
One morning, before inviting me to a Balinese family celebration that happens only once every 30 years, we had a talk about life. I shared that I wanted to visit a local palm reader. Sometimes when you’re desperate, you look for answers from places you never thought you would run to. ‘’I do’’ — he said, ‘’but you don’t have time for this today… have you visited The Pyramids of Chi? I think you should go’’ — said Ketut, accompanied by a witty smile, as if he almost knew what would happen there.
Like I wrote in another article, the gods always travel incognito. Ketut was convincing in an almost demanding way, leaving me with no choice but to go to those pyramids. I went to the reception and asked for a ticket for the first session available. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was in a pyramid built on top of a rice field, about to meditate to the sound of a gong. And let me tell you — I was the type of person that could never do yoga or meditate.
I still find it hard to put into words what happened to me that morning. I started having visions, one of which was a very specific necklace with a lotus flower. Once the session was over and it almost felt like I just woke up for the first time in my life, my legs took me to the giftshop. And guess what — that exact necklace I saw in my meditation was sold at their shop! I got goosebumps. A receptionist approached me and said to me ‘’Miss, this is the last necklace.’’ Nothing is a coincidence and signs do exist.
A year later, fate took me to Bali again, despite planning to go to Thailand instead. I had to go back to those pyramids again. I needed more answers. It was not an easy task to revisit a place without the burden of the expectations from the first time. However, I told myself that if those visions are a reality and not just my mind playing tricks on me, I must see the number 17 immediately when I leave the pyramid.
The sound healing was done. I ran to grab a piece of my favourite peanut butter chocolate cake and drink a comforting cup of ceremonial cacao. The woman at the counter handed me a note with a number and told me to put it on the table so they know where to bring my order. I grabbed it without looking and started playing with a frangipani flower that fell next to me. I sat down, a waiter brought my cake and to my astonishment I looked up — the table number I was given was… 17. And next to the cake the word ‘’love’’ was written with strawberry jam.
Then I went back to my homestay and Ketut asked me the mandatory question of how my day was. How do I tell this man that he sent me to a place that changed my life? I was looking for a palm reader, but I ended up being my own palm reader. What really made my jaw dropped was what Ketut asked me. ‘’Mila, do you have a partner?’’ and before I could even respond he continued — ‘’You have already met him, I saw him’’ and then with that same smile he gave me last year, he walked away and wished me good night. He saw him? What did he mean?
I don’t really have an ending for this story. An ending would imply that a cycle is completed. Yet, why does it feel like this cliffhanger by a Balinese priest is just the beginning? Or maybe I myself started this prophecy by writing my name on a wall in Italy over 14 years ago? And… what if maybe he also told me who I will marry?
Let’s connect!

The morning started off with my phone having not charged during the night. Then as we rushed out of the house I realised I had forgotten it.
Fortunately just a minor inconvenience as I’d only gone a few metres before patting my pockets and realising I didn’t have it. But now the battery was low and we needed the phone for our journey. Rail tickets, buying metro tickets, plane boarding passes and Uber on arrival.
This trip was just a short 6 day visit to Italy — 3 days in Rome and 3 days in Florence. The occasion, celebrating the 80th birthday of Roger, our long time round the world travelling companion, who was coming from South Africa to Italy to celebrate his birthday with his family in Venice.
As my phone charge was low I used the time on the train from Aveiro to Porto to charge it. But as I gathered my extra jacket and luggage the phone fell on the floor.
I didn’t realise I didn’t have it until I needed it to pay for the metro tickets. Frantic patting and searching was in vain. It was on the train on the way to Spain!
After explaining my predicament to Sara at the Campanha station ticket office, she immediately contacted…

This article was originally published in Spanish and you are invited to read it as well in my beautiful language here
I am not a psychologist. I could read a bunch of books to find answers to questions like why we enjoy dreaming, and why we love idealizing places, people, and situations… but I’m too lazy to do that.
All I know is that if you idealize your life, it’s probably because you like living in a self-generated Matrix avoiding some problem, denying it, or worse, you’ve always lived that way.
Nowadays, however, we have a huge choice of online resources, and it’s possible to get a real sense of what a place might be like: ideal for living or vacationing, boring or lively, safe or dangerous. You have the chance to even interact with its inhabitants long distance or, simply ask travelers about their experiences.
A few months ago a video of a girl went viral because she was complaining about how to get to Amalfi. She said she had to fly to Naples, take a train to Sorrento, a ferry to Amalfi, and finally climb lots of stairs to reach her hotel — all this in the height of summer, with that heat! Can you believe it?
She said influencers should be jailed for saying things that aren’t true… (deep breath…)
Here’s the thing: living is easy with eyes closed, but today you don’t have excuses. You have to be in the here and now. Whether it’s Instagram, YouTube, a book, or an article, you must remember that someone’s version of a place or an experience is subjective and probably idealized. You need to be aware that what you’re being sold on social media is either driven by economic convenience or because the person in question is feeding their delusion, trying to rope others into their fantasy.
You can’t plan your vacations, your life, or your career based on the ideas others give you. You have to go out into the world, connect with people, try, smell, ask, think critically, question, and then decide what to think, how to act, what to do, and where to go.
Mistakes are always lurking around the corner — you should always keep that in mind — but I can assure you that you’ll feel less frustrated knowing that you did everything yourself and consciously made the effort for your project to succeed.
Having said all this, I imagine you now understand why I said “No” in response to the title of this article.
But maybe I’m not so good at explaining my thesis, so here it is:
No, it’s not beautiful in Italy or anywhere else if you’ve decided to see life through filters, through the eyes of others — call them dream sellers, rich kids who study or live abroad, or immigrants who haven’t adapted to a new lifestyle or who’ve endured years of bitterness before achieving a decent standard of living and showing it off to you.
Life is beautiful only when you look at it with your own eyes and your ideas. It’s beautiful with both the good and the bad — not just when you see it through the Deep Summer filter.
Wake up!

Departing Zermatt was unfortunate but necessary. We had seen the Matterhorn so there wasn’t anything else we could do with Yuki’s parents like hiking, biking or parasailing. We got up extra early to take the Train from Zermatt to Brig, anticipating that the 7 minute change at Brig would not be enough time. It ended up being more than enough time and after arriving an hour early, there was also a train to Domodossola, Italy, that we were able to take. There wasn’t, however, a train from Domodossola to Milano so we had to wait an hour in Domodossola instead of Brig. This wasn’t too bad because we ate another lunch of hard boiled eggs on rice and walked around the street market just outside the station.
Our initial impression of Italy was that it seemed to be a lot like Paris, only rougher with stone sidewalks and cobblestone streets. It was busy like Paris and there was clearly a wide disparity in wealth from beggars upwards unlike Switzerland which felt empty, organized, clean, and safe.
The train to Milano was very scenic. I drafted up some blog posts but also admired the beautiful scenery. Not far from Domodossola are some turquoise blue lakes and romanesque architecture with clay tile roofs that look like they could be easily centuries old. This got me exited for the next two weeks of seeing old architecture. The view became steadily less interesting as we approached more urban areas and soon we were in Milano.
Milano station was where be found out that the Italians are poor at scheduling. The train stations have large digital display boards with the departure and arrival of all the trains but they look exactly like the old school letter flipping boards. The departure platform for a train might not be displayed until 15–20 minutes before departure and that creates a mad scramble of people who were all waiting around the display board craning their necks up like weird penguins. The people swarm towards the platform, not unlike an unbalanced crowed of birds because they are all pulling along baggage. This occurs ever 5–10 minutes. When one train of people leaves, another arrives to refill the crowd around the departure board.
The train to Venice wasn’t all that interesting because it was mostly through urban areas that are noticeably modern but still in the same romanesque style of plaster brick walls and red tiled roofs. It’s actually a little like Asia; you can tell that the buildings are modern but they’re rundown and stained. To pass the time, I played the one Ipad game I’d bought for the trip, Dragonfall.
We arrived in Venice around 5pm and had a 30 minute, 2km walk to the hotel. Yuki had google mapped the route the night before and taken screen shots so that we could get there. I’m sure that it took us much longer to get to the hotel as every time we cross a canal we had to lift our suitcases over little pedestrian bridges. Between canals, we scooted down narrow alley ways that widened and narrowed like a child’s drawing who couldn’t draw straight.
Eventually we got to the hotel, tired and hungry. Checking in was straight forward and we were taken to our room around the corner that was a king bed and a folding bunk bed. Yuki and I were dejected to find out that we had booked another common room for the four of us. On our last trip to South Korea with her parents we’d been careful to book our own separate room whenever possible. For some reason, while planning this trip we forgot about that and ended up booking everything but Paris as a single room with four beds to save costs. We regretted this decision and were suddenly filled with low morale. Note to self: always book a separate room no matter the cost, It’s worth the brain cells and reduced stress.
This hotel in Venice only had wifi in the lobby and even there it was pretty crappy. I tried finding a highly rated restaurant on google maps but google doesn’t have most of the restaurants in Venice and what I found didn’t exist so we ate at the hotel’s restaurant.
The food was okay but not to our liking. We all had seafood dishes but there was very little seafood in each dish, it was mostly lobster or shrimp shell. The good part of the meal was that we got 35% off for being a guest at the hotel so the meal was pretty cheap.
Where the hotel lacked in dinner food it more than made up for at breakfast. We had an excellent self-serve buffet breakfast at the hotel that had cereal, breads, and fresh fruit. It was my favourite breakfast thus far and I finished early to take a quick walk around the end of the island we were staying at. The light had looked good for photographs but I was a little late and didn’t see anything worth photographing. On the way back to the hotel I did pass an American model and a film crew that I think they were doing a commercial.
We planned for one day in Venice to walk around as Yuki had been informed, there’s enough to do spend one day in Venice but two days would be excessive. This is because there are so many alleys, plazas, and bridges that they all blend together.
Our first stop was to get to the Plaza S. Marco. This is the most famous and the largest in Venice. We took lots of pictures and then went into the Basilica S. Marco. At the door Yuki was asked to wear a scarf because her skirt was above her knees. Other tourists were given thin blankets to cover up but beyond the lady at the door checking people none of the tourists seemed to actually bothered keeping themselves “decent”. Yuki thought it was going to be free but it was 5 Euro/person. It was worthwhile though, because at the top we got a view of the plaza from the roof. When 11 o’clock rolled around we got to watch the clock animate and brass figurines hit the bells to ring them.
As it was Sunday, there was a service in the main hall. There was a choir and a lot of singing that sounded wonderful in the cavernous space. This Basilica was more interesting than Norte Dame because it also had a museum where we could get up close to some of the artwork. The entire interior of the cathedral is covered in little tiles, most of which is backgrounded in gold. Though the museum signs have english, it didn’t make a lot of sense so after a while we stopped reading them and instead stood in the main hall to listen to the music of the mass.
Around the corner from the Plaza S. Marco we found a small gelato store and got two scoops on a cone. The Gelato here was incredible and significantly tastier, smoother and better than Canada. This shouldn’t have be a surprise, given that gelato originated in Italy, but it wasn’t something that I had expected before taking my first lick.
Wandering on, we crossed the famous Rialto bridge and then had lunch at an outdoor cafe beside the canal. The food was pretty good. Yuki had lasagna and I had a spinach salad with dried fruits, bacon, and a really interesting cheese. We also ordered Spritz Apoele, a popular drink in Italy that everyone seemed to be drinking. It wasn’t my favourite but it wasn’t bad either.
After lunch we headed towards the train station to get tickets for the next day’s train, stopping for more gelato on the way. We were very grateful to have the help of a young woman with the ticket machine and decided to also get most of our other tickets for the trip because we had her to guide us through the process. This girl was really helpful and turned what could have been a very frustrating and difficult situation into an understandable time.
For future reference, its best to book train tickets at least two days in advance. The prices are cheaper by a significant amount and the train isn’t full yet. The day before or the day of, tickets are more expensive and seating is difficult to find.
From the train station we walked back to the hotel and had a brief rest. When we were hungry, we went out and walked the streets again in search of a good restaurant. The cafe restaurant we choose had a good proportion of food and lost of seafood in the dish but the ambience wasn’t as nice. Still, I enjoyed the meal and the 1/2 bottle of white wine I ordered. Yuki had to help me finish it.
We had another great breakfast at the hotel and then left early for the train station to ensure that our slowness did not make us late. Leaving Venice was a lot easier than arriving. On the way back to the hotel the day before I’d found a route that had ramps over the bridges so we were able to return to the train station with half of the bridges turned into ramps and fewer canals to carry our bags over than before.
We arrived 40 minutes early and waited for the train platform. Annoyingly, the car numbers on the side of the train were different from the TV screens on the platform so we and several others got on the wrong car. We were able to get off and onto the right car with a little stress and hassle and were happy to be settle into our seats for the journey back to Milano.
The train was 30 minutes late because of some police incident so we only had around 15 minutes to change trains in Milano. When we got on the train, Yuki’s bag was open, an unsuccessful attempt at a pickpocket, and somehow papers from Yuki’s Dad’s inside breast pocket ended up on the table. I think there were two girls that opened Yuki’s bag while we were getting on the train and when we got to our seats, instead of sitting down to get out of everyone’s way Yuki’s Dad stepped right in the middle of the crowd and those two girls took the papers out but then left them on the table because they weren’t valuable.
We double checked our valuables a nothing was gone so that was good. The rest of the train ride to Levanto was mostly uneventful. We chatted with an Australian couple and anguished over not having any food so we were quite hungry when we arrived in Levanto around 5pm. We talked with the tourist office and got a map to walk to the hotel. It turns out that the hotel is run by a travel agency that also manages a B&B and a few apartments. For unknown reasons they upgraded us from a studio hotel to a one bedroom apartment with the ocean view. This was a huge boost to our morale and made us very happy.
The apartment was on the third floor and had a balcony with a view of the beach and the ocean. It was particularly nice to sit out and watch the sunset. The apartment also gave Yuki and I a private room and there was a much needed laundry machine that we used daily during our stay.
Internet was interesting, they gave us a portable modem with a little battery. I suspect that it ran on data and could, conceivably, be taken out to the beach or where ever but we left it plugged in beside the bed.
I’d asked the lady from the travel agency for a good restaurant and she recommended the one across the street so we went there for dinner. It was without a doubt the best meal so far. I had 5 grilled shrimp, Yuki had seafood ravioli and Yuki’s dad had the best mixed seafood calamari ever. To top it off, I had a great 1/2 bottle of white wine and Yuki got a very sweet white wine that her dad finished in two swings. We should have gotten more of that wine because we weren’t able to find it again.

This is the third time in my life that I have been a tourist. The first time was in 1975 when I was traveling with a guy, and he was a tourist. I had hitched a ride, and he wanted to see the Eifel Tower, Notre Dame and the cathedral in Cologne. He also wanted to eat pastries — I found it bizarre. We parted company, and I found another ride. Thankfully, it was less than a week.
The second time was with my daughter last December when we went to Valencia together. We had (and have) very different ideas of what travel means. For me, it means skipping all the tourist places, wondering around the streets with a camera — walking for many miles each day, just looking at the buildings and the people. For my daughter, it means going to museums and other tourist attractions. For her, it mean eating in restaurants to try out new tastes. For me, it means going to the grocers, buying tinned sardines, a bread roll, and keeping food cheap and healthy. I’ve no interest in eating out.
And then there’s now.
Each January, there are travel sales. Ryanair was offering return tickets to Rome for €30. I thought I would take advantage of that, although I’ve never had the slightest interest in either Rome or Italy. As a…

Italy and Japan are also in a similar situation. Yet in Italy for example, Spain and other countries, there are entire villages with mostly empty houses; the state even pays foreigners to move there. Distance working enabled by excellent fiber optic connectivity to rural areas has to be a big part of the solution; I don’t see many others.

Italy is a journey through history, a celebration of art, cuisine, and natural beauty. This summer, my family and I embarked on a two-week Italian adventure. From the ancient ruins of Rome to the enchanting canals of Venice, we were ready to uncover Italy’s timeless wonders. But, like any true adventure, it brought a few unexpected twists, a bittersweet farewell, and memories we’ll carry for a lifetime. Here’s a chronicle of our journey through history, heaven, and a touch of heartache.
Our trip took place in August, making it perfect for a family getaway. We dedicated two weeks to truly experience Italy from end to end. For planning, AI proved invaluable, offering detailed itineraries and personalized tips at every stage. With its help, we crafted an itinerary covering the major cities: Rome, the Amalfi Coast, Florence, and Venice.
Here is my prompt to AI. You could expect multiple follow up prompts that will help you with better plan (example: plan by hour), new choices and alternate options. Here is the final plan I used for my trip.
Here is my trip plan to Italy. Suggest major attractions in the below cities I will be visiting. Provide transport options for travel between cities. Recommend Italian local restaurants at each location: 1. Rome — 1.5 days 2. Amalfi Coast — 1.5 days 3. Florence — 2.5 days 4. Venice — 1.5 days
Rome is where history stands tall. Walking through the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, and Pantheon, you’re not just visiting landmarks — you’re breathing history. These sites evoke goosebumps as you imagine the lives of kings, soldiers, and citizens who once walked these grounds. If you’re planning to visit, consider skipping the line at the Colosseum (it’s worth it). A guide is optional but can really enhance the experience, bridging past and present.
Leave the history at Rome. What awaits you are Mountains on Amalfi Coast, cool Winds of Florence, Cinque Terre — Story of 5 Villages and Gondolas of Venice.
Mountains on Amalfi Coast
As you travel through Italy, you will see mountains everywhere; Mountains on land and Mountains on coast line. The Amalfi Coast felt like a slice of paradise, where mountains meet the Mediterranean. The scenery here is surreal: vibrant villages perched high on steep cliffs, overlooking turquoise waters. Our Airbnb, nestled high on one of these cliffs, offered a stunning panoramic view of the coastline. A boat and snorkeling tour along the coast was a highlight — an immersive journey into hidden caves, secluded beaches, and warm Mediterranean waters.
Winds of Florence
Florence has a charm all its own, with a magical cool breeze that welcomes you. Known for its art, culture, and incredible cuisine, it quickly became a family favorite. Florence is also an ideal base for day trips to Tuscany’s famed wine regions and charming medieval villages. The restaurants here are a treat, offering some of the best Italian cuisine we’ve ever had, which our kids loved too.
Cinque Terre — Story of 5 Villages
We chose to visit Cinque Terre, 5 villages along the beautiful coastal region. These villages stand on steep hills (it’s common across Italy) along the sea with houses colored with various colors. Villages are connected by sea, trains and trails. You can trek mountains to reach across villages. At Cinque Terre, you experience natural beauty, rich history, and Italian culture. You will see how Italians relax and enjoy life.
Gondolas of Venice
No trip to Italy is complete without visiting Venice, the “City of Love.” Surrounded by water and navigated by gondolas, Venice feels romantic in every sense. Its narrow, winding streets, centuries-old art, and serene canals create a timeless beauty that makes you feel like you’ve stepped into another era.
As the trip drew to a close, emotions ran high. Physically exhausted, we encountered an unfortunate incident when one of our bags was lost at the Rome railway station. Not a great feeling when you lose what is yours. Cops were of no help. We were grateful to have all our travel documents intact. Pickpockets are real, take warning seriously, keep an eye on your belongings!
We’d have taken more day trips from Florence and been more vigilant about pickpockets.

My family rented two Polestar 2 cars for a week long jaunt from Rome to Florence and around the Tuscan countryside, where we stayed at a beautiful villa for five nights, for a total around 1000 km. The catch was that the villa was sited for gorgeous views at the peak of a local hill on a farm that was accessed by 4–5 km of gravel road, depending on direction of approach. We obtained fast DC charging on the highway away from and back to Rome (more later), but there was no convenient fast charging near the villa.
The Polestars came with an EU wall outlet charging cable, so we were intent upon charging from outlets just inside the front and rear doors. Fortunately, the proprietors left out two grounding plug adaptors that mated with the Polestars’ cable, and we were off. Both outlets were on a single breaker, so only one car could be charged at a time, but at 2.3 kW, wall charging is faster than in the USA, and we were able to share the juice and obtain enough for extensive day trips in Tuscany. The catch was that the owners were unhappy with our solution on grounds that it violates their solar array agreement, which specifies “agricultural uses”. They did accept a nominal payment in compensation, however. We of course argued that they would benefit from offering this as a feature in their AirBnB listing.
On the highway, we charged at an Enel X charger at a shopping center, which offered only one 50 kW DC fast charging spigot with 5 slower Level 2 spigots. This was typical of most charging stations across Italy. So we had to time-share the two cars between a fast and a slow spigot, which seemed absurd coming from our experience with Tesla superchargers featuring at least 4–8 100–200 kW spigots per installation. A second session at a Evviva charging station benefitted from four fast spigots, but the initial 140 kW soon dropped to 70 kW when the second car was added.
Thankfully, the Evviva station recognized our Enel X app, but this was not at all apparent without some coaching from another EV driver who was incredibly helpful. The onboarding for Enel X charging had been quite painful, requiring download of an app, entry of quite a bit of personal information, and manual entry of credit card information. My attempt to register for an account was unsuccessful on three successive tries, but I was able to pay as guest, and the app put me in good shape for later charging on the Evviva chargers. But here’s the question:
Why is it possible to purchase fuel at most any gas station using only a credit card reader, but not at an EV charger? Who is blocking the adoption of a modern process for entering only the most rudimentary validating information (e.g. zip code), or more recently, simply tapping a card or a phone, without the frustrations of downloading apps or entering extensive personal information to set up “accounts” that are totally unnecessary?
For heaven’s sake, give me a charge and TAKE MY MONEY, already! We don’t owe you a database.

While it may seem obvious, if you do not already speak Italian to some degree, you will really need to buckle down and make learning the language your number one priority when you move permanently to Italy, as not being able to communicate freely with Italians could create some very challenging situations.
Recently, I spoke with an English-speaking foreigner who relocated to Italy approximately five years ago. Despite their limited knowledge of Italian, they made minimal efforts to enhance their language skills during this time. Unfortunately, this individual developed an illness that required communicating with multiple doctors. Due to the language barriers faced by the foreigner and the limited English spoken by the medical professionals, the individual believed they received a misdiagnosis and may now face a permanent health issue due to their inability to understand the doctors’ diagnosis. Of course, there are two sides to the story, and without being present, one cannot know for sure what truly transpired, but one thing is for sure: not being able to speak Italian to a certain level certainly caused stress, worry, and a sense of isolation. This episode was such a negative experience for this person that they decided to leave Italy permanently.
Unfortunately, when I moved to Italy, I had no idea that it would become my permanent home. Had I known this, I would have arrived in Italy with a more extensive vocabulary than just ‘ciao’ and ‘grazie’. My first two years in Italy were particularly challenging because I didn’t have a solid grasp of Italian. This meant that I had to either seek out services where people spoke English, which often came at a premium, or I literally had to go around with a dictionary. Of course, with the advent of apps on one’s phone that can translate for you, things have become much easier. However convenient this can be, there is nothing, in my opinion, like being able to freely converse with another person.
The internet is now filled with articles that promote living a laid-back life in one of Italy’s small towns, where one can take advantage of the 7% tax program. However, given that these towns are made up of 20.000 or fewer inhabitants, and that many have older populations, it is safe to say that finding people who speak English may be rarer than a hen’s teeth. This could, despite one being happy with their life in such a town, lead to feelings of isolation if you do not speak Italian well enough to be able to hold a conversation, albeit a simple one, especially at the beginning. In addition to this, we, as foreigners who have chosen to make Italy our home, owe it to Italians to make the best effort we can to learn their language.
While Italians may be forgiving when you learn their language and make mistakes, there is no doubt that they truly appreciate it when a foreigner makes a genuine effort to learn Italian. This is particularly true in a business setting, where the Italian spoken can often be very formal. As a result, Italians generally value the ability of a foreigner to express themselves effectively in Italian and who fully understands the use of ‘Lei’ and ‘Tu’ in this context.
It is fair to say that some people and certain nationalities seem to be more gifted at learning languages, and the same is also true of Italian. That said, we owe it to ourselves, as well as to Italians, to learn the language as well as we possibly can, and here are five reasons why we should do that.
If the above five reasons are not enough, believe me when I say that you do not want to have a root canal, for example, or some other medical procedure if you do not fully understand the medical professional. You also don’t want to talk with an Italian accountant if you don’t understand completely what they’re saying. In addition to this, bonding with Italians and creating lifelong friendships are much easier if you can speak to them in their own language.
Learning Italian can take time and patience, but the rewards will be worth it. Don’t keep putting it off; start today. Even learning just one new word a day means you have learned three hundred and sixty-five new words in a year!

If you’re someone who daydreams about chasing la dolce vita, you should know that while many of us adore living in Italy, this country has plenty of problems. Some of these problems show signs of fixing, and others will likely take generations of cultural and behavioral changes to resolve.
Here are some particular reasons not to move to Italy, or at least reasons to keep in mind before doing so.
I once dated a kind, educated Italian man in his late 20s who seemed to say all the right things. He was vegetarian, had been to therapy, had healthy boundaries with his parents, and was a self-proclaimed feminist.
What a score! I thought to myself.
Unfortunately, he also thought it was appropriate to rank potential female hires by how hot they were. He sincerely thought that I’d enjoy hearing about how he and his male coworker — in their male-dominated Italian office, within a male-dominated industry — had added an extra column in their hiring spreadsheet to rank potential female hires as “hot”, “not hot”, or “maybe hot”.

Italy, a country located in Southern Europe, is globally renowned for its rich history, stunning landscapes, delicious cuisine, and vibrant culture. From its iconic historical landmarks to its contributions to art, fashion, and automotive design, Italy continues to capture the hearts and minds of people around the world. In this article, we will explore the various facets that contribute to Italy’s fame and allure.
Italy is often referred to as the cradle of civilization, thanks to its pivotal role in ancient history. The Roman Empire, one of the most influential empires in history, originated here and left behind a remarkable legacy of architecture, law, and governance. Landmarks like the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon stand as enduring symbols of this glorious past.
The Renaissance, a period that marked the rebirth of art, literature, and science, also originated in Italy. Cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome became the epicenters of intellectual and artistic achievements. Great minds such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael produced masterpieces that are celebrated worldwide today. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence and the Vatican Museums in Rome house some of the most important works of art in existence, drawing millions of tourists every year.
Italian cuisine is another significant reason for Italy’s fame. It is internationally adored and has heavily influenced culinary traditions worldwide. Dishes such as pasta, pizza, risotto, and gelato are not just staples of Italian food but have become favorites in many countries.
Italy’s culinary scene is incredibly diverse, with each region offering unique flavors and specialties. For example, the rich and hearty dishes of Northern Italy contrast sharply with the fresh and vibrant flavors found in the South. The Sicilian cannoli and Neapolitan pizza are just two examples of Italy’s gastronomic treasures. Food festivals held throughout the country celebrate local produce, further showcasing Italy’s commitment to quality and tradition in cooking.
Italy has long been a leader in the fashion and design industry. Cities like Milan are known as fashion capitals, hosting prestigious events such as Milan Fashion Week. Renowned designers like Gucci, Prada, Versace, and Valentino have transformed the global fashion landscape with their innovative designs and luxurious collections.
In addition to fashion, Italy is home to several iconic automotive brands, including Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Maserati. The country’s passion for automotive engineering and design is evident in its sleek sports cars that symbolize speed and elegance. The annual Mille Miglia race and the Auto e Moto d’Epoca exhibition in Padua further highlight Italy’s deep-rooted love for automobiles.
Italy is blessed with diverse landscapes, from the picturesque villages of the Amalfi Coast to the rolling hills of Tuscany. The stunning scenery is a significant draw for tourists, who flock to experience the natural beauty and charm of Italian regions.
Italy has the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world, with 58 sites that showcase its cultural and natural heritage. From the ruins of Pompeii to the stunning frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, these sites attract millions of visitors every year, eager to immerse themselves in Italy’s storied past.
Italian art has left an indelible mark on the world, influencing countless artists and art movements. Baroque, Renaissance, and Neoclassicism are just a few of the notable art styles that have roots in Italy. The beautiful architecture found in cities like Venice and Rome also demonstrates the profound artistic vision of both past and contemporary architects.
Italy is known for its colorful festivals and lively celebrations that reflect its rich culture and traditions. Events such as Carnevale di Venezia and the Palio di Siena draw both locals and tourists alike, showcasing traditional costumes, music, and dance. These events not only honor Italy’s deep-rooted traditions but also offer a glimpse into the Italian way of life.
The Italian culture is characterized by warmth, hospitality, and a strong sense of community. The Italian way of life emphasizes family values, hearty meals, and leisurely activities. This welcoming nature is often what draws tourists back to Italy time and again, as visitors leave with not just memories of scenic landscapes and historic sites but also of heartfelt connections with the locals.
Some must-visit locations include Rome (the Colosseum, Vatican City), Florence (Uffizi Gallery, Duomo), Venice (St. Mark’s Basilica, Grand Canal), and Milan (Duomo di Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II).
Italian cuisine is popular for its fresh ingredients, simplicity, and variety. Dishes can be easily customized and offer a balance of flavors that appeal to a wide range of palates.
The best time to visit Italy is during the spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) when the weather is mild, and the tourist crowds are relatively smaller.
Yes, Italians value family, social interactions, and meals enjoyed together. It is common to greet friends with a kiss on both cheeks and to enjoy long meals that include multiple courses.
Italy has significantly influenced art, architecture, music, and cuisine. The country is credited with introducing opera, contributing to Renaissance art, and establishing fashion trends that continue to resonate today.
In conclusion, Italy’s fame can be attributed to its rich historical legacy, extraordinary culinary delights, vibrant fashion scene, breathtaking landscapes, and warm culture. Each facet adds to the allure that keeps people around the world enamored with this beautiful country.

There’s a particular kind of silence that follows the clatter of train wheels on tracks. It’s not empty — it hums with promise, like a deep breath held between moments. That’s how it felt while traveling between Florence and Venice, as the Tuscan hills transitioned into marshy, mystical flatlands. I looked out the window and realized the experience wasn’t just a trip. It was a soft reset.
We came to Italy looking for beauty, pasta, and a break from our over-scheduled lives. What we found was something we hadn’t planned for: space. We found space to think, to wander, and to breathe again.
The idea was simple: seven days in Italy, three cities, one Eurail pass, and zero stress. The itinerary included Rome, Florence, and Venice. A golden triangle of beauty, history, carbs, and vino.
Easy, right?
We even had a spreadsheet with color-coded tabs. Arrival times, museum hours, restaurant reservations, walking distances, and estimated energy levels. I had even listed “snack breaks,” as if spontaneity needed a time slot.
Naturally, on our first day in Rome, our Google Maps history resembled a marathon. We chased every “top 10” list. We reached…

Pinch me! Even now, two months after returning from my dream trip, I still can’t believe it happened. I spent almost a month in Italy, shadowing doctors across different cities while also working as a content creator with international brands. Like what?!
Europe was on my travel list for 2027 – literally a far off fantasy because duh, it’s expensive. But somehow, I got there because I dared to send an email. It all started when doctors in italy slid into my inbox, asking me to create a reel for their brand as a part of a paid collab and in the most “main character” moment of my life, I shot back an email like “Umm how about I come and experience your healthcare system first-hand rather than just talking about it from across the oceans?”
And?? To my surprise, they agreed! I was the first Indian content creator they sponsored a trip for. After a test reel that impressed them with my insights, link clicks, and resulting applications, we booked my first-ever business-class flight to Europe – from Kolkata. I couldn’t hold back my emotions. The little kid in me had a teary eye – I was the first in my entire family to apply for a Schengen Visa, the first to fly out of Asia, the first to go on a sponsored trip, and the first to break all those limiting beliefs.

Last year I went on a month-long journey through the North of Italy. In this article, I want to share some of the highlights that I made on the tour. Additionally, I thought I’d complement my own thoughts with impressions of German writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who visited Italy from 1786 to 1788.
My journey began in Milan, which is the second largest city in Italy after Rome. My first impression of the city was a bit disappointing as I perceived it as quite dirty and ran down. Maybe this was due to the fact that my hostel was located next to the main station, which is not the best area in town.
The hostel itself, however, was very nice. I would do a lot of exploring around the center of the city. Two of the main sites are the Milan Cathedral and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The former was built in 1386, and I highly recommend taking a tour through the Cathedral, including the rooftop.
The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is Italy’s oldest active shopping gallery. It stands out due to its high ceilings, the glass dome in the center, and its luxurious shops and restaurants within the gallery. I found the architecture very fascinating, although it is obviously overrun by tourists.
After a short stay in Bergamo, I headed out to Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliett. Verona has a nice Mediterranean vibe and is home to the Verona Arena, one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheaters.
It was built in 30 AD and is still in use today. Goethe wrote about the amphitheater:
“The simplicity of the oval is palpable to every eye in the most pleasant way, and every head serves as a measure of how enormous the whole is. Now, when you see it empty, you have no measure; you do not know whether it is big or small.”
Although the amphitheater is one of the city’s main attractions, what stood out to me was the general architecture you can find throughout the city. There is a beautiful hill, home to the Castel San Pietro, from which you are able to overlook the city.
Lake Garda, which is easily reachable from Verona, was my next stop. What stood out to me was the panoramic view, with the majestical mountains of the Alps in the background. Goethe was also enraptured by this view:
“How much do I wish that my friends were with me for a moment to enjoy the prospect, which now lies before my eyes. I might have been in Verona this evening, but a magnificent natural phenomenon was in my vicinity — Lake Garda, a splendid spectacle, which I did not want to miss, and now I am nobly rewarded for taking this circuitous route.”
I stayed in a small town called Desenzano del Garda, which is a great hub for exploring the surrounding areas. Even in late October, you are able to enjoy some hours at the lake’s beaches.
My next stop on the list was Venice — a town I have seen so many times in various movies but never in person. So as soon as I left the train station and saw the canal in the beautiful sunshine, I had a big smile on my face. I stayed in a hostel called the Generator, which is located on one of the smaller side islands but offers a great view of the city.
Now, Venice really is a place of its own. You do not need to visit museums or galleries because the city itself is a piece of art. It gained wealth and power between the 9th and 12th centuries and had another very influential phase during the Renaissance. The boats, the houses, the canals. Everything in Venice feels magical, and you could easily believe that the city is a well-constructed theme park.
Note, however, that many tourists are moving through the narrow alleys of which Goethe wrote:
“After dinner, I hurried to first get an impression of the whole, and threw myself (…) into the labyrinth of the city, which, although intersected by canals and small channels, is connected again by bridges and small bridges. One cannot imagine the narrowness and crowdedness of the whole without having seen it.”
After I left Venice and spent one night in Bologna, I headed further south to Florence. Now, if you’re a fan of DaVinci, Michelangelo, or art in general, this city is a must-see! Although I was already a bit tired of the hustling and bustling of all the cities I’d seen, I managed to visit the Uffizi, which hosts one of the most important collections of the Renaissance era.
What I enjoyed even more in Florence was the community kitchen of my hostel — the Yellow Square. Every night a committed group of travelers would gather in the kitchen and share meals and stories of their day. Furthermore, the hostel has a nice rooftop terrace from where you can overlook the city.
Finally, it was time for me to head out into nature. I went to a place called LaVerna — an old, mystical monastery that is located on the top of a mountain. From there, I would start on a week-long pilgrimage along the way of St. Francis, which ultimately led me to the town of his birth, Assisi.

One of the hardest parts of moving to Rome for me back in 1988 was not having any friends initially. A valuable lesson that I learned was not to become friends with someone just because you share a common language. This can be very tempting, especially if you are feeling isolated and don’t speak the local language well enough to make friends with the locals. When you only have a language in common with another person, these so-called friendships can become very draining and even toxic if you don’t share the same values, political views, or life mindsets. For this reason, unless you are moving to Italy already with an advanced level of Italian, please take the time to study at least 90–120 hours of Italian before you arrive. This will give you a lot of choices when it comes to friendships as well as your ability to move more freely within the culture.
While it’s nice to hang out with other foreigners at expat events, especially those who speak your language, just make sure that they are positive about their lives in Italy. You simply do not have the luxury of hanging out with expats who are constantly hating on Italy and Italians. They will sap your energy and chip away at your enthusiasm for why you moved to Italy. I cannot stress enough how you must leave these individuals alone. Just like you must avoid the moaners, don’t overly focus on the negatives in Italy.
As the old saying goes, any road will get you there, if you don’t know where you’re going. Get a plan and really focus on what you want to achieve in Italy, both personally and professionally. Seek out friends and professional contacts that will support your dreams, goals, and objectives.
I jumped in at the deep end when I moved to Italy in 1988, and looking back now, I can honestly say that I wish I had known much more than I did before I got here. I wish I had known back then how important it was to surround yourself with the right people, and how this would influence how you saw your life in Italy — either as going somewhere or not going anywhere at all.
They say that 95% of where you go in life depends on who you know! If this is true, then get out and do some serious networking. I have enjoyed many expat get-togethers, but to be honest, the most important contacts I have made in Italy for my business have been at 100% Italian events. Make sure you have great looking business cards when you go, and most of all, follow up with the Italians you meet!
The DIY approach to relocating to Italy can sometimes be fraught with problems and challenges. I have sat with grown adults sobbing due to their “workarounds” of the Italian fiscal or immigration system. Make sure, especially if you plan on living in Italy full time, that you network with people who can introduce you to savvy professionals like accountants and lawyers.

This past weekend, Italy’s monuments were lit up orange for the #orangetheworld annual campaign sponsored by UN Women and the United Nations on the occasion of the International Day to End Violence against Women.
The initiative was launched by the UN Secretary-General in 2008.
From Milan to Rome, Siena to the Amalfi Coast, many cities in Italy have participated this year. Amazing photos and videos were shared on social media throughout the weekend.
According to Onu Italia, the following cities colored their most famous sites with orange lights:
www.facebook.com
In Rome and around the country, some of the most iconic buildings of the Italian Ministry of Defense also lit up orange.
Across the world, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Italian diplomatic network united on social media to underscore the country’s agenda for protecting and upholding the rights of women and promoting the fight against any form of discrimination and gender-based violence.
“On the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Farnesina wishes to reaffirm its firm commitment to these issues,” reads a message of the Foreign Ministry.
Italy’s engagement rests on the belief that promoting the empowerment of women and girls and fighting against gender-based violence are deeply intertwined.
“By inhibiting the ability of women to enjoy their rights, gender-based violence represents a major hindrance on the road to their empowerment and fulfilment. Likewise, promoting the empowerment of women, based on the recognition of women as political, economic and social subjects, can help to counter violence against them,” the message continues.

Ciao, Italy.
You have started to hold a very special place in my juvenile heart. If there is anything I have ever dreamt of, it is you, Italy. The skies painted in the hues of the Adriatic Sea, the clouds like scoops of vanilla gelato, colorful rumbling vespas like rolling syllables of Italian, men kissed by Michelangelo, women blessed by the Tuscan sun.
I have been fascinated by many places, whom you might know too- UK with its historical charm, France with its elegance and German with its discipline; but there is something unique and different about you, Italy. You can be mandolin in a lively Tarantella on a summer night and the bagpipe in the quiet streets of Rome; and piano is the Ponte Vecchio of these instruments, entwined.
People fall in love with other people in France but I have fallen for you, Italy. It is as if you’ve been sculpted in a way by the divine not to be admired, but to be felt. You have been created for me to awaken long-lost butterflies, the softest goosebumps I thought I’d forgotten. If there is anything I’ve longed for, it has to be you, Italy. I dream to wake up and see your face, feel the morning summer breeze kiss my skin, spending lazy middays penning love letters to you, and dancing in the red-wined soaked air with beautiful souls you’ve wrought.
You fill in the hollow voids of nothingness with ecstasy and a hope, a hope that one day I’ll come to you. I hope to live the sunny daydreams in Tuscany, I hope to eat the best gelatos of my life, I hope to fall for a mark of your splendor, I hope to see Piazzale Michelangelo’s night sky with you, I hope to hear the Basilica’s bells as I pray, I hope to touch the sacred walls as if it’s the divine itself, I hope to smell the different pastas before devouring them, I hope to feel the hurt when I pinch myself, hoping this isn’t a dream.
You aren’t just a place, you’re a promise, a dream, a goal, the perfect end to a happy ending, my happy ending. I promise you that one day, I’ll be coming to you, falling in love more and in your arms. I promise to cry my heart out when I finally meet you, I promise to rediscover the purpose of living there, I promise to unravel all the things you’ve got to say to me, you mysterious gem, I promise to spend my life’s best days there, I promise to never wake up from this dream, I promise to never give up on you, my Italy.   Oh, my unlived déjà vu, I’ll be on my way to you.  One day.   Con amore, Pavitra

Everyone has “a thing” that they do upon their return home from a vacation. Usually, this involves an immense amount of laundry and getting caught up on unread emails.
I similarly follow this trend, except this time. I just returned from Italy, and as soon as I got home, I threw away all of our boxed pasta, canned pasta sauces, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO).
Why?
Because I can clearly taste a difference between prepackaged pasta made with preservatives that I cannot pronounce. I also know that many Italian-sounding olive oils are misleading and not really from Italy at all. The ones I had stocked in my pantry were the kind that I got suckered into buying because it was on BOGO, and I will compare the consistency to motor oil now that I have had the real thing.
During my 10 days touring Italy, I tasted risottos, homemade bread, visited olive farms, gorged myself on homemade pasta, and I even had a four-course meal prepared by the well-known chef Maurizio Staiano of Salerno who has also worked with several Michelin Star Chefs.

Transparency matters: Italy moves against the secrecy surrounding the cost of medicines,https://msf-access.medium.com/transparency-matters-italy-moves-against-the-secrecy-surrounding-the-cost-of-medicines-4468a6e0ced6,"Sign up

Silvia Mancini, MSF Advocacy Officer
How much do medicines cost to develop? The answer to this critical question is that we don’t know. What we do know is that the lack of transparency and secrecy surrounding these costs allows pharmaceutical companies to charge just about any price they want for their drugs. Now Italy has taken a pioneering step in requiring more transparency from the industry.
Currently pharmaceutical corporations are not required to disclose their research and development (R&D) costs, how much public money they receive to help develop medicines, or what prices they charge in different countries.
This means they can — and do — charge sky-high prices and make huge private profits off the back of public investments. The pharmaceutical industry justifies high drug prices by claiming the need to recoup the high costs they invest in R&D. However, they never publicly reveal those figures, preferring to keep us all in the dark about the actual costs involved. Consequently, countries and health systems have to negotiate ‘blind’ with companies while trying to secure an affordable price for medicines to treat their populations.
The last few years have seen escalating drug prices create increasingly global barriers for access to medicines — these price barriers are not limited anymore to people living in developing countries. Cancer drugs, hepatitis C drugs, insulin — sky-high prices for all of the above have created real life and death challenges for people and health systems in rich countries, too. Health systems are buckling under the prices of new medicines everywhere. The public is not getting its money’s worth and pharma has been getting rich at our expense as taxpayers.
Which is why — after some pretty drawn-out and contentious negotiations — there was a cause for celebration at the World Health Assembly back in 2019, when Member States finally adopted a resolution to demand more transparency from pharma over how they price their drugs.
Italy was at the forefront of that initiative in 2019 and today is taking a further important step forward to redress the power imbalance between pharma companies and the public, and require more transparency from an industry that deliberately cloaks itself in secrecy.
August saw the formal approval of a decree from Italy’s regulatory medicines agency (AIFA) that asks pharmaceutical corporations, before any major drugs purchase, to provide the agency with specific information about the company’s R&D costs, as well as the commercial conditions under which the same product is sold in other countries — i.e. the prices the company is charging elsewhere.
The ‘Pricing and Reimbursement’ decree promises to disrupt a system which has allowed for far too long pharmaceutical corporations to impose exorbitant prices on governments for their innovative products, which are more often than not disconnected from actual R&D costs and funded with taxpayers’ money.
Let’s take a closer look at the decree — it requires corporations;
→to demonstrate the ‘added therapeutic value’ of each drug under negotiation — meaning corporations that want to bring a medicine onto the Italian market at higher prices than those of existing treatments, will now have to demonstrate that the new medicine also has increased therapeutic efficacy.
→ to disclose the price at which the drug is sold in other countries — until now, the information about prices in other countries has been ‘protected’ by confidentiality clauses.
→to make public disclosure of the subsidies and public funds received by the corporation towards the R&D costs, as well as disclosure of the overall R&D costs.
→to reveal the status of patents that it holds on the drug.
→and — the icing on the cake — to provide the regulatory authority with annual data on profits and sales of each drug.
“A spectacular ‘win’ for public health”
It’s a spectacular ‘win’ for public health and will undoubtably strengthen the negotiating position of AIFA with pharmaceutical corporations. However, we now need to see the principles on paper turned in to reality.
The task now for AIFA is to define clear means and guidelines for the implementation of the decree. For example, what steps are taken if the corporation does not produce the required documents? Will negotiations be blocked? If this applies for an essential and innovative drug, what consequences could it have on public health? Will AIFA keep its nerve and block negotiations on an essential and innovative drug, given the potential public health consequences of keeping it off the market? And who will verify the reliability of the documents produced by the corporations?
Who will follow in Italy’s footsteps?
There’s a road ahead to travel of course, but the publication of this decree is indeed a pioneering first step. And where Italy has acted, civil society groups elsewhere are now looking on closely, hoping this might encourage other governments to follow suit.
And in a time of COVID-19, there’s no more critical moment to ensure transparency of the costs of drug and vaccine development. Billions of dollars of public investment have already been poured into the race for new vaccines and treatment. We need corporations to come clean on prices and costs, and as well to share clinical data so that fair prices can be set that ensure affordability for everyone — both people in our own projects and others too in need — and that pharma doesn’t use the pandemic as another opportunity to line its pockets. Transparency matters.

Since I was a kid, I always had a strong drive to go abroad. English fascinated me as a language, and, being born in a small village in the mountains, I’ve always been eager to know what the larger world has to offer. During my studies, I had the opportunity to travel to Scotland, and learn a few facts about the business world abroad. Everything sounded more honest, open and direct than Italy, good points for me.
The choice of going abroad again to complete my education was then easy. Rotterdam was a natural choice, one of the best M.Sc.s in finance in Europe. That brought together me and Mr. Valentini and ended up with us starting Equidam.
Even before Equidam, we shared a passion for private companies. I think it probably stems out of the fact that they have larger opportunities to grow, they are more flexible and more responsive to market needs. We also shared an assumption. The assumption is that finance is under-utilised by private companies. We thought, and still do, that by knowing more about finance and having the right tools, private companies around the world can grow faster, bring their innovation to market in a better way and finally help millions of people sooner.
It was this drive and shared assumption that brought us to start Equidam. Through our little consulting days, valuation came up more and more as a topic with large disparities of knowledge between parties. Entrepreneurs and founders are not used to the valuation discussion as much as investors are. They can end up leaving money on the table or
not close a deal at all because of this miscommunication and information asymmetry. We thought (and still do!) that we could solve that. And that is how Equidam started.
Through the years we grew Equidam trying to help as many founders as possible, and I’m extremely proud of our results!
And it is on this mission, that today we launched the Italian language. After Dutch, German, and French, Italian was a natural addition. Valuation is a though topic and a though negotiation. If we want to provide companies with the best tools, these tools have to speak the language of the discussion. This increases trust, reliability and simplicity.
So why does Italian come so late, after all we are both Italian right? wasn’t it a natural choice to have Italian as first foreign language?
Yes, it might have been, but something interesting has happened. To my surprise, the Italian companies and founders demonstrated a very good English proficiency! This, coupled with a larger number of customer requests for translations in German, French etc made us change our priorities. This couldn’t go on for too long though. The Italian startup scene is happening now, and we hope to be part of it as much as possible. Lately, there’s been talk of increasing number of VC funds, angel investment clubs, accelerators and most importantly startups emerging all over Italy. Italian startups raised roughly €100 million for 2015 alone and Italian’s equity crowdfunding law was one of the first ones to come out, and still a solid base for other regulations around the world.
As a startup that is focused on helping other startups all over the world, we have been on the lookout for new developments in the global
startup scene.From the tech unicorns in the Silicon Valley to the European startup hubs such as London, Paris and Berlin, to the Israeli tech scene, we have been witnessing the boom of unicorns and smaller companies going public.We wish nothing but the utmost success to the Italian hub, and with the addition of Italian to our languages, we’ll strive even more to make it happen!
P.S. Un grazie enorme va rivolto agli utenti italiani che ci hanno aiutato ad adattare la piattaforma e finalizzarla in questi ultimi mesi, grandissimi!

I am a Finnish software developer who recently moved to Frascati, Italy. This is the fourth episode in a series of posts where I write about my experiences in living in my new home country.
The observations are written by someone who has lived most of his life in the Northern Europe: first around 30 years in Finland and then some years in the Netherlands.
At the time of writing I’ve been living in Italy for 11 months. It’s time to look back, and see how it has been so far.
I’m working from home in a fully remote setup. My team mates are in the Netherlands, and my client project has people working all over Europe and some outside the continent. I try to go see my team mates and my friends in the Netherlands on a regular basis. Typically this has been about once every two-three months, which is a good cadence for me.
I don’t mind the remote work. During the covid-pandemic I got used to it. But I do notice that it would be nice to have the flexibility to go to the office more often and to see my colleagues and team mates face-to-face without too much preparation. I see them on calls every day obviously, but it’s not the same thing. During the calls or pair-programming sessions the communication is very much focused on work. You lose all the casual interactions and conversations around a coffee machine, which has an impact on the relationships, the feeling of empathy and closeness. Then again, none of this is coming to me as a surprise. I was expecting that working remotely would have this kind of an effect.
However, I did not expect that time has become a really valuable and scarce resource to me. I need to plan carefully where and how I want to invest my time in. Because I’m working remotely and I don’t have the normal community of colleagues around me, my social life has taken a big hit. After all, for an expat the office is an easy place to meet people and to make friends with a similar mindset. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a Finn so I enjoy spending time on my own in silence and isolation, and I don’t need too many people around me. But even a Finn sometimes needs someone else to share the silence with. And it’s healthy if that other person is not always the same as your partner.
So I need to find new friends. But that takes time, commitment and requires extra effort. And time away from Italy, like if I’m going to the Netherlands or Finland for example, is time away from making new connections in Italy. So it’s a difficult balancing act. And especially weekends are extremely precious. You need to make them count.
When I was living in the Netherlands, I had two countries that required my presence: Finland and the Netherlands. Now there are three. And I love visiting each of them and spending time with the people that are important to me. But travelling takes precious time and it’s not only that. It’s also time away from the place that is your home, your safe place with all your things, routines, gadgets, and your own bed. And being away from home too much and too often can be really tiring. Maybe I’m getting old, but I like my routines and my safe place.
I’ve been studying Italian for a few years. After moving here there has been a huge leap of progress in learning the language. I’m able to follow conversations and understand pretty much everything, given that the people do not speak in a dialect, which makes understanding sometimes very difficult in the area around Rome. I once went to have a haircut in Frascati and the guys were speaking in such a heavy dialect that I understood nothing about what they were saying. It adds another layer of difficulty.
Also, I can follow TV series with Italian subtitles without any issues. Noticing these kinds of small things gives me motivation. Speaking, on the other hand, is still difficult, and I know that the problem is mostly in my head. I should just start speaking more but there is some kind of a mental block. It does get easier with time.
Anyway, I like the fact that in Italy you need to know the language in order to survive. The level of English (or even Finnish) isn’t high so you have no other choice. And learning the language is a key factor in integrating with the local culture and society. In general, the Italians appreciate the effort that I’m making in speaking the language. It can be really awkward and exhausting, but at the same time it’s a great learning experience.
And the people are genuinely helpful and warm. They might stop you in the street, have a quick chat, and tell you how nice you look. Or they might ask what you have been eating to be so tall. It’s a bit of a culture shock for a cold Finn from the far north but I like it.
I came to Italy expecting to find good weather, amazing food and wine, and beautiful landscapes filled with endless stories in history. I know that these are probably the most stereotypical things anyone would list about Italy. My apologies, it’s my lack of imagination. But that’s what I was looking for, and I’m happy to say that for the most part my expectations were met.
The weather has been very good. During the winter the coldest period lasted about three weeks. In Finland we would describe the winter in Lazio as “long October”. We barely had to turn on the heating in our apartment. Despite some anomalies in April and May, the sun has been shining and the temperatures have been steadily rising. In fact, at the time of writing there is a heat wave in Italy with temperatures climbing above 40 degrees. Frascati typically has a few degrees less than Rome, and the town is located on a hill so there is a bit more ventilation here. And luckily, our apartment is equipped with air-conditioning. Otherwise, this poor northern boy would be already cooked.
The food and the wine… Well, let’s say the Italians know what they are doing. The food is amazing and the wine is delicious and in abundance. Eating out in a restaurant is affordable. During the week I try to limit myself from eating out, but on a weekend I allow myself to relax and eat all the carbonara available. They recently opened a summer street market next to our apartment, and they have a stand selling panini con la porchetta. It’s cheap, good, and it’s dangerously close.
I am a bit surprised about the prices in the supermarket though. It’s quite expensive, and I don’t notice a big difference compared to the prices in the Netherlands or Finland for example. But the quality of the products is really high.
I’m very satisfied with the amount of nature, the beautiful landscapes, and the hiking possibilities available in Lazio. I love the fact that I can easily go hiking on a lake or on top of a mountain, and just casually pass an ancient Roman amphitheatre or an aqueduct. Il Parco Regionale dei Castelli Romani next to Frascati has enough trails to keep you busy for a long time. I’ve been also joining some guided hikes, and I’ve found that it’s a good way to explore new places and to meet new people in my new home country.
Life is a balance of pros and cons, and life in Italy is no exception. I can make exaggerated jokes about the problems I’ve had, but in all honesty I haven’t had any major issues.
When moving here I was expecting the bureaucracy to cause me terrible headaches. And yes, there have been some challenges, but mostly things have been resolved and there haven’t been any blocking obstacles. You need a bit of perseverance, a healthy level of pessimism, luck, and good connections. I guess having an Italian partner is also a gateway to success (in life in general). My tessera sanitaria is still lost in a limbo but at least I have a carta di identità. And I haven’t filed my taxes yet for last year. I expect this to be another fun adventure.
If you’ve read my previous posts, you already know that I was a bit shocked about the traffic in Rome. Now I’m already somewhat used to it, but I still try to avoid driving a car in the city center. If you’re in need of excitement and adrenaline, there are better ways to get them.
But I’m happy to say that my plan of acquiring a scooter worked wonderfully! Well, not wonderfully. I placed the order in December but finally got the scooter in May after some major delivery issues. However, since then it has been the solution to all of my problems! I’m fully autonomous. I can get to Rome easily, and without wasting time in looking for a parking spot. Driving a scooter in Rome is more fun and way less stressful than driving a car. Plus passing the beautifully lighted Colosseum in the evening with a scooter is pretty damn nice.
Moving to a new country is not easy. And moving to a new country, which is culturally and climatically very different from what you’ve used to, is even harder. You’re pulled out of your comfort zone and placed in an environment where everything is new. And it’s even warm. You need to set up all of your routines from the ground up. It is overwhelming and exhausting.
Personally, I learnt that you need to be patient, give yourself time, and celebrate every small achievement. You start from the basics, small things, and then gradually increase the difficulty level. After each achievement you can reward yourself with a glass of wine. For me this meant going through the following list in increasing level of difficulty:
Working through tasks in this manner creates a positive feedback loop, makes you more comfortable in using the language, and slowly builds up your confidence. You get an idea how things work and you are able to build a routine for yourself.
After 11 months of living here I have my routine pretty much set up. Italy feels like a home.
Really the only bigger struggle I have is finding my group of people to spend time with. It’s a solvable problem but might take some time. And what is life without a bit of challenge after all. Like my friend in Finland says “Ei tänne helppoo oo tultu hakeen” which roughly translates to “We‘re not here because it’s easy”.
I’ve been attending some expat events and I’ve found them a good place to make connections. There is a risk in ending up in an expat bubble, but right now I feel that I’d like to meet people who are in a similar situation and who can relate to how it is living in a foreign country.
Obviously, I continue learning Italian, but it might take a lifetime until I can speak fluently and express myself in the same manner as I’m currently able to do in Finnish or in English. But I like the language and I appreciate the challenge.
I’m actually really happy for the life and the quality of life that I have. I would say that the pros outweigh the cons easily. I guess I might be still in the honeymoon period of living in another country but I might as well enjoy it to the fullest.

As an Italian immigrant who has lived in an at first family-imposed and now self-imposed exile for over eighty percent of his life, I have gotten used to experiencing Italy as a tourist. On many occasions, I have found myself on holiday enjoying la dolce vita and yearning for more of Italy in my life only to then be reminded that il bel paese is much more bello to visit than to live in.
There are many stark reminders that the Italy we visit — even as Italians — is not the Italy that Italians reside in. There are the luxury five-star spa retreats on Capri and Ischia and there are the violent neighborhoods a short ferry ride away in Secondigliano. There are the Belmond collection hotels in the middle of the picturesque Colli Sennesi and then there are the small decadent towns where other Tuscans live. To experience this contrast, one just needs to veer slightly off the beaten path.
In April, I accompanied my mother from our family home in San Gimignano to visit a bookstore in Colle Val D’Elsa. The so-called…

The Sicilian town of Taormina will be the 5th Italian city to host the G7 since it was first formed in 1975 — then called G6 as Canada officially joined the following year, in 1976.
The first time the G7 leaders met in Italy was in 1980 for the 6th G7 summit, the first chaired by the Italian government. They met again in Venice in 1987 for the 13th summit.
After two summits in Venice, in 1994 the 20th G7 took place in Naples, in the Campania region of Italy. Genoa, in the Liguria region, followed in 2001 for the 27th meeting of the then-G8. The Genoa summit, in fact, also included Russia, which became an official full member in 1998 — Russia’s membership however was cancelled in 2014 under the Crimea crisis.
In 2009, the Italian government organized the 35th summit of the then-G8 in the city of L’Aquila. The meeting was originally planned in La Maddalena, Sardinia, but moved to L’Aquila to show support to the city and the region after the terrible earthquake that hit the area on April 6, 2009.
The G8 in l’Aquila was the first summit attended by US President Barack Obama who assumed office earlier that year, on January 20, 2009.
As announced earlier this month by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, the 43rd summit of the G7, will take place in Taormina, Sicily, on May 26–27, 2017.

Figuring out the right visa to move to Italy can be overwhelming if you’re doing it alone, and if you make the wrong call, you could end up losing money and staying stuck in your home country.
That’s what’s happening to some people who are being told to apply for the Elective Residency visa. If an immigration attorney is encouraging you to apply for this visa and you’re not yet retired, read on.
The Elective Residency visa is a long-term visa for people who do not intend to work once they arrive in Italy. Typically these individuals are retired or generate passive income from sources like capital gains, dividends, retirement pensions, royalties, or rental property.
While this is ideal for someone who is retired, there are immigration attorneys who are encouraging people who still work (perhaps freelance) to apply for this visa…and they’re being denied.
Some of these attorneys ignore clients when they tell them that they will continue to work once they live in Italy. They focus on the bare requirement (€31k a year in passive income sources) and don’t address what will happen once the individual arrives in Italy and is…

For people living in Italy on a residenza elettiva (elective residence) visa, the cost to opt in to the national health service has more than doubled. A new law was enacted at the end of 2023 that established a minimum cost of €2,000 and a maximum of €2,700 for each person. Prior to this, costs varied wildly region to region, but in general it was about €2,200 for both my wife and I per year based on a formula applied to gross income.
After a lot of back and forth, we got the final calculation confirmed and the combined cost for both my wife and I will now be €4,000 for a year, which translates to about $180 per month for each of us.
The diagnostic and preventive exams provided by Medicare B in the U.S. appear to be better in most respects compared to what we will get in Italy. I guess the health care here is adequate, but it certainly isn’t a screaming bargain with top notch service. As an overview of the basic coverage, the Italian national health service pays for hospital stays, ambulance service, and visits to the emergency room. About once a year the doctor prescribes extensive routine blood and urine panels and the lab work is fast. This costs…

“Yes, I think I have found the house!” I announced enthusiastically to my children and partner. None of us could have predicted how that casual idea of finding a second home would unfold and transform our lives.
At the time, I was at a crossroads. After selling my house, I couldn’t see a clear way forward in my home country. The housing market had become wildly expensive, and renting was nearly impossible without a steady employment contract. Investing in a property felt practical, so I decided to look for a second home — a place to wait out the unpredictable market. My three children were fully aware of my plans and shared in the excitement. After all, the idea of a holiday house in Spain or Italy sounded idyllic to everyone.
The house I found fit comfortably within the “second home” budget. It wasn’t a larger investment that nudged me toward a permanent move — it simply felt right. Honestly, I had never considered leaving the Netherlands before. Even moving to Peru, where my partner lives, had never seriously crossed my mind. But something shifted for me during the COVID-19 years; the Netherlands no longer felt the same.
Most people who move abroad have a clear reason: to study, pursue a job, start a dream business like a B&B, or retire in a new place. None of those reasons applied to me. I just felt an inner “yes” — a pull to go and experience something new.
Of course, I discussed it with my children, who were 19, 20, and 23 years old at the time. The two youngest had just returned from five-month solo trips to Asia, and my eldest had been living in the UK for five years. Their adventures abroad had made them supportive and enthusiastic about my move. But agreeing with the idea and facing the reality of their mother emigrating are two very different things.
Although my decision was guided by intuition, there was also a practical push. In the Netherlands, it’s not possible to live without a registered address. Spending between €1,500 and €2,500 a month on rent felt unsustainable, and moving in with my mother wasn’t a viable long-term solution. After six months of using her address as a temporary registration, I needed something permanent. The house in Italy became that solution. Once I made the decision, the next steps fell into place: moving my belongings out of storage, closing my business and tax number, and eventually selling my beloved old Volvo. (One Europe doesn’t feel very united when you’re faced with the bureaucracy of importing a car or changing a driver’s license!)
Even our dog, Sarah, became part of the plans. My ex-husband and I shared her care, as neither of us could manage full-time responsibility. Sarah traveled with me back and forth between countries. Although the 13-hour drive wasn’t her favorite, she loved her new life in Italy. Tragically, she passed away three months ago and now rests beneath the cherry tree in the garden. I still feel her presence watching over me and the house.
When my partner visited Italy to see the house, he wasn’t thrilled at first. Trading his favorite city, Amsterdam, for life in the middle of nowhere was not what he had envisioned. However, after a rocky start, he’s grown to love it. Working on the land, enjoying aperitivi at the local bar, meeting new friends, and exploring new places have gradually won him over.
And my children? It’s been a significant change for them. Although they were already living independently, my move nudged them further into self-reliance. There’s no longer a “home” to return to for a casual evening or a mother nearby when they’re feeling unwell. Visits are planned now. Yet, they love visiting Italy, and I treasure seeing them every six to eight weeks. They often bring friends, and we make the most of our time together, relaxing and appreciating the simple joys.
The dynamic of family life raises an interesting question: Where should we draw the line between living for others and choosing a path for ourselves? Was it selfish of me to move? Perhaps. But I believe it was a healthy kind of selfishness. In modern society, we often place enormous expectations on each other for care and support, yet these aren’t always balanced or reciprocated. For years, I shaped my life around my children, blending work and caregiving seamlessly. Now, it feels like the right time to embrace a new phase.
And what about caring for our parents? Do we adjust our lives for them, or do they move in with us? In an ideal world, family-based communities would allow for a natural exchange of care — elders helping with the little ones, and younger generations supporting the elderly when the time comes. But in today’s Western society, that’s not always our reality. We’re often left juggling guilt and judgment when making choices for ourselves.
In my book The Ripple Effect: Know How Powerful You Are, I explore how our struggles to grow into emotionally responsible, independent adults can create friction in families. These dynamics are complex and deeply personal. I don’t claim to have the perfect answer, but I’ve made peace with my decisions. Whether I stayed in the Netherlands or moved to Italy, there would have been positive and negative consequences for everyone involved.
I’m incredibly proud of how my children have embraced my choices, and I’m grateful for the new experiences we share here in Italy. Right now, I’m preparing the house for a lively New Year’s gathering with my two youngest and their friends. The house will be full, and I couldn’t be happier.
Follow this blog for weekly updates, surprises, and stories as I navigate the joys and challenges of building a family home and business sanctuary in Italy. There’s so much more to come!

Italy for me is like a travel magnet. Whenever I feel like going to a country with beautiful weather, tasty food, and friendly people, Italy pops up in my brain.
I always take a plane to fly From either Frankfurt or Nüremberg to Rome or Neapol, but this time around I wanted to explore Italy’s countryside. And what better way to do it if not driving from Rome through Tuscany with a red Fiat 500? 😂 It is a cute little Italian car, but look how little space there is in the back seat. Hardly enough space for my legs.
Driving through Italy is incredibly cool. The views are unforgettable.
The small cities in Tuscany are charming.

When I am in Italy, I often become an unofficial tour guide for friends who visit. Modena, where my family originated, is nicely centrally located between Milan, Venice, Florence, and all the touristy northern cities. If they want to go to Rome or Naples, it’s a bit more of a trip and involves staying in a hotel.
I am not a fan of big cities. Modena, at a bit under 200,000, is the right size for me. But friends insist that they need to see the more famous places. We head out to spend a frantic day dashing from one site to another, and then we are grateful to get back to Modena, where everything moves at a more relaxed pace.
In Rome, there is little chance for peace. Crowds abound, and I spend my time on the Metro trying not to be pickpocketed. Eventually, my friends want to go see the Sistine Chapel. That’s about the time I hit the wall with the hordes. My friends don’t realise that the massive crowds at the Vatican will also bring them to the breaking point, but this is their vacation, so I point out the tour bus that will take them directly there, take care of tickets, and provide an English-speaking…

People usually like Italy for its rich culture, stunning landscapes, and delicious cuisine, but the most precious are the people that live in this beautiful country. They can impart valuable lessons about living a healthier and more fulfilling life. Drawing inspiration from the Italian way of life, I have discovered some powerful lessons that have significantly improved my well-being. These lessons are rooted in my personal journey of moving from Ukraine to Italy and embracing a new lifestyle. Born in Ukraine, I embarked on a life-changing adventure when I moved to Italy at 19 to pursue my studies at the university. It was a whole new world that challenged me. Sometimes I cried thinking of my life at home and my friends. However, this new world was filled with unfamiliar habits and customs that intrigued me.
Over the past 10 years of residing in Italy, I have experienced a remarkable transformation. New habits I’ve learned and integrated into my daily routine improved my physical well-being and brought me a sense of contentment. Writing these words, I think of the transformative power of cultural experiences and the profound impact they can have on our well-being.

My wife and I traveled around Italy in late April and early May this year.
It was my first time in Italy, and we tried to find a balance between doing too much and too little: We wanted to visit multiple regions and see major highlights of the country, while also not feeling like we were in too much of a rush from place to place. Ultimately, we spent three nights in Rome, two in Naples, two in Salerno, three in Bologna, two in La Spezia, and a final night back in Rome.
I’m sure many travelers would still find this itinerary too rushed, and would judge that we didn’t give the cities and regions we visited all the time they deserved. On the other hand, I know plenty of travel itineraries that squeeze more places into a trip than we did, or do just as much as we did in a shorter amount of time. I think we struck a good balance, especially for my first time in the country. Whenever we get the chance to go back to Italy, I expect we will select only one or two regions to explore, and will spend much more time there.
After taking this tour of Italy, there are two places we visited that I’d really like to highlight — Salerno and La Spezia.
Salerno and La Spezia are over 300 miles apart, in very different regions of Italy. Salerno is in Campagnia, in southern Italy, while La Spezia is in Liguria, in northern Italy. Nonetheless, they are incredibly similar cities, and they are similarly overlooked in travel blogs, videos, and guidebooks. Salerno and La Spezia were, in fact, the two places I most enjoyed spending time on our trip. I think they are unjustly overlooked.
Salerno and La Spezia are smaller-sized Italian cities, with populations of 132,000 and 92,000 people, respectively, making them #30 and #53 in this list of Italy’s largest cities. While Salerno is southern and La Spezia northern, they are both port cities on Italy’s west coast, Salerno on the Tyrrhenian Sea and La Spezia on the Ligurian Sea. (Both seas are smaller parts of the Mediterranean, of course.)
The cities have some remarkable similarities in their orientation and amenities: Both face largely southward toward the sea. Both have extensive pedestrianized or mostly-pedestrianized streets offering a great variety of shopping and dining that caters to locals and visitors alike. Both even have historic castles overlooking the cities.
But let’s cut to the chase: The reason that Salerno and La Spezia get overlooked is because travel writers and visitors generally treat these cities only as jumping-off points for more famous coastal areas, not as destinations in their own right. If Salerno gets mentioned at all in travel guides, it is only as a place to get transportation to the Amalfi Coast. When La Spezia gets mentioned, it’s only because it’s the primary city used to access the Cinque Terre.
Naturally, these are the original reasons why my wife and I spent two nights in Salerno and two nights in La Spezia in the first place. We knew the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre were renowned destinations, but we also wanted to save money and trouble by not staying in one of the towns of the Amalfi Coast or Cinque Terre themselves, so we planned to stay in the nearby hub cities instead.
As it turned out, we loved the hub cities more than the world-famous destination areas.
Now, the purpose of this article is not to disparage the Amalfi Coast or Cinque Terre. We appreciated how beautiful the mountainous coastal landscapes of these areas were, and the picturesque little towns built along them. However, we were also disappointed by how crowded these areas were, which definitely lessened our experience.
I understand that early May is certainly not the “low season” or even a “shoulder season” for tourism in Italy. The weather is great, and plenty of people clearly had the same idea we did that spring is a perfect time to visit. But, given what these areas were like in early May, I found it difficult to imagine how crowded the boats, buses, and trains traveling to the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre would be in June and July — not to mention the hotels, restaurants, and streets of the towns themselves.
By contrast, Salerno and La Spezia did not have such problems with crowding. And — despite being paid so little attention in guidebooks — it wasn’t for lack of people. There were plenty of tourists passing through Salerno and La Spezia — especially La Spezia. Both are cruise ship ports: There was at least one smaller cruise ship in Salerno while we were there, and two larger ships were in port the day we left La Spezia.
The key to the issue isn’t the number of people, but the capacity communities have to accommodate those people. The famous towns of the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre are quite small: The largest towns on the Amalfi Coast, Maiori and Amalfi, have just over 5,000 residents each. The five towns of the Cinque Terre, meanwhile, have populations ranging from around 150 to little over 1,500. Bear in mind that my own town of Ketchikan, Alaska often seems overwhelmed by visitors, but Ketchikan has a summer population of around 15,000—three times larger than the largest town on the Amalfi Coast, and ten times larger than the largest of the Cinque Terre.
Towns and villages this small have narrow streets and limited amenities, even when tourism drives demand for such amenities sky-high. The very mountainous landscapes that make these communities so beautiful and famous limit the amount of space available for tourists to fill.
Salerno and La Spezia, meanwhile, have plenty of space. They are, after all, cities that already have populations of around 100,000 people each. A few hundred visitors arriving at once can make a town like Amalfi or Monterosso al Mare feel swamped, but a few thousand visitors coming off a cruise ship can be fully accommodated in Salerno and La Spezia.
Tourism is not the raison d’être of Salerno or La Spezia. While they both have cruise ship docks, they also both have industrial shipping ports, and La Spezia has a major naval base. The cities exist as sizeable, thriving communities regardless of whether foreign visitors know about them or not. I appreciate that.
That also means that, when you walk the streets of Salerno and La Spezia, or enter a restaurant, grocery store, or shop, there is no immediate assumption that you are a tourist (unless you make it really obvious, I suppose). During most of the time my wife and I spent in these cities, we were mostly among Italians. The major exception was the day we left La Spezia, when two cruise ships had arrived in port and major numbers of Germans, Americans, and others streamed into the pedestrian areas. Even then, however, there were still plenty of locals going to the same restaurants and walking the same streets.
Even at Arechi Castle above Salerno, where all the other visitors at the time I was there were foreign (Dutch and Spanish, as far as I could tell), it seemed the castle was still in large part geared toward welcoming locals and other Italians. Some of the displays in the castle museum were not translated into English, and there were advertisements for events clearly meant for locals.
My point in writing this article is not to say that travelers should skip the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre entirely and spend all their time in Salerno and La Spezia instead. The Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre are unique and beautiful areas, rightly celebrated by many. However, would-be visitors should be well aware that these areas will be crowded any time outside of the off season, and eating, sleeping, and shopping there will be noticeably more expensive than elsewhere.
I think the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre still deserve to be visited through day trips from Salerno and La Spezia. However, paying to stay in any of the small towns there for one or more nights may not be worth your money, trouble, or time. Like Venice, the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre may soon reach breaking points of overtourism when communities will need to place limits on how visitors travel there, or how many people can visit at a time.
In the meantime, Salerno and La Spezia should continue to have plenty of capacity for visitors for a long time to come. They are robust communities in their own right, largely independent of tourism, with strong transportation connections, and affordable food and lodging. There’s plenty of interest in both places — beaches, forest, art, architecture, and history. And, perhaps most importantly, they are authentic urban communities that give visitors plenty of opportunity to experience how many Italians really live.
Getting to Salerno or La Spezia is quite easy through the Italian train network, and most hotels or apartment rentals will be a short (mostly flat) walk away from the central train stations. Staying in a town on the Amalfi Coast or one of the towns of Cinque Terre, meanwhile, will require more transportation (a taxi, bus, or boat for the Amalfi Coast, or a boat or another train for Cinque Terre), and a lot more lugging around of luggage. Not to mention, those locations will almost certainly cost a great deal more. The apartment we stayed in in La Spezia was the largest we stayed in during our entire trip (a two-bedroom), and one of the most affordable. Our apartment in Salerno was the second most spacious, and similarly affordable.
The biggest difference between Salerno and La Spezia I can think of is their history. While both areas have been inhabited since ancient times, Salerno has been a major community for a much longer period, as the Normans who ruled southern Italy in the middle ages made it their capital. It’s incredible to think that back in 1050 A.D., Salerno was the second-largest community in Italy, more populated than Rome and only smaller than Venice. La Spezia, meanwhile, did not come to prominence as a community until the age of Italian unification in the nineteenth century, because of the naval base built there. Nonetheless, both Salerno and La Spezia have plenty of culture and charm, even if Salerno was more significant in centuries past.
If I had to pick a single favorite moment from my entire trip to Italy, it might well be exploring Castle Arechi and the surrounding forest. I met some sheep, goats, and herding dogs, spent time contemplating the history of Byzantine and Norman rule in the region, and loved looking out at gorgeous views of Salerno — a truly authentic Italian city — from numerous viewpoints.
The only reason I knew about the castle and the amazing views it offers was because of a vlog on YouTube, not made by a typical travel vlogger, but rather by a South African man living in Italy who was merely taking a day trip to the city. If I’d only paid attention to standard travel websites, I wouldn’t have realized I should go to Castle Arechi, or known much about Salerno at all.
The next time my wife and I get the chance to visit Italy, we likely won’t range across the country from south to north, but will choose one or two regions to spend more time in. We might want to revisit Salerno or La Spezia, but we likely won’t see both in the same trip.
If you’re planning your own trip to Italy, I’d encourage you to look for places a little off the beaten path. Or, find places that are on the beaten path, but don’t receive the attention and credit they deserve as communities worth visiting in their own right. That’s what I think Salerno and La Spezia are — beautiful and authentic Italian cities overlooked because of the more famous tourist destinations nearby.
Instead of just passing through, consider staying there a while!
Do you prefer to spend time in smaller towns geared toward tourists, or larger communities filled with locals? Leave a comment below with your own thoughts and travel experiences.

Nice is a great place to live, as you can reach so many European and Mediterranean destinations by low-cost plane, train, or car, in just a few hours. Italy is right next door, but the northern part is difficult to reach by train, so we rented a car to meet up with family and friends. It took 4 1/2 hours travel on the fantastic Italian autostrade (highways) to reach the northern tip of beautiful Lago d’Orta.
Lago d’Orta is sometimes called the Cinderella of the Italian lakes. It is much smaller that Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (that I have not visited yet), but it is charming and beautiful, even in the rain (we came last year in chilly wet weather) – however, not to be missed in the sunshine.
Tip nr.1: the fastest way to get a meal on the road is by stopping at an Autogrill (highway rest stops). The food is not very good, and not cheap at all. On the other hand, shopping for Italian specialties can be nice.
We rented an Airbnb in the suburbs of Omegna. This was my first Italian Airbnb. It was a bit old-fashioned and the kitchen’s only condiments were salt and pepper. There was no oil, which was unpractical, as I’d come to expect it in any Airbnb. There was also no kitchen mitt; we promptly burned a towel, which I replaced. I tried to buy a mitt, but searched in several stores, and a market, unsuccessfully !
Our first day was sunny, and I asked the group if we could go to Orta San Giulio, that I had toured in the rain last year. It was a magical day. We parked in a public lot (you pay via a machine and it’s not very expensive) and set off to see the town. First stop (after a short visit to a tiny church): Arte del Gelato on Via Olina.
The gelato is absolutely wonderful. I had Fondente (dark chocolate sorbet) and mirtilia (blackberry — I think). Others had Panna Cotta (delicious), lemon sorbet… my friend swears by mango and pistachio. Tip 2: 6 cones/cups cost €15. (June 2023)
It was Wednesday, market day. Stalls sold clothing, produce, jewelry. Just beware of the olives/antipasti stall: it was ridiculously expensive and not all that delicious.
We hopped into a ferry (€5 a person) to visit the small island in the middle of the lake. We walked all around it, through narrow winding streets and steps, with glimpses of the water. The Basilica of San Giulio was beautiful: an 11th-12th century church built on a crypt dating back to the 5th century, with the tomb of a saint. As a lapsed Catholic (technically Maronite), I still like to light candles in churches (the real kind, not the fake battery-operated ones), and here they only cost €0.30, but I had already used up my change in the aforementioned tiny church, where they were €0.50. Compare that to €2–3 in German and Swiss churches!
Much as Orta San Giulio was wonderful, the town where our Airbnb was, Omegna, begged to be discovered, too.I walked to Omegna a bit before noon, downhill all the way, on roads with very little in the way of sidewalks, and cars zooming down – after all, this is Italy.
The view of the mountains was magnificent. When I reached town, a street market was in action. It went on for so long that I turned back at one point. Housewares (kitchen tools, towels, etc.), clothing for adults and children, and much more was on display. I headed into the city proper, through narrow streets, and finally came out at the canal. At least that’s what it appears to be: I found no river on the map.There is a very tiny beach at Canottiere, a restaurant, cafe and boat rental outfit. Teens were splashing around (including those in my group).I walked further into town, on the hunt for kitchen mitts (surprisingly hard to find in supermarkets!), and realized that there was a pedestrian walk along the canal.
After leaving Omegna, we drove to visit our friends in Baragiotta. It’s a tiny village with over 100 year old buildings, some of which are crumbling. Our friends renovated theirs to create a modern upper floor loft, with a medical practice on the ground floor. Most of the rest is still under construction. In the basement, we saw very old dusty bottles.(wine?) There is also an old-fashioned, perhaps 1950s kitchen.
Last year we had the pleasure of tasting the very excellent Erbaluce wine at Costa di Sera, and we wanted to buy a box to give some to our Nice friends. Once again, we were invited to a meal of cheeses, salamis, vegetables, bread, and breadsticks, in the Rock-music themed room of our Heavy Metal fan winemaker, Alfonso Rinaldi. Thisntime, my ear had become a little more attuned to Italian, and I think I understood about 30% of what he said (and he had a lot to say, including, incredibly, that one of the world’s best songs was « Blue Spanish Eyes »!
Our stomachs full, and our crate of wine safe in the car, we went on to visit the Agroturisma Fano’s Farm Bed and Breakfast. If you can snag a room or an apartment, it’s a one stop vacation, especially if you have children. Horses, ponies, chickens, a swimming pool and a vegetable garden await!
My friend (whom I know since high school in Germany – a very long time ago) reminded me that I expressed a desire for one more thing. After several guesses, I remembered: gelato from Cafe Agarla in Romagnano. The owner gets the freshest ingredients, and if the ingredients aren’t available that day at the market, that flavor will be unavailable. I had grapefruit/ginger and pistachio. The grapefruit was excellent, the pistachio IMHO a bit boring. Fondente wasn’t available! (Ice cream for 4 people cost €8.)
It was sadly time to leave the next day (Sunday). We tried to stop for coffee at one of the seaside towns near Genoa, but everyone was out (a sunny Sunday in June, after all) and there was nowhere to park. We had our capuccino at yet another highway Autogrill, with the delicious homemade grilled zucchini-mozzarella sandwiches our friend packed for us. It was still Italian capuccino in Italy – a notch above capuccino anywhere else! (The Autogrill lady probably thought I was crazy for grinning – but she smiled back nevertheless.)

After a week exploring the Alsace in France, I drove south through Switzerland to my new home base in the Aosta Valley of Italy. Today’s drive took me across borders, through tunnels and into spectacular Alpine scenery.
Switzerland maintains its historic neutrality and is not part of the European Union. As I left France, I had to stop at the border crossing in Basel and purchase a vignette (~$40) to place on the inside my windshield. It was basically a toll for the privilege of driving on Swiss roads.
The stoic Swiss border agent took my credit card and inserted it into his portable device but it was not connecting. I mentioned (in German) something about this being a Monday and he chuckled. I considered that a major achievement.
After securing my payment and applying my vignette, I was free to hit the Swiss highways. I drove from Basel, through Bern, down to Lake Geneva. I stopped in the lakeside town of Montreux and explored its famous castle, the Château de Chillon. What an incredible sight.
The views of the castle along the shimmering lake with the snow-capped Alps towering in the distance were jaw-dropping. The views were still incredible from inside the castle as I peaked out the windows.
I also admired the modern Swiss engineering involved in the highway that curved gracefully above the lake.
As I continued my journey south, the road continued to climb. It also narrowed and devolved into a series of hairpin turns. The temperature steadily dropped and soon I was passing above the tree line through snow.
I crossed over the border from Switzerland to Italy somewhere deep below a mountain inside the Great St Bernard Tunnel. When I finally emerged back into daylight, the signs had switched from French to Italian.
It didn’t take long for the road to begin its steep descent into the Aosta Valley. The Romans conquered this region around 25 BC, building roads and bridges. Valle d’Aosta literally means “Valley of Augustus”.
I have a grand view of this ancient valley from the balcony of my Airbnb.
My proprietor, Anne-Marie, is actually Belgian and she spoke excellent English. Her property is set up perfect for me, she even included a bottle of local wine and a wedge of Aosta (pronounced “ow-oh-stuh”) cheese.
After unpacking, I stretched my legs by hiking around the neighborhood. Most of the houses clung to the side of the mountain and all enjoyed this incredible view. Even through we’re at a higher elevation, it’s warmer here than France due to the special micro-climate protected by mountains on both sides.
As I was out hiking, a farmer rumbled by on his tractor and gave me a friendly Ciao. I’m generalizing here but the Italians always seem more approachable to me, especially after I’ve spent time with the typically reserved French and Germans. I need to brush up on my Italian phrases.
After the long drive through the mountains, I’m ready to call it a day.
It should be interesting to explore this area considering it offers Roman ruins and plenty of castles plus Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn are nearby.

If you tread slowly over cobblestoned streets and walkways in Matera, Italy you can feel the very bones of its past. Take your time. Observe and appreciate that you are standing in one of the oldest functioning human habitations in the world.
It is a place of history, beauty, and people. It is the city of the Sassi, one of Italy’s heritage sites built of stone with evidence from the Paleolithic era to more recent finds.
It is rumoured that Jesus of Nazareth visited Matera although no one knows exactly where. Its pre-Roman expansion from hunter-gatherer to pastoral farming suggests a peaceful abundant existence.
Perhaps Jesus found it suited him for a time during his travels, like a much-needed time-out from constant Roman oppression. Who didn’t need that?
Most residents love to talk about Matera and its history. Once called the shame of Italy much of its oldest dwellings cut into the stone hillsides have been restored and now house restaurants and hotels.
However, as I stood looking out over the walled edges of the city into the hills…
