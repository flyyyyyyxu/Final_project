"London, just like what I imagined","Just went to London last weekend. Here are some personal experiences and suggestions

The British Museum: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The best museum I’ve ever been to. All kinds of artifacts from all over the world. You feel like you’re really close to them because many of them are unprotected. You could easily touch them (Not recommended). I saw a kid just climb onto a 3,000-year-old artifact, and I was shocked.

Tips: You don’t have to wait outside for the security check if you don’t bring any bags. Just tell them you don’t have bags, and they will let you in.

Tower Bridge: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Went there at night. It’s a lot bigger than I thought and it’s so beautiful.

Tips: Wear more clothes when you walk on the bridge. It’s very cold.

London Tower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

A historic castle, and it’s right next to the Tower Bridge. You can see some royal armour and what a castle looks like. The castle life isn’t as good as I imagined. The doors are short, and the passages are very narrow. The most interesting part is that you can see all the kings and queens’ crowns. The crown jewels are so beautiful, but no photos are allowed. Unique experience.

Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, London Eye, and Hyde Park: ⭐⭐⭐

Buckingham Palace is not open now. All you can do is take a picture. Same as Big Ben, take a picture. But they are landmarks, so you should go, just nothing there. The London Eye and Hyde Park are really not recommended. You can find sky wheels and parks like these anywhere in the world.

The National Gallery: ⭐⭐⭐

It should be 5 stars for artists, but I’m not. The paintings are great, and it feels different when you see them in person than when you see them in pictures. Also, many paintings' sizes are a lot larger than I thought. They all have the same size in the pictures. 😂 You should go if you have time.

The Natural History Museum: ⭐⭐

Only recommended if you have kids. Maybe kids like it. It’s so huge but very empty. Just like any natural history museum in the world. There’s nothing special about it.

Fish and Chips: Zero Star

Do not try it. Very expensive, 22 ₤, but it tastes worse than the cheap frozen cod from Costco, and the chips are worse than the fries from McDonald's.

Summary:

I like this city. The English accent is easier to understand than in other UK cities. Two days are enough to visit most attractions in London if you just want to take some pictures and see some famous stuff.

Public transportation is very convenient. You can use Apple Pay to go anywhere.

You can feel you’re in London when you see people wearing stylish clothes. It was around 10 degrees, and I saw so many girls wearing shorts or skirts on the street when I felt so cold in trousers. Probably should go there when the weather is warmer.

I used ChatGPT to find the recommended museums in London, as shown in the last picture. It was good for museums and attractions but not very good for finding restaurants, which recommended pizza in London 😂

Beware of fake booking.com listings (I was scammed in London) ,"I booked a say in an apartmenr through booking.com, it was nonrefundable but it was a decent price for Mayfair, London (2000£ for 4 nights) and looked very nice. I was booking quite last minute so I booked it without much thought as I have only had positive experiences with booking apartments. 

The day before my check in I received a message that I have to PayPal the host 1500£ as a safety deposit to receive the address - this seemed very sketchy. Then I found the photos listed again but this time as a different apartment and different location - I knew I was being scammed!

I called the customer support and that was the worst experience ever because after speaking to 3 different people and a manager, I was told to pay the PayPal fee outside of booking as they believe it is real and as I agreed to the property policy by booking with this host! I informed them about the duplicate listings and if they can guarantee the paypal money if I don’t receive the address, they said they can’t guarantee that! Booking told me that if I don’t PayPal the money to the host I won’t even get a refund form booking. 

So I paid the fee and hoped to receive the address, guess what, I didn’t get anything despite repeatedly reaching out to the host. 

I called my local booking support not their international one (never call the international support they are incompetent), my local support said these scams happen every day now and they called the host. The customer support guy said the scammer was screaming at them and was hysterical and rude for being exposed. I received my PayPal and booking money but stayed in the center of London without a place to stay.

I love staying at apartments but with booking and airbnb scams happening every day, I have to recommend everyone to stay in hotels until booking.com manages to put better anti-scam policies into place. I was lucky my local support helped me, the international support basically just kept repeating - “no worries mam we think the listing is real, we can’t help you” 

Another scam I found is a villa in st tropez, which after reverse image searching on google is a famous villa in Corsica! This was 2000€ per night and after filling out multiple reports it is still online.

I decided that I'm going to walk from London to Glasgow,"Hello everybody!


Quick disclaimer, I (F/22) know how this sounds in the current situation, but I'll make sure to keep my distance to other people, and have gloves + face coverings with me at all times!


A bit of background before I go into details: I lost my job a few months ago. I got increasingly anxious, and since I used to be clinically depressed for +7 years of my life, I got super worried about ending up like that again. I have been living without any meds since 4 years, and I really don't want to fall back into that black hole in which I used to live.

As I lost my job (I think that was by the end of march), I wanted to focus more on my writing (I want to be able to live as a writer) but somehow the stress caused me to procrastinate more than ever.
I ended up in a new office job instead (it pays the bills and everything, but it also leaves me very very anxious and also unsatisfied) and I beat myself up for it.


Today as I woke up, I had a moment of ""f*ck this shit I'm out""

I already knew that I had to take a break from all of this since a long time, and I wanted to do something dumb. Something that distracts me, and helps me to re-boot. I just can't continue to waste my life due to anxiety, because I am so so sick of it!

That's why I decided to walk from where I am right now (London) to Glasgow. I always wanted to visit Glasgow, but never got arround, which made me sad when I was thinking about it today.

It will take an est. 6 days, (ETA: Just the walking, not the journey altogether) and during this time I will also take a few breaks to sit down and focus completely on my writing. I also think, that I might do some live blogging on my Insta, just to ""talk"" to someone, because I feel like otherwise it might be a bit lonely.

I know this is stupid, I know there might be better ways to deal with my issues, and I know that this short escape won't help me in the long run, but I need it!

I have never done anything like this, and wanted to ask for advice here (which is also why I posted this to begin with). Mostly, if anyone has any tips to stay safe, and where to sleep. If anyone has ever done something like this, please let me know your experience, and if I should know about anything in advance to stay safe!


If you've read all of this: Thank you so much! This ended up way longer than I intended it to be


EDIT: Yes, I do now realise that I (for now) lack the proper preparation for this journey. I'll make sure to make a few test runs and get prepared as good as I can before making my way! Thank you all for pointing it out though, otherwise I probably would have rushed into things ^^",778,222,1594627601.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/hqbcje/i_decided_that_im_going_to_walk_from_london_to/,ThrowAwayNameRandom1
Would a 2-week London -> Paris -> Rome -> Athens trip be too much?,"Some friends and I are planning on going to Europe next year and none of us have been to Europe before. We want to see as many cities as possible but don't want to be too rushed - would it be possible to properly the 4 cities listed, in that order, or are they too intense/far apart? Would other cities be better for a first trip to Europe?

Which is better for aimless exploring - Paris or London,"I know that when we go to London we don't really need a plan and we can just walk around to our hearts content.  Generally we pick a place to go and see and then just aimlessly wander from there.  It works well for us and rarely disappoints. We've been doing it for years.  When we go to Paris though - not so much.  It doesn't seem to have the walkability of London and the endless curious nooks and crannys.  I'd like to go back to Paris before school starts up for the kids (12yrs old) but I'm wondering how to find those fun, off the beaten track, places we like so much where the crowds are smaller and the locals find it appealing.  Any suggestions?",106,115,1724100477.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ewcq7r/which_is_better_for_aimless_exploring_paris_or/,Mach-082
Does nothing happen if you smoke in an airplane bathroom?,"I was on a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok to London yesterday and a ~~stoner~~ junkie went into the bathroom and lit a cigarette. The smoke alarm went off, there was literal smoke coming out of the door and an attendant banging on the door for 5 minutes telling him you can't smoke and to get out. 

Once he got out, I thought the police might arrest him once we land in London. But nothing at all, not even a slap on the wrist. We followed him from the plane to passport control to baggage claim. No one even pulled him aside. Are the warnings all just for show? I was so confused.

Edit: Changed stoner to junkie after some helpful comments. Sorry stoners :)

Final Edit: For those wondering about why I called him a junkie - we asked his mate who was escorting him for his next bathroom trip if the guy was OK and why he'd do something like that. He said ""he's on his way down, if you know what I mean"". ",1867,285,1746435988.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kf7299/does_nothing_happen_if_you_smoke_in_an_airplane/,BilluOnline
What are the best neighborhoods in London for wandering around randomly?,"One of my favorite ways to learn about a city is to just wander around random neighborhoods and go wherever the mood takes me.

"Where should my husband and I go for $10,000?","For my 10th work anniversary, my company gifted me $10,000 for a 1 week trip to anywhere in the world (give or take a few days would be fine). We’re having trouble selecting somewhere as there are so many options, so I want to consider recommendations based on a few details:

- We’re in our early 30’s, traveling just the two of us (my husband and I) 
- we recently spent 2 weeks in Italy/ a could days in London for our honeymoon. We spent a lot of the trip traveling around and sight seeing, so I’d like something maybe a bit more relaxing ( probably a good blend of relaxing and sight seeing/activities so we’re not bored)
- I think we’ll probably be going on the trip in December 
- we live in Florida 
- some places we’ve discussed have been an African safari, Japan, Hawaii, Thailand, or something like Maldives or Bora Bora

I want to consider this once in a lifetime gift well and choose somewhere that make sense for the length of trip and budget, that will result in an amazing trip. Please share your recommendations with us!

Edit: wow! I’ve never really posted to Reddit before so I was not expecting so many responses! Thanks everyone for the great suggestions. We have received a lot of information and recommendations that we would have never even thought of. We are very excited and blessed to be going on this trip and I will report back when we make the final decision on where to go. Thanks again!


Update: we went to French Polynesia! We stayed in Tahiti, then Bora Bora and Taha’a. It was absolutely incredible and we are so happy with our decision! If you ever get the chance, definitely visit French Polynesian - the islands are beautiful, the food is delicious, and the people are very welcoming. Thanks all for your suggestions!

"Short trip to London, Paris, or both?","My husband and I are hoping to take a trip for our anniversary next August (2025). I have always wanted to visit London, but my husband loves Paris and wants to go there. We'd be traveling from the U.S.

We have two children who will stay with a relative, but we don't want to leave them longer than four (maybe five) nights.

Neither of us have ever been to London and I'd probably rather spend our limited time there. My husband loves Paris and wants to make it work to spend a couple of days there. His thought is we could spend a couple days in London, take the Eurostar to Paris, and then spend a couple days there.

I'm just looking for any advice or insight out there from people more familiar with one or both cities. I know both cities offer so many things and we won't be able to scratch the surface of either in such a short time. But I'm sure we can have a good time and get a glimpse of either city during a quick trip. I'm just not sure if it's better to try to make both work or just focus on one.

Americans -- don't ever change,"Americans—don't ever change.

I am writing this post from London, in the United Kingdom. I have just learned that I have become a dual citizen (complicated story), making me British-American, and my first U.S. passport is on its way.

So it got me thinking about all my previous adventures in your one-of-a-kind country, and the thing that stood out most was the sincerity behind the kindness found in each American’s heart and the spirit of persistence and determination. I have yet to meet a nation with people who are as friendly as they are hard-working, and for that reason, I hope you guys never change.

I have so many memories, moments, and experiences that I wrote down in my diary of my trips to the USA. I distinctly remember my first impressions of arriving in Boston: big houses, flags, yellow school buses, football fields, iconic stop signs, brownstone buildings, chatty waitresses, diners, Walmart, billboards, station waggons, and 7-11s. It was pure, unbridled joy. I remember thinking to myself, “This country can’t be real; it’s so motherfucking cool. Just like the movies, honestly, what a beautiful country."" I was a teenager, so naturally I didn’t have access to a car, but I had the most amazing time getting lost in Beech Forest in Cape Cod, wandering far from Provincetown. Massachusetts as a state is underrated, I think. Uber drivers being hilarious Dominicans never fails to amuse me, and the town of Newburyport has a special feeling to it, I find, even if the commuter rail schedule is unforgiving for those who miss their trains like me.

I have a million stories to tell, but I will just share some brief reflections: D.C. and Chicago are very underrated cities, both beautiful with great architecture. NYC is NYC; no need to touch upon that; it makes London look like a calm and laid-back city. LA and San Francisco epitomise that cool West Coast vibe, and the coastal towns and cities of California are heavenly. Malibu, Monterrey, Carmel-by-Sea, Santa Barbara, Santa Monica... do I need to go on?

The great state of Texas warrants its own paragraph. I met an Arsenal fan in the little town of Iola; that was an eye-opening experience. Austin is a great city with fun people, and I gave myself a “Texan sunburn” on my shoulder when I fired a shotgun for the first time in my life. Buccees is a gift from God; don’t take it for granted. The beaver nuggets and beef jerky are to die for. The little enclave of Marfa in West Texas was simply fascinating; it was such a unique part of the world in my eyes.

Utah, Colorado, and Vermont—you guys are little slices of heaven on Earth. I witnessed my first proper thunderstorm in a town called Loa in Utah. I went for a stroll at 1 a.m. in this tiny town, where everyone else was already sleeping, because I wanted to get a feel for the place. I got caught in the rain and decided to make the most of it, so I continued walking around. The thunderstorm caused a power cut for a few minutes, and then it was just me, the howl of the wind, and the crack of lighting. After a few minutes, the bright red sign of Family Dollar lit up, and I became entranced by the neon sign that illuminated the road. I don’t know why that moment has stuck with me—maybe because it was surreal being the only one awake at that hour in a town thousands of miles from home. Colorado and Vermont have to be among the most stunning places on Earth. I have no words to describe the serenity and character the small towns in these states exude. Ouray, Telluride, Breckenridge, Silverton, Stowe, Woodstock...

So I guess what I want to say is thank you for being you, don’t ever change, and don’t let anyone else tell you that the USA isn’t a great country. I believe that life's beauty lies in its messiness and unpredictability, and while the USA has flaws like every other country in the world, there is a reason so many people want to start anew in the USA—because the spirit of hard work, kindness, and authenticity shines through everyday Americans.",3848,544,1710272647.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bd6igr/americans_dont_ever_change/,chester_ming99
After leaving Europe I'm finding it hard to enjoy the US,"I spent most of the summer railing around Europe and spent time in many cities I've never been. I feel I really got into the lifestyle there. Sitting outside to eat on summer nights. Walking and taking transit everywhere. Seeing people outside everywhere partaking in the city. Enjoying the historic charm that is in abundance, feeling safe everywhere at all hours(maybe with the exception of Marseilles and parts of London), etc. 

I feel like the US in comparison is just...underwhelming. I currently live in Nashville and most of my life have lived in Los Angeles. I want to move to a new city but really don't like any city in the US enough to be excited about going there. And it seems the only places in America that might give you a slice of that European lifestyle are prohibitively expensive, like San Francisco or NYC.

I feel like most Americans cities are sprawling, bland, built around cars, terrible transit, unsafe. A few years ago I was walking through downtown Atlanta on a weekend in the afternoon and was stunned that there were no people walking other than me. It was like the city had been abandoned. I could not imagine the center of a European city being completely empty of pedestrians. There is more vibrancy in a European city of 200,000 than in an American city of 2 million. 

After the architectural splendor of Prague and Edinburgh. the Mediterranean charm of old town Nice, eating in the medieval alleyways of Croatia, I come back to America and feel kind of depressed at the landscape of strip malls, drive-thru Starbucks, urban blight, sprawling suburbs with cookie cutter houses and no sidewalks or pedestrians in sight. Maybe one little historic ""old town"" street downtown that you have to drive into and that's full of souvenir shops and chain restaurants. 

I guess I'm just ranting and experiencing post-vacation blues, but I'm missing the European lifestyle so much it hurts and I'm having difficulty adjusting to America. I liked just about every European city I visited. There are very few American cities I'd bother visiting unless I had a specific reason to go there. 

On the plus side, the variety of natural scenery in the US, particularly the western US rivals anything in Europe and maybe surpasses it. And increasingly I'd rather rent a cabin in some place like the Smoky Mountains or Sierras in California than visit the cities.",6665,1875,1665514511.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/y1h4au/after_leaving_europe_im_finding_it_hard_to_enjoy/,ReflexPoint

London - Cinema culture shock,"Hello, I just wanted to share my curious culture shock experience when traveling to London.  
And wanted to ask if this is normal or if I just had some bad luck.

I went to London for the first time for a extended weekend.  
While there, I decided that it would be nice to try the BFI IMAX and Science Museum IMAX cinemas.  
As the only other IMAX I have been to is in Czech Republic Prague.

I went to see the Dune 2 in both cinemas (yes, I don't mind watching a good movie twice two days apart :D).

Both screenings were fully booked and it was not long after the initial release, so I expected mostly people who are genuinely interested to see the picture to be the majority in the audience.

**The culture shock:**

First thing that got me was the amount of people who were coming in late, the movie has already started (after advertisements) and 10% of the seats were empty. People just casually came in 10 minutes into the movie and tried to get to the **middle seats** while **shining a mobile flashlight**. - I have never in my 15 years of movie-going in Czech Republic encountered something this inconsiderate. If you come 30 minutes late to the screening (accounting for 20 mins of advertisements), and its a fully booked IMAX screening, you will not be let in.

The same thing when going to the toilets. I rarely see somebody go to the toilet during a screening and when they do, they go completely in the dark not to disturb.  
Particularly from the middle seats in our cinemas. I don't even remember a single time a person from the middle of the row got up during the screening in the last 15 years. But here it was like every 20 minutes somebody got up, turned on their mobile flash light and demanded that everybody made way for him.

Also the amount of people rustling their popcorn buckets and packs with crisps.   
I could not concentrate on the movie for the first 30 minutes as there was constant crunching and rustling around.   
The worst thing was that they were not even trying to eat silently, just garbing a fist full of popcorn and stuffing their mouths while of course rustling while the popcorn dropped from the fist.  
\- If you have food, people usually try to eat very slowly and try to make as little noise as possible not to disturb others, here it seemed like they are making noise on purpose.

Is this normal, or did I have a very bad luck?

How are you supposed to enjoy a movie in an IMAX if everybody is acting this inconsiderate?

If its normal, why are people acting like this? 

This happened both times in both cinemas almost exactly the same issues.",153,85,1711553529.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bp4r5f/london_cinema_culture_shock/,ToothlessFuryDragon

Tips for exploring London?,"Hi! 
I’m thrilled to be visiting London for the first time with my family later this year, and I’ve been doing quite a bit of research already, but I’d love some personal tips from those who’ve been!
We’re trying to stick to a budget, so I’ve looked into a few free or low-cost attractions like the Natural History Museum, and walking around areas like Hyde Park.
For food, I’ve heard Borough Market and Camden Market are great for variety and relatively affordable eats, but I’m curious if there are other local street food spots or hidden gems that you’d recommend. We’re especially interested in trying something that feels authentic and not just touristy.

London to Paris day and half trip. Pro/con,"I guess it falls under more of a convinced me not to regret doing this.  We have a five day trip planned to London. The four of us, husband, wife, 18 and 22-year-old have never been abroad.  Looking at the itinerary we are considering going to Paris via the Euro train for a day and a half.  We would stay over one night.  The euro train cost for the four of us is $1800. On one hand that’s a good chunk of money.  On the other hand, this is an opportunity to see the Eiffel Tower and visit the Louvre.  
Our trip is for the (Dec) 25th through the 30th. Due you do some other constraints, We are looking to travel to Paris on the morning of the 28th and come back on the 29th.
I’ve always lived by the adage. There will be time to make more money, but the experience opportunities may not come again.

What city to pair with Paris? London or Amsterdam?,"My girlfriend and myself, both mid 30s, are planning a 9 day trip to Paris at the end of February/First week of March.

We do like modern/pop art so if there are museums of that nature we would enjoy that. We are def foodies, we love roaming around finding a good patio and people watching. I was thinking of 4-5 days in Paris and the rest of the time possibly in London or Amsterdam. We’ve been looking at flying into London and having 2.5 days and then taking the Eurostar into Paris.. but is it worth is for only that amount of time?

Barcelona was underwhelming,"Visited Barcelona recently for a few days as part of a larger Spain trip. I had very high hopes because of how much praise and hype Barcelona always gets. 

Honestly though…I was a little disappointed and in fact, I would probably place it as my least favourite place out of everywhere I visited in Spain (Madrid, Granada, Sevilla and San Sebastián). 

Some of the architecture is cool but I felt like there’s nothing that it offers that other major European cities don’t do better. It was smelly and kinda dirty, and I felt some weird hostile vibes as a tourist as well. The food was just decent, and none of the attractions really blew me away, other than Sagrada Familia. The public transit and walkability is *fine* but again, nothing amazing. 

I usually like to judge a place based on its own merits but while in Barcelona I couldn’t help but compare it to other major European cities I’ve been and loved, like Rome, Paris, Lisbon, London, Prague, Istanbul (kinda counts I guess) etc. and finding it a bit lacking.",1156,765,1724721587.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f24vjj/barcelona_was_underwhelming/,Wooden_Mood_3359

- I am from the US (Denver, CO).

- The soonest we'd want to go is probably the fall.  My kids get a week off in October.  But if we should try and do next summer, that would give us even more time to plan.

Edit:  I got more messages and comments overnight than I have ever gotten before!  Thank you all.  It will take me a while to sift through.  But this is why I love Reddit!  When someone needs help, you all show up!

Edit:  a lot of you have been saying to take the trip sooner.  Unfortunately, I'm currently getting chemo every 3 weeks until the end of April, which means I feel pretty crappy 2 weeks out of the month.

So I can't plan the trip until I know how I'm going to feel when my chemo is done.

I really want to hold out until October so it won't be so hot, and I'll know where I'm at as far as how I'm feeling.

March 2025 - London + Edinburgh + Paris (+ Barcelona?) 16 days. Help me solve a complex problem.,"We are going to London to see a single (special) West End show in early March. We were originally just going to go for a long weekend, but then I thought ""Why not extend the trip to go to Edinburgh?"" since we've both never been.

Then my partner said, ""I'd like to go to Paris too."" And I said ""That's ok with me.""

And then I thought, ""While we're at it, we might as well try to squeeze Barcelona in there too."" Since it's also on our wish list of places to go as well.

So now it turned into a complex problem that I'm trying to figure out lol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luckily, we are decently flexible on the number of days we can travel, probably up to 16 days. So, I'm trying to balance out the itinerary with as many spots as possible, without going overboard and making the trip too hectic. My fundamental question is, what is too much?

We've been to both London and Paris before so we probably don't need to max out the time there.

What's the optimal number of days to spend in each place? Since we've been to London and Paris before, we probably don't need to spend a full itineraries' worth of time in there. It also doesn't seem like you need to spend more than a couple of days in Edinburgh.

So far, the rough itinerary i've come up with is this:

1. Fly in: 1 Day
1. London: 4 days
1. Edinburgh: 3 days
1. Paris: 4 days
1. Barcelona? 3 days?
1. Fly out: 1 day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we do include all the locations, what is the most efficient order to visit these places? Since there are no nonstop flights to or out of Edinburgh from our home, it seems like we'll need to:

1. Fly into London
1. Take the train to Edinburgh
1. Fly from Edinburgh to Paris
1. Fly from Paris to Barcelona
1. Fly from Barcelona back home.

"Planning for a trip to London, the Netherlands and Belgium from the US; need help to put a plan together","Hey folks - A family of 4 (Dad, Mom, 18 year old and 14 year old children) plans to travel to London, the Netherlands and Belgium for about 7-8 days flying from near JFK around the end of Jun 2025. Costco travels has not been of help  as I couldn't get a hotel that accommodates all the 4 in a room apparently because one of the children is an adult. So we mean to book flights and accommodation separately on our own.

Plan is:

1. Fly from JFK/Boston to Amsterdam

2. Stay in a hotel / airbnb (to be booked in advance)

3. Make road-trips to Belgium

4. Fly out of the NL to London

5. Stay in a hotel / airbnb (to be booked in advance)

6. Fly back to the US.  
Any thoughts if flying to London first and then to the NL/Belgium be better?

Any recommendations for decent places of stay? Obviously safety is of priority. Mostly we'll be out most time of the day and return to the place of stay only to sleep in.

Traveling in London,"Hi all, I appreciate any comments or recommendations on this post. I am traveling to London in a couple weeks and am wondering about best ways to travel. Some people I have spoken with recommended riding buses when applicable. Others say the tube. Are there week long passes for the train that are a flat fee or will they only take you to certain stops? Also, do I even need tickets at all? I have seen some people post videos of them just scanning their debit card at train stations and paying that way as long as you have tap to pay. That would seem to help especially after landing at LHR as the lines for train tickets seem to always be incredibly long. Thanks again.

Need Help Choosing: London + Scotland vs. Italy + Amsterdam (July 2025 Trip),"
Hi Reddit fam! 

My husband and I are planning our summer vacation for the first half of July 2025, and we’re down to two very different but amazing options — 

London + Scotland or Italy + Amsterdam. 
We’d love your help choosing!

About us:
	•	We’re a couple in our early 30s, no kids.
	•	We’re not really into history or museums.
	•	We love exploring cities, unique experiences, gorgeous scenery, great local food, and an amazing nightlife scene.
	•	Not huge fans of over-touristy or overly chaotic places.
	•	We loved places like Paris, Nice, Bodrum, Cappadocia, Ibiza (for parties) and found Antalya and Barcelona a bit too touristy or generic.

Our biggest priorities:
	•	Weather (we want to enjoy being outside!)
	•	Crowd levels
	•	Daily vibe and energy
	•	Good food and drinks
	•	Scenery and unique experiences

⸻

Option A: London + Scotland (14 days)
	•	Day 1–3: Explore London

	•	Day 4: Day trip to Thorpe Park 

	•	Day 5: More time in London

	•	Day 6: Day trip to Bath 

	•	Day 7: Day trip to Brighton 

	•	Day 8–10: Edinburgh
	•	Day 11: Day trip to the Trossachs National Park
	•	Day 12–13: Back to London for final days

	•	Day 14: Fly home

⸻

Option B: Italy + Amsterdam (13–14 days)
	•	Day 1–3: Amsterdam

	•	Day 4–6: Rome

	•	Day 7–9: Amalfi Coast (base in Sorrento)

	•	Day 10–12: Florence

	•	Day 13: Fly home

(We can extend this by a day or two if needed)

⸻

What would you choose?
	•	Which trip sounds like a better fit for our style?
	•	Is the Italy summer heat/crowds really that bad? Also because of the Jublee 
	•	Would London + Scotland be as exciting and memorable?

Would love to hear thoughts, advice, and any experience-based recommendations.

TIA!

Good Time of Year For London?,"Hello all. Right now, my life is about as bad as it can get; my marriage of nearly six years has imploded (we were actually together for over 10 years in total) and I'm living in a hotel, back at home (my wife and I had moved to her home state and lived there for eight years) deserted by my so-called friends. I decided that I'm going to fulfill a lifetime dream of visiting London. Otherwise, I'm just going to rot in this room until my housing situation starts on April 1. So I downloaded the UK ETA app, filled it out, and was shocked to have an approval in about 30 seconds. All I have to do now is book the trip, which I'm going to do shortly. It'll be me traveling alone. Based on what I'm seeing on Priceline, the hotel I'll be staying at will be in Ilford. Is that a mistake? Should I look for somewhere else? I probably could spend a bit more. I don't want to stay in a hostel, that's for sure. I'm autistic and the thought of sharing a space with a bunch of strangers causes me great anxiety.

"Argentina…..MEH!
","After reading a recent thread about how wonderful Argentina is, my thoughts after visiting last month. 

I was a couple of weeks and visited Buenos Aires, Bariloche, El Calafate, Ushuaia and Iguazú. From best to worst: 

Iguazú: the falls are really astonishing.

Ushuaia: very interesting, unique place

El Calafate (Perito Moreno): definitely worth it but for some reason the glacier wasn't that wow feeling I had in Iguazú

Bariloche: rented a car. Cool place but honestly you can see the same stuff or better in some parts in Europe or North America (Alps, Rocky mountains, etc)

Buenos Aires: ran down hole. I spent three days and there were too many. Unsafe, uber expensive, for a big city there are plenty more interesting in Europe and even North America. 

Now the bad things:

**- Safety:** Argentina is NOT a safe country. Buenos Aires is not a safe city despite how locals will try to convince you. Whoever says ""central Buenos Aires is like New York/Miami/London/Paris"" is in complete denial.

I never left premium areas (Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, Belgrano, Microcentro, etc.) and you could see people (locals!) looking around while using their phones. Or whenever I walked down the street, if I ""overtook"" another person on a walkway, he or she will look back to check that I was not ""safety threat"". Many people with their backpacks on the front.

I took Ubers back and forth to La Boca and the areas around where complete slums. I wouldn't have liked my Uber broke down there. xD

On the other hand for instance Ushuaia felt safe. But Ushuaia is a small town isolated from the world.

**- Prices:** I was not expecting Argentina to be cheap but it is a complete joke now. Prices make no logic. The dollar blue (more convenient) is now roughly 10% more convenient than the official rate. So it was not about me exchanging dollars in the wrong places. 

  
Just an example. The Prison in Ushuaia (a small local museum) was 36.700 ARS in September (maybe the prices have been increased because inflation and the website is not updated)

[https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen](https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen)

That means that in the ""dollar blue"" (the unofficial more favorable exchange), it is 32 USD

[https://cuex.com/en/ars\_pa-usd](https://cuex.com/en/ars_pa-usd)

The Louvre museum (they recently increased prices) is 22 EUR. Or 23 USD

[https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission](https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission)

So a small museum in Ushuaia is more expensive than the Louvre.

The minitrekking in Perito Moreno (walking in the glacier) is now 480,000 ARS + 45,000 ARS for the entrance to the park (compulsory). So a total of 525,000 ARS or (!) 466 USD just for walking in the glacier (with a group) for about 2 hours. It is nice but nothing really glamourous or private. Just a typical group being taken from left to right on big buses then big boat then big group walking the glacier. 

[https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/](https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/)

I have been quite a few times in Switzerland and once in Norway and I never felt that ""ripped off"". At least Switzerland/Norway are top notch, clean, wealthy countries, but no offence Argentina is at best a ""second world"" country. So you are paying those prices in quite a dysfunctional environment.

**- Inconvenience:** 

Argentina is quite a dysfunctional country so expect inconvenience. For instance, flights. I paid a fortune for domestic flights (I flew Aerolíneas and flyBondi) and I had a few big delays. I could see on the screens plenty of cancelled flights. And right now (as of November 10, 2024) there are strikes that leave airports closed. So good luck if you are stranded in Ushuaia which is like 3,000 km to Buenos Aires which itself is like 10,000 km to the US or Europe. 

My advice is that Argentina is not worth the visit right now. 

Prices are completely out of control. The inflation stuff changes all the time, so maybe booking a holiday 3 months from now means that in January (for instance) prices will be 30% more expensive (or cheaper). 

There are a lot of social issues (I remember - I read Spanish -) reading in the newspapers in the street that 52% of Argentinians live below the poverty line. That means strikes, crime, etc. that can affect you directly or indirectly.

Just wait for things to calm and it might be worth to visit. Skip Buenos Aires (just one day max to check it out) and venture into the nature that is worth visiting.

London to USA with layover in Dublin (pre clearance). Does anyone have experience of this?,"Hi all. I'm planning a solo trip to the USA (Boston) and I am weighing up my options. I've become aware that Dublin has US pre-clearance so you go through the passport checks etc before actually boarding the flight, not when you get to the US. 

This seems like such a good idea because I cant think of anything worse than having to queue for ages after a long overseas flight but I'm wary of timings and whether it will just add a different kind of stress. I plan to get a flight with a long layover in Dublin (2.5 hours plus) to ensure there's enough time but obviously I know there's no absolute guarantee. 

I also wondered if I use the same airline for the duration (Heathrow to Dublin and Dublin to Boston on Aer Lingus) that if I check my bags in at Heathrow, they go all the way to Boston without me having to pick them up and check them again at Dublin? 

I wondered if anyone could share their experiences and whether it'd be worth taking this route. Thanks 🙂",0,19,1742653411.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jh9jre/london_to_usa_with_layover_in_dublin_pre/,Doughnut91

Is London worth visiting as a solo traveller?,"I'm an 18F and I'm visiting New York for the holidays so I'm considering dropping by London for a little bit before I head back home but my parents think it'll be incredibly boring going there all by myself.

Weekend Trip Ideas from London,"I'll be staying in London throughout August, and I'm hoping to squeeze in some weekend trips around Europe — proper backpacker style. I’m free from Friday 4PM and need to be back by Sunday night.

It might help to know I’m really into traditional vibes and local food — so if there's a place that nails both *and* feels totally different from London, that’s a huge plus.

Planning a 2 week trip to London with my bf for Valentines 2025. Approximately how much money do you think I would need and what all should I do there?,"Hi guys! Im not sure if this is the right subreddit for this post so if it's not, please let me know <3

For starters, I am American and London is very much my DREAM vacation. I absolutely need to go to London. I found a sweet spot time to go and figured I could use this as a nice valentines vacation for me and my boyfriend. The plane tickets are cheaper during this time and so are the hotels.

Here's the thing. I want to stay in London for 2 weeks. I know that sounds crazy but I looked up the hotels and a lot of them are just $2k for 2 weeks. So hypothetically speaking, for both of our plane tickets and the hotel, we're looking at $3200. I think that is a very reasonable price and was actually shocked. Of course we would be splitting the costs in half so that's not a problem. 

I have a ton of questions but I will try to keep this post short and to the point. 

1. How much money do you think we would each need in London for 2 weeks? (for food, entertainment, traversing)

2. We want to go to Paris one of those days so that we can visit Disneyland. How much money should I have for just that day? (the park ticket and train ticket to get to and from + food)

3. How do the buses work? We would like to do Top Golf one of those days but its around 40 minutes away from the hotel and we're unsure how far the buses travel.

4. How do different currencies work? This is my very first time ever going out of the country. So I need to know how different currencies work. I know there's probably a different subreddit for this so again just let me know if there is. But I am wondering if euro's are worth more than USD? or the other way around?

5. If you've been to London and have some recommendations on activities we should do or food we should try, please inform me! It would be greatly appreciated!

Again this is my dream vacation and I want everything to be planned out to a T as I dont know when I will be able to come back to this amazing place.

"First time traveling to Europe- how to efficiently spend 2 weeks (London, Paris…Madrid)?","Hi everyone,

My wife and I got married last year. We were planning to spend the second leg of our honeymoon in Europe, but based on availability, points conversions etc ., it’ll be better to go in September and use this as our belated First Year Wedding Anniversary travel rather than honeymoon.

We would definitely start out by flying into London and spend 3-4 days there. From there, we’d go to Paris either by train or flight and spend at least 4 days here. Having an extra day in Paris is very important to my wife. We really only planned on London and Paris, so aren’t sure what would make the most sense to do with the rest of our trip. I was thinking of either going to Spain and spending 3-4 days in Madrid, or splitting that equally between Madrid and Barcelona.

I think this is how we’ll ultimately end up before returning home to South Florida:

London for 4 full days 
Paris for 4 full days
Madrid for 4 full days

Account for 2 days spent in the air.

Would it make sense to get back to London and catch the round trip back to South Florida from Heathrow (on points), or would it be better to just do a one way back from Spain for the sake of time?

Or, are we selling our selves short? With only 14 days, should we hone in on 2 cities only? Or should we add an extra day or 2 to our trip, work and $$$ permitting?

"First time in London, train question ","I am so sorry well in advance for my sheer ignorance. I feel so dumb. I did search the s/travel sub but found nothing. Mostly advice asking if people should fly or take the train.

I am traveling from Mexico to London ( 16 days) and wanted to head to Edinburg for 10 days.

We land at LHR and want to take the train to Edinburg. What is the closest train station to LHR? And what is the best way to get there?

Thank you!

Edit: you guys Rock. We landed in LHR a few hours ago. I was able ( due to everyone’s advice) able to navigate the airport and trains!! 

This may seem so extra but, having everyone’s help and encouragement really was touching. I’m 4 weeks post op from a major surgery ( not even sure I’d survive it). So everything seems daunting and exciting at the same time.

Potential 1 month vacation in February:  Rome or London?,"So I got a bit of good news/bad news with my traveling window this upcoming few months.  The good news is I got approved a month window for vacation.  The bad news is.......its in February.  Not ideal, but at least it will be cheaper and fewer crowds, which I certainly will appreciate that.  Be that as it may, need some help deciding on this one.  Which one would you choose and why?  

Also, Ive done enough 3-5 day city jaunts in my time.  I was looking at a city where I could really spend some serious time to explore and get to know.  I crossed off city after city and now I am on my final two choices.  Day trip options are fine though (stonehenge, bath, oxford, cambridge) or \[florence, bologna, pompeii, pisa\].

Which capital city gets a lot of hate that you loved visiting? ,"It’s common for people to shit on visiting capital cities. They often get labeled as too touristy, too crowded, unsafe, inauthentic, boring, etc. I don’t understand how people can get bored in a city with millions of people and ton’s of attractions, but everyone’s entitled to their opinion so I respect that. 

So what’s a city you visited that gets constant hate but you ended up loving? I’ll start. This year, I visited Lima Peru, Santiago Chile, and Brussels. These 3 cities constantly get shit on for being bland but I loved each one. Lima has some of the best food you will ever eat, and the nightlife is underrated. Santiago also has solid nightlife even tho it always gets labeled as boring. I also loved how modern Santiago looked and the close proximity to nature. Brussels is probably the city I’ve heard people complain about the most of the 3. But then I get there and it’s a city full of great beer, great chocolate/waffles, and amazing architecture. I could never be disappointed 😂",460,937,1735294908.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hnc1b6/which_capital_city_gets_a_lot_of_hate_that_you/,Lem__Mann7

"Going to Europe this summer, starting off in London and wondering if the cities I've chosen to visit: Prague, Brussels, and Berlin have a good mix of city vibes with countryside scenic spots that are easily accessible","Hello!! I'm planning a trip this summer and would love some advice. I'm heading to Edinburgh for the Oasis concert and taking two weeks to explore some European countries I haven't visited before. My current plan is to spend 2–3 days in London, then visit Prague, Brussels, and Berlin.

For context, I’ve been to Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, as well as a few other countries. I love exploring the countryside but also enjoy wandering through big, beautiful cities—getting lost in the crowd rather than spending too much time in museums.

I have a few questions:

1. Are these cities good to visit in the summer?
2. Do these countries have easily accessible countryside or scenic spots worth visiting?
3. How would you recommend splitting my time between these destinations?

Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance. 😊",0,17,1741710178.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1j8upy4/going_to_europe_this_summer_starting_off_in/,alotlikev
visiting Hamburg vs London?,"I'm flying out to visit a family member in Lincoln next month (12-22 of may, we'll also travel further north and possibly west - Peak District, Lake, District, York etc.) and I have a few days (22-26) to spend before getting to Aachen to visit a friend.

The situation is this:
The friend I'm visiting lives in Aachen but he's visiting Hamburg or the weekend (23-26).
So I have two options:
1. Go to London for the weekend and then fly out to Dusseldorf/Cologne and take the train to Aachen.
2. Fly out to Hamburg on the 22nd, spend a day in Hamburg by myself and then meet said friend Friday evening. Returning to Aachen (with the friend) on the 26th via train from Hamburg.

As for London - technically I've already been, but it was a decade ago, it was a short visit, and I was a young teen. So I don't remember much.
For Hamburg - I've only been to Berlin previously. Otherwise, I have the additional benefit of being able to crash at his AirBnB and tag along with him to see the [King of the court finals](https://kingofthecourt.com/).

Budget wise - I'm flexible, but not trying to splurge. Would like to mostly spend on foods and attractions instead of fancy hotels.

The question boils down to: For now, I'm leaning towards London seeing as it's known to have many attractions, *but*, I'm quite ignorant of Hamburg. So I'm unsure if there's interesting stuff to experience that I could be missing out on.
In terms of interests: I'd like to try out good food (street cart or fancy restaurant, either way works), walk around and experience the area by foot. Music, museums, culture in general. Generally speaking, I'm open to try out whatever is interesting wherever I'll visit.",0,10,1745835510.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k9s3a1/visiting_hamburg_vs_london/,throwaway154251

* Customs - 15 min to 2 hours
* ~~Heathrow Express (railway upgrade should be done by the time we are there) to Paddington Station, store luggage at Paddington Station with Bounce or Luggage Hero~~ Elizabeth Line to central London, store luggage with Luggage Hero

* Bus to Picadilly Circus, lunch in Soho
* Shopping in Covent Garden if there's time
* Tube to the Tower of London (or would this be scenic by bus?), short tour if time permits
* Tube to Abbey Road (by request)

Is that too much back and forth for such a short amount of time? Should we just go from London to Paris and then fly back home?

"Film student visiting London – any last-minute lectures, screenings, nature spots, or artsy events?","
Hi everyone!

I’m a film student visiting London for about 10 days this month, and I’m hoping to soak up as much creative, intellectual, and natural beauty as I can while I’m here.

I’m especially into surrealism and expressionism—artists like Max Ernst, Arshile Gorky, Salvador Dalí, and filmmakers like Luis Buñuel, Alfonso Cuarón, Peter Greenaway, and Wes Anderson. I also love literature and philosophy—Milan Kundera, Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, and Joan Didion are some of my favorites.

Are there any last-minute public lectures, film screenings, short workshops, or gallery events I can still sign up for? I’d love recommendations for:
– Arthouse cinemas or indie theatres
– Surrealist or experimental film events
– Lectures at universities like UCL, King's, LSE
– Bookstores with character (especially ones with events/readings)
– Art shows or immersive installations

Also, I’d really love to spend time in nature—any parks, gardens, riversides, forests, or scenic day trips where I can enjoy greenery or water would be amazing.

Lastly, I know a lot has been happening around David Lynch recently following his passing—if there are any Lynch-related events, retrospectives, or screenings happening, I’d love to hear about them.

As you can probably tell, I’m interested in a lot of things, so I’m open to any suggestions—especially the more offbeat or local gems.

What is with this? Like, do you think you are entitled to a solo picture in Times Square? Or in front of the Sydney opera house?

"3 days from London, but I've been lots of places already","Hi, I (26f, Australian) am currently travelling around Andalusia solo and will be going to London for a short trip to see my boyfriend. Problem is, I have to be back in London 4 days later so I have a window of time free but am not sure where to go/what to see. 

My boyfriend leaves the night of the 25th of September and I need to be back in London by the 29th of September (night). So that gives me 3 full days only. I have been to London many times, so don't want to stay there. I've also done Brighton + surrounds, Bath, Leeds/York, Manchester, Edinburgh/Glasgow and lots of Ireland because I've lived in the UK a bit. I've also been to Paris, which is the next logical step. 

I've been searching options for days and just can't decide what to do. Here are the two options I have most been liking (but don't love either):

1. Fly out to somewhere sunny like Mallorca and lounge in a resort, but I'm not sure I'd enjoy it as a solo traveller (I think I'd get bored). 
2. Do a multi-day tour so I can spend some time with people (I've been craving that a bit) but it feels like such a short window.

What I like: nature/magnificent landscapes, the sun, architecture/historic buildings, talking to people
What I don't like: museums and food isn't a driver for me

Budget: the cheaper the better, but I don't like staying in dirt cheap places. I wouldn't want to pay more than $350 aud per day (all inclusive) and max $800aud for return flights to london

" Is £1,500 Enough for Two People in London for 4-5 Days? Need Advice!","Hi Reddit,

My sister and I are planning a trip to London next year, likely in January or February. I’m writing this post early because of the current state of Turkey’s economy and the fact that we’re both students. Here's our situation:

# Our Plan

1. **Budget:** We plan to cover our accommodation, food, sightseeing, and possibly some shopping expenses with £1,500 for two people. Flights and some extra pocket money will be covered by my family.
2. **Saving Strategy:** I plan to work a part-time job for three months this summer to save up for my share of the trip. My sister's expenses will be handled by our family.
3. **Food:** To save money, we’re planning to:
   * Have simple breakfasts with bread from local markets and Turkish staples like salami and cheese we’ll bring from home.
   * Use ready-to-eat meals from Turkey for some lunches and dinners. That said, we’d love to enjoy local food occasionally:
   * Trying **fish and chips** or other affordable dishes from British cuisine a few times.
   * Experiencing **afternoon tea** once or twice during the trip.
4. **Sightseeing:** We’re focusing on free or budget-friendly attractions:
   * Free museums and galleries (like the British Museum and National Gallery).
   * Iconic spots such as the London Eye (from outside), Tower Bridge, Thames River, and London parks.
   * Visiting the exteriors of royal landmarks (like Buckingham Palace or Kensington Palace).

# Questions:

* **Is £1,500 enough?** Can we realistically stick to this budget for 4-5 days in London, covering accommodation, food, and sightseeing?
* **Affordable accommodation tips:** Are there any clean and safe hostels or Airbnbs with kitchen facilities that you’d recommend?
* **Halal food and cheap eats:** Any affordable local dishes we could try that align with halal dietary restrictions?
* **Budget-friendly attractions:** Any hidden gems or free places to visit that might not be as well-known?

I know it seems like we’re trying to spend as little as possible, but our goal is to have an economical trip that’s still enjoyable and memorable.

Will my upcoming trip to London be miserable with a bad foot?,"Hello everyone!

I was going to visit London (never been to the UK) later this Summer but recently hurt my foot pretty bad.  It's mostly healed and I can walk on it short distances but I don't think I will be able to do large amounts of walking on it by the time of my trip. Typically on trips I can rack up 20 thousand steps a day, but there is no way I will be able to do that.

London apparently has a pretty extensive public transit system so I'm hoping that will keep walking to a minimum but I'm wondering if I should just reschedule the whole thing for another time.  For those who have done all the touristy things, how much time did you spend walking vs on public transport?  How many steps a day were you taking?

Get through customs and there is the exit with 2 options - nothing to declare, and declare. To be safe I head over to the declare side, where the counter area is roped off.

So I ended up walking through with things I'm sure were fine to have, but wasn't able to declare anything.

I want to travel from Sydney to London without (or minimal as possible) flying. What are the chances of this being possible in the current global situation?,"I 20M have dreamed about doing a trip like this since I was a child and would plan on doing this in early 2025. My planned route would firstly take me from Sydney to Darwin, most likely on buses through Queensland and the NT. I would probably already fail in not flying at this point, as I understand that it's virtually impossible to cross from Australia to Indonesia by boat but this would ideally be the only flight of my journey. After flying to Timor, I would island-hop through Indonesia using a variety of buses and ferries in order to eventually make my way to Singapore, then travelling through Malaysia, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam before crossing into China.

China itself shouldn't be too much of an issue, however isn't an easy place to travel through as an English-speaking westerner (I learned this last year when my VPN didn't work and virtually nowhere accepted VISA and Mastercard, coupled with the limited level of English. This was in Shenzhen as well, one of the more modern cities).  Where I go after from China is the main problem as although there are many potential routes, they aren't exactly as easy to take as they used to be. I would've planned on making my way to Urumqi in Xinjiang by train and then taking the overnight train from Urumqi to Almaty in Kazakhstan, however this service is yet to resume since COVID and there's pretty much no way of knowing when it will . This is combined with the fact that Xinjiang is a very sensitive area and I don't know how the authorities would react to a random westerner travelling solo through there (I've heard mixed reports about this). Another potential route would be taking a train from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar but once again, this train isn't operational yet although by the looks of things crossing this border is still possible, then I could catch a train once on the Mongolian side. This would leave me no choice but to go through Russia and cross the border into Kazakhstan, which although is still possible to do, I don't know if I'd fancy it unless the situation there dramatically improves in the next year or so. 

Hypothetically I do make it to Kazakhstan, I would then make my way across the country and take a ferry across the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan before travelling through the Caucasus, Turkey, up through the Balkans and into Western Europe to eventually arrive in London. Such a trip would've been extremely doable even 5 years ago, but with the way things are at the moment, it seems just so far fetched. The only way to avoid China and Central Asia altogether would involve going through India, Pakistan and Iran and getting to Turkey that way, but I don't exactly have a death wish and not to mention that it would require travelling through war-torn Myanmar as well. 

What do you think? Am I mad? Lots of others have successfully done similar trips to this but I feel given the current situation it would be harder than ever.",46,47,1711285548.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bmkav0/i_want_to_travel_from_sydney_to_london_without_or/,dayegeh

Help - Usyk vs Dubois fight at Wembley to London Heathrow,"Hi all,

Looking for some help here,

I’ll be attending the Usyk vs Dubois fight at Wembley on July 19th, and I’ll be travelling with my 78-year-old uncle. We’re flying into London Heathrow, heading straight to the Wembley event, and will stay at a hotel near Heathrow for the night.

We expect to leave Wembley around 23:15 after the fight, but I’m curious how long it will take to get to Central London (or Heathrow) with the crowds departing from Wembley. Specifically, how long should we expect the journey to be by bus or train?

It looks like the last train to Heathrow on a Sunday morning is around 00:30, but I wanted to confirm if that’s correct.

For those who have been to a fight at Wembley before, I’d love to hear your experiences:

Where did you stay?

What was the approximate cost of accommodation

What transport did you use to get from Wembley to your accommodation

What cities are deceivingly cheap or expensive?,"For example, London and Washington are considered expensive cities to visit. But a family of 4 can visit museums for free over the course of a week that would cost them $500 in entry fees in other cities.

Meanwhile “cheap” cities like Istanbul now charge $30-50 for each of their Top 10 landmarks, so visiting Basilica Cistern, Galata Tower, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi in just one day is going to cost $150 per person.

Barcelona is also considered a “cheap city” because food and walking around is cheap, but hotels seem very pricey and every attraction was a $$$ pit. Even smaller places that took only an hour or so: €25 for Casa Mila, €35 for Casa Batllo, etc.

- Walk around Trafalgar Square
- Visit the National Gallery

- See the Imperial Churchill War Rooms

Bath/Stonehenge from London,"Hello all, any advice/recommendations would be much appreciated! My mum is visiting from abroad in a couple of weeks and she really wants to do a day trip from London.

However, I just looked at Delta and flying into Paris with a departure out of London is significantly cheaper. I’m curious as to why? I will be traveling in late November during Thanksgiving week, if that makes any difference in this. Are there advantages to going to Paris first or does it really make a difference?

West coast to London flights in June,"Trying to go to England (from Seattle) mid-late June.

Flight prices are pretty high right now, around $1500 with a checked bag, and I'm trying to gather options for making it more doable. Family suggested using air miles to fly to NYC and then purchasing a JFK-LHR flight, or flying to a less popular European city (ie Brussels) and taking the train over to London, though I've been to Europe before and I know train tickets can also add up. 

Thoughts on doing one of those things instead, or should I wait and see if prices go down closer to travel time? I don't want to wait too long and risk booking it last minute, I feel like I'm already almost cutting it too close, but I've read that prices do fluctuate a bit closer to date of travel. Any insight?

Roast my London Spring Break itinerary?,"(second try, without the links)

Wife and I (both circa 40, give or take a year) are headed over, landing March 9th, out March 13th. For context, we'd lived in Essex for a year pre-Covid and have traveled to London either together or separately at least a dozen times over the years. She loves the Tate Museum and the theater, I love the football (COYI) - typical.

Other things I'm interested in: quirky food places, unique grocery stores (think I may need to take some inspiration from Harrison Webb before we go), motor racing, furry creatures and anything to do with blackcurrant and gooseberry (seriously, we don't have them in the States).

This time the theme for me is to see as many places as I can that featured in my two favorite Guy Ritchie films: ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" and whatever else is on the way. We will likely split up on one or two days so that the missus can museum-hop and I can do my thing.

The basics:

**Arrive**: March 9, 7:00

**Stay**: 100 Queen's Gate Hotel (Kensington), then Hilton Garden Inn Heathrow T2/T3 for the final night

**Depart**: March 13, 9:20

Plans so far as follows:

**March 9**: Arrive, take it easy. We don't sleep on planes, so on most trips to Europe, we usually come to the hotel to clean up and crash for a couple hours, then let our state (and the weather) dictate what happens next. That is if we can check in early. Hopefully, with the booking having been made through Amex Platinum's Fine Hotels, we will be able to, but I might write to them ahead of time to make sure.

**March 10:**

Morning/afternoon: visit a friend in Buckhurst Hill and hit as many Ritchie locations as I can. Swing by Fortitude Bakehouse at 11 for beignets while I'm at it since I'll be in the area. This may move to the next day if the weather doesn't cooperate, but I'll need to be in East London for the football match anyways, so may as well make the most of it.

Evening:

* Me: West Ham - Newcastle, 20:00
* Wife: Richard II at the Bridge, 19:30

**March 11:**

Morning: depending on weather and how tired I am from the day before, I might revisit my Ted Lasso locations map. I did visit most of them last year, but for half of it I was fighting off Covid, so not much has stuck (and my camera was awful - I was using Meta glasses - and this year I'd like to try and make a proper vlog of it). As an alternative, if weather holds and I am employed by then, we might hike out to Kent to play zookeeper for a day at the Fenn Bell project. Maybe. It might be difficult getting there and back in time for the theatre in the evening.

Evening: Dear England at the National Theatre at 19:30 (together)

**March 12:**

Morning/afternoon: if the weather allows, we want to go to Arundel to see where ""Wicked Little Letters"" was filmed.

Evening:

* Me: schlep our stuff to the HGI, maybe come back to the city after
* Wife: Oedipus at the Old Vic, 19:30

London-Paris and Lucerne or Amsterdam or someplace else?,"Hello all I am done with medical training soon and finally have the luxury of funemployment to travel before I start work. 

We are definitely doing London (4-5 nights), Paris (4-5 nights). We are stuck on what other city (maybe 1-2 max) to tack on. Caveat is we’ll have a 6 month old with us. Options:

- originally wanted Rome but Jubilee is happening so I’ll just save it for a full trip to Italy and surrounding areas in the future

- Amsterdam - easy to get to from Paris, though I’m just not as excited about it for some reason? Do people really enjoy it? I worry I’ll be underwhelmed coming from London and Paris

- Lucerne Switzerland with 1 day trip to Interlaken: only concern is the logistics may be harder to figure out as it’s not a major city with easy access to everything like London or Paris. But the scenery looks beautiful. I also visited Lake como before and found it beautiful but boring and would have preferred to spend more time in a big city like Venice

How are Air India's B787-9s on the London Heathrow to New Delhi route?,"I am flying to India in late July through Air India on economy and I have flown with them for several years. I have heard many terrible reviews of Air India and especially on their long haul flights. However many of these reviews have come from before the TATA takeover a few years ago, however I am not sure that they have updated any of their older planes like the B787s or B777s, so for anyone who has travelled on Air India on this route on the B787-9s recently. Have the planes got broken seat or broken In flight entertainment or has the software on the planes been fixed? How is the punctuality on Air India as I have a flight from New Delhi to Kolkata in terminal 3 of New Delhi airport in less than 2 hours after my flight, and I am aware that Heathrow has a lot of delayed flights, even with an airline like Virgin Atlantic, so  what is the chance that my flight with Air India will be delayed?",2,3,1744720626.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzqsyo/how_are_air_indias_b7879s_on_the_london_heathrow/,Party_Smile_8203
Trip to Dublin via London: how best to book train and ferry?,"Good day everyone!

In May this year, me and my partner want to travel to and around Ireland by public transport. We've booked a train to London and want to do the trip from there to Dublin. I see there is a connection from London Euston to Holyhead and we want to take the ferry from there.

At first we were interested in this Sail & Rail Special by Irish Ferries, but I see these are unavailable to buy online according to the website. Does this maybe have something to do with the damage of the storm earlier this year? It is strange anyway, because it is possible for me to just book a regular ferry trip. Does anyone maybe know why this is?

Right now I am considering just booking the train at [nationalrail.co.uk](http://nationalrail.co.uk/) and booking the ferry at either [irishferries.com](http://irishferries.com/) or stenaline.com. However, I checked for the entire trip from London to Dublin on raileurope.com and up there they offer the entire trip for quite a bit less money than I would be paying for the first two bookings. I've booked on raileurope.com before and it was all fine and worked really well. I just don't understand how it can be so much cheaper. It would be a difference of about 60 Euros. So what's up with that? It does mention it would do the ferry with Wales Ferry instead of Irish Ferries or Stena?

Thanks a lot in advance!",2,5,1742835466.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jivlm5/trip_to_dublin_via_london_how_best_to_book_train/,lideilere
Why I will never use Airbnb anymore and you shouldn't too.,"I won't write long and just be brief about the whole Airbnb experience over the last 1-2 years. I enjoyed using Airbnb for more than 7 years, and now it has come to a point that I will never use it. In the beginning, Airbnb was more organic and personal experience where you could actually enjoy staying in the hosts' place. 

&#x200B;

1) However, now the airbnb is filled with hosts that are just in it for the business and doesn't deliver the adequate service or experience that it used to be. Most of the places aren't well equipped or are vacant, and most of the places are just vacant housing that has not been rented out yet. 

2) And whenever face this kind of issue, the host doesn't take any responsibility. And when you reach out to Airbnb about this issue, their attitude before was ""let me see how I can help you"" to now ""too bad. we can't do anything about it."" or ""we will try to help you out, and see the solution"" and no answer.

3) Prices are way overpriced compared to the price index of the countries I have visited. For example, when I visited Ukraine, Peru, Colombia, and Spain, the daily rent prices were about 5-6x rate of the monthly rent price rate. Which I think it way too overpriced.

&#x200B;

Personally, I have been using Airbnb while I traveled in the past 1.5 years, traveling to about 6 countries: Ukraine, Portugal, United States, Spain, Colombia, and Peru. I had multiple experiences where I checked into the listing that looked a lot different from the photo and doesn't have even a basic amenities, like hot shower, wifi, electronics. I had an experience where I checked into the listing that the host said it's a ""bit"" noisy, but the noise pollution was too extreme to the point that I felt like I was sleeping on a highway street, because the wall has an open air. I messaged host about this, and he ignored my messages. I contacted Airbnb support, and was on the phone line for hours trying to deliver my struggle of insomnia due to noise pollution and that I couldn't sleep for 2 days, and had to check out early from the listing. I think I lost about $400\~ already from the listings that didn't have amenities it described, or even fails to deliver the basic needs of what it can be actually called an ""housing service""

Anyways, the Airbnb support really doesn't care or help the customer, at least based on my experience. I don't know what your experience is. But Airbnb is now filled with hosts that deliver the services or amenity with really poor quality listing, mostly the properties that has not been rented out, for extremely high price.

If you guys could give me alternatives to Airbnb I would appreciate it. I'm sick of this money grabbing host and tech company that doesn't care about customer.

Edit: some people keep saying do the diligence of reading reviews and research, and I do research listings 3-4 hours before I make a booking, and all the bad experiences happened in listings with over 4 stars. And I left 1 star reviews and it would never show up on the listing after few weeks. So there is really a loophole where host controls the review somehow that I do not know about (report to Airbnb for removal, etc)",2232,743,1640070590.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rl8wuy/why_i_will_never_use_airbnb_anymore_and_you/,Country-Formal
Divorcee to be! Just booked my flight to Dublin -> London -> Paris! Tips!?,"Aloha family! Been married 5 years turns out my husband has been cheating! Hurray! So I Filed for divorce and bought my ticket to places that I’ve always wanted to go but haven’t because my soon to be ex husband didn’t see the point! This is my first time traveling internationally besides Mexico. I know a moderate French. What are your tips as a first time female solo traveler in these cities. Any fav places? Safety? Let me know!

Edit: I have 10 full days to explore. I’m thinking 3 days in Ireland , 3 in London and 4 in Paris. I’m going in November. I love to hike, love mountains and interested in seeing castles. I was thinking of getting to Dublin, driving to Galloway then taking the plane to London from there (this is hypothetical) open to any and all advice. I don’t have the biggest budget but since I mainly like nature things. I was thinking 150 a day for food and fun?

specific and general travel questions UK/London,"On a whim I booked a flight to london in September.  Ive had my eye on going there for a while now, and have some questions.

The specific one regards roman/neolithic sites.  I know theres a mithreum in london and the area/house under that one building, some sections of the Londonium wall and a few others.  In the UK in general, theres hadrians wall and related sites, Bath and York.  Neolithic wise theres Stonehenge of course, and the avebury site, woodhenge and salsbury sites.  I dont mind having to travel to places, but aside from watching like 20 years of history shows to remember things are there any that you guys would recommend?  Even off the beaten path sites that are relatively easy to access?

Nothing is booked aside from the flight.  I plan to spand a week in London exploring the city and surrounding area with some day trips.  However id like to possibly head up to edinbourough and maybe stop along the way.  Especially to see some of hadrians wall.  The main place/easiest so far seems to be new castle upon tyne.  York looks interesting as well.  I havnt really gone too deep in this, as im currently heading to France in 2 weeks.  But id like to get a head start and seeing what is viable.  My interests are mainly plants, history (more roman/greek but history is history), architecture, and I have a pretty deep liking for gothic churches.  Just hoping for some places to start with, or areas to look at.

The only things I want to see for sure are the british museum, Kew gardens, tower of london and stonehenge.  I do have a larger short list of things but these ones are non negotiable for me.  And yes, I realize theyre all London specifically.  As I said im just starting off.

Id also appreciate any tips for the UK in general as well.  Ive watched a few videos on the subject and its relatively straight forward.  ""Things to know"" are super similar to here in Canada.",1,5,1742501058.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jfy552/specific_and_general_travel_questions_uklondon/,incorrect_wolverine

"London, Belgium or Amsterdam","I'm flying into Paris in late December. I'm thinking of spending 3 days in either Belgium (probably stay in Brussels and mainly visit there but can do day trips to other parts), Amsterdam or London before heading down south.

I have 2 young kids (6 and 10) and I'm aware that it'll be fairly cold and miserable then. So probably looking for a city with more indoorsy type activities. 

If you had 3 days to spend in each of these cities in the middle of winter where you had to entertain 2 kids, what would you pick?

What thinking is probably Belgium right - there seems to be quite a lot of musuems and attractions that we can go to if the weather turns, and it seems really cheap to get there from Paris.",1,29,1724463422.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1eztr5p/london_belgium_or_amsterdam/,your-lost-elephant
Our honeymoon to the USA!,"We decided to elope to Las Vegas (from the UK) to get married, as we didn’t want a traditional wedding. We visited Las Vegas, Arozona, ans LA. The highlights:

Las Vegas Highlights: 

1. The shows. For us this is the best reason to go to vegas. Especially liked KA by Cirque du Soleil
2. In N Out Burger. Worth the hype. Super delicious and great value for money!
3. The Mob Museum. Really interesting and has some great artifacts in there!
4. Gambling of course. Just super fun as long as it’s a safe thing for you to do. Pick an anount you wouldn’t care if you lost, and stick to that budget!

Arizona Highlights:

1. The Grand Canyon. Could it be anything else? Probably the most amazing thing I have ever seen.
2. Sedona. Wow what an anazing place. If you live there, you are truely living the dream.
3. Horse riding through the countryside. Felt like I was in RDR2. Amazing fun!
4. Leather goods shop in Williams (the town close to the grand canyon). Bought myselt a Wranger there and the wife got some cowgirl stuff. Such a fun shop and we spend a bit of cash in aomw good quality artifacts!

Los Angeles Highlights:

1. Controversial perhaps, but my favourite city i’ve ever visited. Especially Santa Monica - i left my heart there! So nice to be able to walk the beach and gaze out to the pacific ocean.
2. Lakers NBA game. As a massive football fan who frequently goes to see my team (Arsenal) live in north London, we were keen to try a different sport. I know nothing about basketball but wow was it amazing. The skill, the tactics. And I see was people consider LeBron James to be one of the GOATs.
3. The movie lots. The history of film is all here and its so interesting. We did two tours (paramount and WB) and wow was it a highlight.
4. Food. Probably some of the best food i’ve eve had. The highlight was butrito and beer from the mexican part of LA. Just incredible - I wish I made a note of the restaurants name!

Anyone planning a similar trip, feel free to leave questiona/comments etc!

"London, Paris, Venice, Rome!","hi guys! new to traveling and my first big trip i'm planning with one of my friends is for summer 2026. we're hoping visit London, Paris, Venice, and Rome. But our dilemma is that we only can afford about 10 days as it looks because we don't wanna be doing hostels and trains/plane fare is rather expensive as it looks for summers in Europe. Just wanted to come onto the subreddit to see if this would even be a possible trip with all of the places we genuinely want to explore. I'm willing to expand the trip up to two days to account for travel.

I'm not really looking to stay IN Paris but rather a place a train ride away (personal preference, probably not logical but i don't care much haha).

"London lodgings, please help me not second-guess myself 🤣","Hi, my name is Lauren and I get hotel anxiety about picking the right hotel. I've only been to London once for 2 days in college (took the overnight bus from Glasgow and stayed in a hostel, oh to be young) so I'm going in the end of April to run the London Marathon and spending a week in London before heading to Paris. I know the tube is super convenient but just wanted some feedback on my hotel choice. I'm running the marathon so I need a comfy bed, coffee and a nice shower 🤣 plus close to train station. I've got three booked and need to cancel two of those:

-Park plaza Westminster 
Near the end of the race, more touristy I know
-London Bridge Hotel
- Hoxton Southwark (the hotel I was leaning towards) 

Also had a friend recommend Kensington area but wasn't sure what affordable hotels I could find there. 

I like that Southwark is near the river, still walkable and  seems like a cool neighborhood. I just want to stay in an area easy to get around for a tourist but that isn't tourist central if that makes sense.  My partner and I are in our late 30s and while we're obviously total tourists to London aside from the usual sights we value more artsy areas of cities (cool markets, third wave coffee shops, unique pubs). We live in Baltimore so we are used to being city folk!

"Looking for cozy, fun, unique London recommendations for an anxious, new traveller, anniversary trip","Hi! Heading to London next year with my boyfriend for our 10-year anniversary (!) and looking for ideas for where to stay, activities and experiences, shops, day trips, restaurants, and parks, for a relaxed, cozy, fun trip. 

**Important context:** We have been to London once before and did all of the major tourist attractions, which we mostly found crowded and overwhelming. Glad we saw them, but looking to take things slower and travel more off the beaten path this time since we are homebodies and new to traveling.

**Timeline:** March, April, September, or October for \~6 nights. We don't mind the cold or rain of shoulder seasons :)

**Budget:** Flexible and willing to splurge a little since it is a special trip and we don't travel often. Flights will cost us around \~$1,500 total, and hope to keep hotel at $1,500 or less.

**Things we like:** Birding, F1, board games, crafting + sewing, stationary, lego, books, tennis, coins, easy hikes + nature, cafes, markets. Also big fan of Paddington Bear lol. 

**Dislike:** We are not really into drinking, night life, and food that is experimental / over the top / super pricey. Museums can be cool, but I don't enjoy to spend more than an hour or so at one. 

**Current ideas:** The Barbican, Neal’s Yard, day trip to Brighton, afternoon tea somewhere, Dishoom.

Me: <valiantly attempt to avoid elongated conversation about exactly how close in relation to London I live and exactly how close that is to the relative of the menu guardian who lived in England 10 years ago and the football club that both they and I support, and instead try to read beyond the word 'appetisers'>

Menu guardian <voice escalating in volume and urgency>: Everything here good. All GOOD! Mama in kitchen!

Me: Uh-huh, good to know, thanksbyenow! <fervently tries to release hand that was gripped without me even realising>

I love to look at a good menu. Pore over it, have a ponder as to what I might enjoy and whether the price is good. Google maps isn't the same.

But these guys are 24x7 eatery ninjas. I swear you could pitch up at 3am to the front of their restaurant and they'd be backflipping out of their balcony window in their dressing gowns, landing on top of their menu in protective stance to advise you breathlessly that ""prices very good! best in town!'

P.S nothing against Turkey in particular btw, can happen anywhere in the World. I'm sure it must work for some people as they wouldn't do it otherwise.

A city you did not expect yourself to enjoy a lot so much,"I was checking off a bucket list when I was in Europe for a long period. However, there were times when I was out of bucket list cities and wanted to go somewhere and found it amazing. 

In this scenario it was Strasbourg + Colmar, which were famous but not world-renowned. I thoroughly enjoyed the architecture, the scenery, the food and the atmosphere. With a mix of German and French influence, and a history of struggle between Germany and France over the region before WW2, I found it enchanting each moment I was there.

Would you fly from Dublin to Belgium or train from London?,"I'm seeing flights roundtrip from Los Angeles to Dublin for hundreds cheaper than LA to London. 


So I'm asking if you would fly to Dublin and stay a couple nights before a cheap flight to Belgium or would you pay extra to fly to Heathrow London and stay a night before taking the train directly to Belgium?

We have very little experience with trains but we also don't appreciate busy airports.
What would be more fun and less stressful? My partner is a nervous traveler so easier is better. We've visited both Dublin and London and enjoy them both. 

Traveling in mid August in case anyone has advice about flights or trains that time of the year. A couple years ago there were multiple strikes happening and we couldn't get a train! Always good to know in advance.

24 hours in London ,"Hi all, we’re planning a 24-hour stay (Nov 29-30) in London with our family (2 adults, 2 kids), arriving at Heathrow at 7 am and flying out of Gatwick the following morning at 9 am. We’ll have three carry-ons, one checked-size bag, a stroller, and backpacks. Here’s our rough plan, but we’d appreciate any feedback on the logistics!

1. **First Stop:** Planning to take an Uber from Heathrow to Northolt Station for a quick visit.
2. **Getting to Central London:** From Northolt, we’ll hop on a train to central London. Thinking of storing luggage near Victoria Station – is this a good choice based on our plans?
3. **Day in London:** Planning to explore Tower of London, Borough Market, Tower Bridge, and nearby sights, then returning to Victoria Station to pick up our luggage.
4. **Evening:** Plan to take a train to Gatwick and stay at a hotel there to simplify our early morning departure.

**Questions:**

* Does it make sense to stay at a Gatwick hotel for the night, or would it be better to stay closer to central London?
* Any recommendations for luggage storage locations near Victoria or other stations that would suit our itinerary?
* Route feedback: Is there a more efficient way to handle our travel plans or an alternative to carrying all our luggage around?

EU travel - London vs paris (2nd time),"Hello,
We have flight tickets booked for summer 2025 to fly in to London and leave from Amsterdam. It is a two week time period.
We have never been to Amsterdam and Belgium. So planning 5 days in Amsterdam and 3 days in Brussels/bruges.
We (30yr old couple) have been to both London and paris in 2017 and seen all the major sights as well as a trip to bath. Now we are visiting with our 4yr old and 1yr old and are wondering if just doing London is better when we land or go to Paris?

When we went in 2017 we were young kids free and we had long sightseeing days. This time we want to take it slow and just enjoy good food, parks and shopping and little bit sightseeing (like Big Ben, may be peppa pig bus tour :-) )

So the question is what would you recommend to pair with Brussels and Amsterdam for day 1- day 6
Day 1-6 -??
Day 7-9- Brussels/Belgium
Day 9-14- Amsterdam

"Inexperienced traveler, need advice on London itinerary","I'm going to London next month for 4 days (April 29 to May 2, leaving on May 3) and was looking for some advice on an itinerary. Below is my current itinerary based mostly on this [3-day one](https://independenttravelcats.com/3-days-in-london-itinerary/) with some changes here and there.

Times are based on estimates I've found online. I also assume a flat 30-minute travel time (unless otherwise stated) that I hope averages out, 30 minutes for breakfast at the hotel, and 1~ hour each for lunch and dinner.

My specific questions (though I'd appreciate advice outside of this as well):

1. I think the current version of this schedule is pretty tight (maybe impossible?) and doesn't account for slowdown from inexperience, losing track of time, eating, just wanting to stay at certain places for longer, etc. Which parts of this would be the most cutable?

2. Are there any must-sees that I'm missing here?

3. How does Sky Garden release tickets? I read somewhere that they release every Monday, but I couldn't find info on what time range they release for. I saw some available for 3 weeks from now (week of April 7), which makes me think that I should be on the lookout for tickets for my week starting on April 8th.

4. I haven't planned out food yet, but are there any that I should **avoid** or are otherwise overrated? I'm taking recommendations too of course, but it's easier to search for where to go than ""is this place secretly bad"" online.

**Day 1**: I expect to get to my hotel at around 10AM.

1. Buckingham Palace (for the changing of the guard and general sightseeing) [2 hours?]

2. Walk through St. James's Park to get to Parliament Square. [15 minutes]

3. Westminster Abbey [2 hours]

4. Palace of Westminster [1 hour]

5. Westminster Bridge [20/30 minutes]

**Day 2**:

1. British Museum [4 hours]

2. Will probably spend most of the day at the British museum, but if there's extra time: The National Gallery

3. Trafalgar Square [15 minutes]

**Day 3**:

1. Tower of London [4-5 hours]

2. Sky Garden (if I ever get a ticket) [1 hour]

3. St. Paul's Cathedral [1.5 hours]

4. The Shard (*only if I can't get a Sky Garden reservation*) [1 hour]

5. Tower Bridge [1 hour]

**Day 4**:

Looking for replacements for Kensington since it doesn't seem that great...would it be feasible to fit in Windsor Castle in the morning?

~~1. Kensington Palace [3 hours]~~

~~2. Kensington Gardens [3 hours]~~

3. Victoria & Albert Museum [2-3 hours]

4. Depending on the time, the Natural History and Science Museum, though I expect these visits to be brief. It just seems like a waste to not visit since it's so close to V&A.",12,36,1710964046.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bjmh9h/inexperienced_traveler_need_advice_on_london/,Empty-Ad1672
Is 7 days stay in london too long?,"My husband has a work trip to the uk 2 hours outside of London and we were thinking of flying together, stay in London then he'd go to work for 3 days then come back to spend the rest of the vacation together. 8 days total.

Heres where my struggle is; while looking at hotels in london i felt a bit down and suffocated thinking baby and i could be trapped in a big city for a week.
I looked at other hotels outside london with large outdoors and nature and that felt so much better my only concern is the distance to London (one hour plus).
So I guess i just want advice/ opinion for someone who enjoys the city but not nearly as much as nature. 
1) is there enough to see in London thats baby friendly and worth staying there for 7-8 days?
2) hows the public transportation is it safe for a mom and a baby alone? (Where we live public transportations are not safe at all)
3) would it be wiser to stay in london for half of the trip and outside it for the other half?

Help Me Choose: London + Paris + Italy or Norway + Sweden + Finland for a December Trip?,"hi everyone  
im planning a trip for **Dec 2025** and need some advice on which itinerary would be more worthwhile. duration is not yet confirmed but probably around 3 weeks. cities can be taken out if there is too much

# Option A: London + Paris + Italy (Rome and/or Venice)

I’m considering visiting these three iconic destinations because I love the idea of experiencing a blend of culture, history, and festive holiday vibes. I’ve heard that London and Paris are beautiful around Christmas, with their Christmas markets, lights, and decorations. In Italy, I’m particularly excited about seeing the historic sites in Rome and the romantic canals of Venice. I visited London and Paris before years ago, and it would be nice to revisit these countries.

Option B: Norway + Sweden + Finland

Alternatively, I’m drawn to the idea of experiencing Northern Europe. Unlike london and paris, i have never been to either of these countries. I’ve always wanted to see the Northern Lights, and I’ve heard that places like Sweden and Finland offer unique winter activities like dog sledding, snowmobiles. I’m hoping to also explore iconic cities like Oslo and Stockholm..

I’m not sure which option to choose, and I’d love to hear from anyone who’s visited these places during December or has any tips to make the most out of the winter travel experience.

End of March Trip to London,"Hi all, I am looking to get some recommendations for things to do while in London. I am not normally the type to ""plan"" however I really want to anchor down my plans while me and my girlfriend are there. We are traveling from America. Side note is that we are also visiting to potentially find out if we want to move here or the surrounding area. At least for the next few years. Are there neighborhood recommendations as well?  

  
We leave March 23rd but land on March 24th around 12:30PM. A bit later than what I normally would like but it was the best flight option available. I have plans to get tickets for us to go and see the England world cup qualifying match as she is a Tottenham fan and I a Brighton fan ( obviously there are no games for the international break but we did not want to miss an opportunity for an in-person experience.) We do not leave until the 31st around 9am. We are for sure wanting to go to seven sisters cliffs and also take a day trip to Brussels potentially as well. 

  
See some ideas I have created thus far down below. I understand a lot of people here ask about traveling to London and there are many great ideas already! I appreciate anything that anyone has to offer.



March 24th 2025

1. Land at London Heathrow Airport 12:10 PM
2. Go to Airbnb / unpack items and get ready for day
3. Borough Market walk around/shop Kith London
4. Grab lunch/dinner at Las Iguanas near Wembley Stadium 
5. Go to England world cup qualifying match at Wembley Stadium 7:45 Kick off time
6. Potentially go to a pub afterwards? 

  


March 25th 2025

1. Wake up between 7-8am
2. Eat breakfast at The Breakfast Club London Bridge 1 Southwark St, London SE1 1RQ, United Kingdom 9:00am
3. Head to London sky garden 10:30
4. After this go to tower bridge to see ( more so a quick sightseeing stop, could potentially figure out if there is more nearby to stay within the area) 12:00
5. Go to lunch at flesh and buns (41 Earlham St, London WC2H 9LX, United Kingdom) 12:45

Travelling from London to Milan via Amsterdam with a pet on KLM: my experience,"Hi fellow pet guardians!

Figured I'd share my experience on KLM flights (City Hoppers) with a pet, cos let's be honest we all need the information we can get when organizing a trip.

Important note: this is my esperience, not the rule!! Do take everything with a grain of salt. All you need is one member of staff in a bad mood, or someone really strict with rules, for stuff to go south, and you dont want to lose your flight on something dumb like rules.

Do your research and make sure you have plan B and C if you are not sure. FYI, I packed an extra carrier that had the right dimentions just in case they rejected the carrier, which was 4cm out in height.

Onwards to the actual info!



= Flights and Airline =

I flew with KLM, single booking for a double flight cos gods forbid I have a direct one straight to where I'd like to be.

 

= Carriers info =

Main carrier, M size: [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BVJ6HN4Y?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2&th=1)

Plan B carrier, M size: [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09PVF8DY6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)



= Pet info =

4.2kg of cat, 1y and 9 months, dimensions 50cm long head to tail fully stretched out, 25cm tall up to his back, 32 cm up to his head.

 

= Paperwork =

× AHC in Dutch and Italian (the point of entry and the destination- vet wasn't sure so I asked for both. Some charge extra for it, be careful)

× Fit to Fly certification

× Vaccination record

× Microchip certification

 

= Flights =

× Origin: London Heathrow (UK)

I arrived at the airport with Uber Pet. I had 2x suicases, a backpack and a cat, no way I'd take the tube to get there lol

I dropped off the suitcases, they asked me for the KLM paper for my cat, then sent me to security. They scanned my backpack and took my carrier with my cat. I assume they checked weight here, but I didnt see them doing that as I was still waiting for my backpack. They then brought me to a separate room to have the carrier checked. They asked me to take out my cat, cos they need to scan the carrier. So be prepared to hold your pet in your arms cos they dont have temporary carrier for your pet (sigh). Once they are satisfied, you can put your pet back into the carrier and off you go.

× Layover: Amsterdam Schiphol (NL)

Followed transfer route. At passport control they told me to go ahead and get my pet checked at customs. Customs was closed at 6pm lol. I asked another member of security, who checked with their manager, and told to me to just go to my gate as they'd check at customs in the country of arrival. Power walked to my next gate, which was 15 minutes away from my arrival gate. In total it took me around 40 minutes from touching NL ground to my next gate.

× Destination: Milan Linate (IT) 

Once cleared passport control, I went to Customs and both security staff told me there was no need to check my pet. So I exited the airport. I assume they didn’t check because at that point I was travelling EU to EU countries, so in their eyes there was no need to check the paperwork.



= Good to know =

× I've literally stopped anyone that looked even remotely staff to say I had a pet and looked as lost as possible to get help/directions/info out of them. It worked. I think it's due to how cute my cat looks. Weaponize it because it grants your fast line EVERYWHERE: baggage drop off, security, passport control.

× One hour connection in Amsterdam IS TIGHT. I power walked and got to my gate in time, but I was technically allowed to skip customs in this airport AND I made sure I was strategically positioned during my entire journey (booked a seat close to the front exist, stayed close to the bus exist to be the first to get off) to make the entire process as smooth as possible for myself.

× Have your AHC in multiple languages - because you might get asked to go through customs at every airport you land in.

× I strongly recommend getting the right specs for the carrier because the 25cm is LITERALLY the actual maximum height of seat in front of yours on KLM Cityhoppers. My main carrier DID NOT fit under the seat. However, both hostess who checked my seatbelt didn’t bat an eye, they just told me to not take my pet out under any circumstances- which, fair.

 

= TLDR =

All went smoothly, I think they checked the weight but not the carrier's dimension, nobody asked me the paperwork I carefully prepared. In hindsight, I overprepared, but it was worth it. It gave me the confidence and peace of mind to face this journey alone. Make with this what you will :)

 Good luck on your flights and may it be as smooth as mine!",16,1,1740130718.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1iun4wg/travelling_from_london_to_milan_via_amsterdam/,Intrepid_Reaction_17

Christmas in London Update,"I received some great advice on travelling to London during the Christmas holidays and would like to give back a little for those wanting to go in the future.  

We arrived on Christmas eve and it only took us about 30 mins to make from the plane to baggage claim and another 40 mins to our apartment (Booking.com) in Covent Gardens.  The location was great with easy access to the tube - Embankment ( yellow/green/black lines) & Leicester (blue line).   We hit a pub Christmas eve (reserved a table in advance) & had a nice time unwinding.  I was really surprised at how busy it was with every pub packed with people.

Christmas day we had a river cruise lunch planned that left from Westminster Pier.  I was gobsmacked at how many people were out and about.  You would never have known it was Christmas day.  The tourist hop on/off busses were all running full of people.  There were lines of 25+ or so of people taking pics in a red phone booths w/ Big Ben in the background.  We later went to Chinatown for dinner and, again, lines out the door to all the  restaurants.  All were offering a ""special menu"" (same menu with 50%+ surcharge) or they had a sign that just said ""Prices doubled for today"".  The food all looked/tasted ""meh"" but most other restaurants were closed or offered a Prix Fixed Christmas menu at really inflated prices.

We did the typical tourist activities which were all great but the feedback we kept getting was how unusually busy it was.  Borough Mkt was uncomfortably crowed (think leaving a concert level crowded). The Christmas lights were nice to see but nothing stunning.  Harrods was absolutely packed with shoppers.  Even with the crazy crowds though, we were able to get into the British Museum with no reservations with about a 15 min wait.

We ordered Oyster cards in advance and used about $25.  The tube was easy to navigate we never felt unsafe.  We really enjoyed London and loved the ""international"" feel of the city but I would not go back  again during this time of year.  Once was enough.

Edit: Before I forget,  I LOVED the hotness of the coffee! Like, it was prelawsuit level of hotness which was fantastic! ",64,32,1704315135.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18xtqwt/christmas_in_london_update/,jpak02

Trip ideas from London (November),"Hi 

I have 5-10 days annual leave booked for the end of this month and struggling for ideas on where to go flying from around London.  Would prefer somewhere reasonably warm, maybe beaches/hikes and flight less than 8 hours ideally direct.

Possibilities so far, Egypt/Jordan, or Oman/UAE (been to dubai too often).  I also went to Dom Rep refently which was 7/8 hours direct otherwise somewhere like that would be an option..

Can anyone think of other places…EU would be cold but maybe parts of Spain..

Thanks",1,13,1730637818.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gilzvz/trip_ideas_from_london_november/,Puzzleheaded_Wish330
Easiest way to get to the Bordeaux from London,"Hi all, please advise,
We are having a direct flight to London LHR in one month and I need to get to Bordeaux during our 6 days getaway. 
Planning to stay couple days in the center of London and 3-4 days in Bordeaux. Flying back home from LHR as well.
The problem is there are no direct flights from LHR to Bordeaux (only from LGW). There are also no direct trains to Bordeaux as well.
How should I make it work the easiest way?

1. Fly from LHR to Bordeaux the same arrival day (with one connection either Paris or Amsterdam) and get back to London on the train with connection in Lille? Since the train station in London is located close to the center where we will be staying, it’ll make it faster for us to get to the hotel and enjoy the rest of the days in London.
There are no direct flights from LGW to Bordeaux the day of our arrival to LHR to make it work with our connection. One flight in the morning and we will land at a later time so we can’t make it.
Flying the next day after our arrival from LGW is possible but we would loose a whole trip day and would probably have to stay somewhere close to the airport which is not much fun.

2. Or should we head from LHR to the hotel in downtown, spend couple days there and use the train to Bordeaux? On the way back we would fly back to London LGW(very early morning flight), change to LHR and fly back home to USA(it’ll be 7h connection between both flights). What if the flight from Bordeaux get cancelled and we won’t make to our main flight? Is it worth the hassle? If we fly to LGW the day before, we would have to spend a night  close to the airport and loose the day.
Stressing too much before the trip and need to make plans and reservations🤦🏼‍♀️🫣

What are the 5 most romanticised cities in the world?,"The cities that everyone has seen in movies or on TV dozens of times, that keep drawing people in (for better or worse), and at this point basically sell themselves as top destinations?

I'd say:

Paris

London

NYC

Rome

Dubai (more of a modern inclusion)

Romanticized doesn't mean romantic, it's just making idealised views of something, having a perfect idea of said thing which may not reflect reality.",721,873,1700493033.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17zqmwo/what_are_the_5_most_romanticised_cities_in_the/,tylerthe-theatre
Are there big south american cities that are very safe (close to good europeans cities like London)?,"I've been to Quito. The city was nice to visit, the food was great, but the security was a disaster. 
Lot of drunk people fighting, we saw more robberies there in few days that in UK + Germany in years.

For people that are more experienced about south america (that have been personally there), are there big cities (with international airport) that are particularly safe?

Amsterdam/London to Sydney - plans and stops,"Hi all

I need to go to Sydney for a wedding next October. I'm not sure where I'll be living but London and Amsterdam are safe options to book flights from, with Amsterdam being the preferred option as I've family there I can stay with. I'd like to see some of Aus over 3/4 weeks so don't mind flying to Perth, Melbourne etc and making my way over.

What I'd like to know is what's the best way to get over to Aus? If I can book a nice day/night in the likes of Shanghai, Hong Kong or Singapore I'd be very keen on that.",0,13,1730499251.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ghhf8o/amsterdamlondon_to_sydney_plans_and_stops/,pockkler

Jet Lag Sydney / London Urgent 🚨,"Title: Flying London → Sydney for 10 Days, Back on Feb 28—Will I Be Fresh for Work on March 4?

Hey all,

I’m planning a trip from London to Sydney, leaving Feb 17 at 9 PM or 8 AM Feb 18 and returning Feb 27 at 9 PM, landing back in London on Feb 28 around midday. My first day at a new job is on March 4, so I’ll have 4 full days to recover from jet lag before work.

Plan for Beating Jet Lag:
	•	Feb 28 (Landing Day): No naps, stay active, get sunlight, gym/run, cold plunge, early night.
	•	Feb 29 - March 2: Full routine (gym, run, cold plunge, caffeine), staying active, no late caffeine, early nights.
	•	March 3: Final prep—same routine, early night before day 1.

The Question:

If I stick to this plan 100%, how fresh will I feel for work on March 4? Any tips from people who’ve done similar long-haul trips?",0,2,1739692427.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1iqncnq/jet_lag_sydney_london_urgent/,Ok_Pomegranate_5292
Does anyone find South America unironically more expensive than Europe?,"After having been in these two continents, I was overviewing my expenses in both of them and I realize I actually tend to spend more in South America compared to Europe.  Some of my observations so far:

1. Public transport in Europe is so good.  I can get from places to places so easily just from a quick Google Maps search to find the next available train.  In much of South America, I still have to depend on taxis, tour buses and domestic fights to get from location to location.  I know there are metros in the major cities in South America as well, but it gets a bif iffy sometimes so I still feel more secure taking a taxi in these cities.  This is sort of linked to my second point.
2. It's of no surprise that crime levels in South America is quite a lot higher compared to Europe.  This means that for unexperienced travelers, you might want to pay for private tours to do certain activities if you don't want to be constantly on the lookout.  Europe has it's fair share of pickpockets, but by and large I still find it quite comfortable walking down the streets as long as I keep my belongings secured with me.
3. I also find the general prices of things in South America, in the places tourists will go, tend to be quite on par with Europe.  For example in Rio, I find most of the restaurants along Copacabana and Ipanama at about USD20-25 per pax, which is really not all that different from central London and Paris.  I know you can probably find more affordable prices the further you stray from the tourists places, but the areas start to get shady quite quickly which again goes back to my second point.

Just some of my 2cents.  Really interested to see what other people who's being to both of these regions think.",378,226,1743908098.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jskg1d/does_anyone_find_south_america_unironically_more/,Xycergy
One week in Europe. Should I do Amsterdam/Berlin or Amsterdam/London?,"First time I’m (25M) traveling to Europe for a week at the end of this year. I was able to score a decent flight to Amsterdam.
