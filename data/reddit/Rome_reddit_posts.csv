Wizz air left my 14 year old alone in Rome because of overbooking,"Today my son was travelling home from a sport camp in Italy with Wizz air. Due to a problem with online check-in he had to go to the check-in desk and pay extra for checking in there. He did not get assigned a seat. When he told me this I thought he would surely get one at the gate.

Once boarding was finished he was told he was bumped off due to overbooking. Over the phone the staff at the gate told me they could give us €250 compensation and sort accommodation until their next flight to Iceland… which leaves in a week! His coach was given the option to volunteer her seat and accept the minimal compensation and the same deal - which would have meant her leaving the rest of the group (which included children younger than him).

They offered absolutely no help in getting him on another flight the same day… and no understanding of how grave the situation was, to leave a 14 year old alone stranded in a foreign country. They just kept saying that they didn’t know how old he was!

Luckily there was a family bumped off too who offered to take care of him. I booked him on the only flight available home today (which cost a fortune)

He will be home soon but I am so lost for words…

EDIT: for those of you interested in how the trip was organized and things to say about the coach please find answers in comments. For all intents and purposes my could have been travelling alone. He was travelling on a solo ticket (like many kids do and he has done before to see his grandparents abroad) to an international sports camp which offered pick up and drop off to the airport. The coach from our local club chaperoning was faced with this situation at the gate. I just feel lucky she was there. She also had responsibility for the other kids in the group. 

When I spoke to the family who offered to take care of him I told the coach to go with the group not to leave them unaccompanied. 

Of course we should not have booked Wizz air. Which is why I am here warning others. ",4286,441,1723312751.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1eoz89l/wizz_air_left_my_14_year_old_alone_in_rome/,Silly-Turnip-8547

Rome for the first time with my parents - blatant racism was disappointing,"My boyfriend and I invited my parents to visit Rome with us. They live in the USA and have never traveled to Europe before (I grew up poor because my parents were in phd and post-doc programs that took awhile and we never had the means to travel). They were both so excited because traveling to Europe was their dream. I now make enough money to spoil them (and I have to do it soon as they are getting older) and we all couldn’t sleep from excitement the weeks leading up to this trip.

When my mom saw the Trevi Fountain, she burst into tears because she never thought she’d make it to Rome in her life time. This was despite the crazy heat and throngs of tourists pushing against her. She was so happy to just be here. My dad also could not stop taking photos and looking around in awe. He is normally very stoic but he was so amazed by the sceneries that it cracked his normal quiet demeanor.

However, on our last couple of days we experienced some awful racism that ruined our trip. 

The first incident happened in Trastevere. We were going up a street that lead to an outlook. On that street, there was a man leaning against the railing facing in the sidewalk. There were many people in front of us also going up that sidewalk. However, when he saw my mom about to walk past him, he pulled out his mask and put it on while giving her major side eye and a general look of disgust. This confused my mom because there was a huge group that passed him minutes ago, but they were all white. My mom is Asian. He didn’t put on his mask for the non-Asian tourists passing him.

I saw this all happen and asked him why he did that in English as my mom was extremely upset. His wife, sitting across from him leapt up and started screaming at us to “go away” and calling us crazy bitches over and over again. My mom and I didn’t raise our voices at all so this behavior seemed really defensive and rude overall. She kept yelling at us and getting up in our faces that we walked away eventually. However, it truly made us feel crappy and unwelcome in this country / city. The subtle way this man looked at my mom and put on his mask, the gaslighting for calling US crazy were quiet forms of micro aggression and racism that hurt like hell. 

The second incident happened at a grocery store near the colosseum. My dad and I went to grab some vegetables. We didn’t realize that we were supposed to weigh our vegetables ourselves to get the price. During checkout, the cashier looked at the cucumber we bought and told us to “get a number.” We didn’t realize she meant weight so we gave her a produce number. She rolled her eyes and threw the cucumber aside and said under her breath “stupid Chinese.” She never put the cucumber back. She then asked us to pay and my dad inserted his card. She told him to sign. He was reaching to sign, but then she slapped his hand away and forged his signature herself while rolling her eyes and calling us stupid Chinese again. I asked what was with her attitude and she looked at me and said “I don’t understand your English.” Which is absurd because I was born in Wisconsin lol.

Other incidents like these happened too, but they were less blatant and egregious. We were so excited to be here but now we are just sad and feel unwelcome.

We are going to Florence next week but it’s hard to feel excited. Instead I have major anxiety about getting treated poorly because we are Asian. Is this normal behavior in Italy?",2198,811,1662834201.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xawa16/rome_for_the_first_time_with_my_parents_blatant/,mochi_donuts414
I just had my phone stolen in the Rome metro,"tl;dr Never keep your phone, wallet or anything of value in your pockets.

I'm writing this because this is my first time getting pickpocketed and I've always wondered how they actually do it. Now I know, so I'm offering you the chance to learn from my mistake, since just telling someone ""You should watch your stuff in the metro"" doesn't actually work.

The setup:

1. The scene of the crime is the metro station at the platform where you're actually getting on the train.
2. You need several people. In my case, I think 4 were involved.
3. The victim needs to hold a phone or a wallet in any of their pockets. I had my phone in my front right pocket of slim fit jeans.

The execution:

1. Wait for the victim to start getting onto the train.
2. Two people follow it closely behind. Another two cut fast in front of it.
3. The two in the front stop right at the doors and make a dramatic gesture like ""Oh no, this is the wrong train"".
4. The two in the front start exiting the train, but in a way that they are blocking you from getting in and pushing you out instead. The two at the back push you forward, so you're sandwiched between all four of them.
5. While you're getting pushed from all sides, one of them slips his hand into your pocket. At this time you can hear the sound signal that the train doors are about to close.
6. They all move off the train, you hurry onto the train, the doors close.

You have a total of 2 seconds to react at most, so if you're not expecting it, it's almost impossible to notice it right then and there.

If you're traveling to Rome... Be careful which luggage storage to use.,"I travel a lot... I've used luggage storage facilities in several countries.  Never have I been so violated as to when I went out of Rome *Fiumicino Airport (FCO)... Stored my luggage overnight (Terminal 3) near* the buses\*.. ..And,\* myself and a friend dropped off our luggage, we *hopped* over *to AMS for an overnight trip... and silly me thinking it was* safe to leave my small laptop inside my luggage.

The luggage was scanned, they took my passport, I'd never had issues before with any other luggage facility.  Then, viola when I get back from AMS and checked my luggage... Laptop and a few other small items were taken.  The language barrier didn't help but ofc they denied it, and said, (if this really happened, then you need to file a report. I won't go into the details of all the running around they sent me on.  Left Rome and communicated with Police and Airport officials for them via email for a month.. Explaining the to them where my MacBook Pro was located. The smirk on their faces when I explained it told me immediately--- I wasn't getting it back, and it seemed as if this was not anything they had not heard before.  So, do yourself a favor.. Never store your luggage where there are people manning the facility, always used the ones that have a lock and key or code.  Thank goodness, my renters insurance covered my laptop, and I had backed up a few days before.  Im calm now, but going through it was a nightmare...

"African American Women in Rome, Racism Yes, but Mainly Positive","Here in Rome for 3 days before embarking on a cruise with my mom and teenage daughter around the Mediterranean.  I know people are traveling here frequently and have some fears around racism abroad so I thought I'd share our experiences in Rome.  

I'll get the negative experiences out of the way first. We went on a food tour through Trastevere. There was 8 of us plus our Italian tour guide. Everyone was white except us. As we were walking through a crowd of young Italian males (probably early 20s), one of them says the word ""Monkey"", out of nowhere in English. We were at the end of the line in our tour so I don't think anyone else in our group heard.  I was so shocked that I actually questioned myself for about 5 minutes whether I actually heard that. But I did. A feeling of sadness began to settle over me. I did some mental and emotional wrestling and decided to not let a miserable racist person have that affect on me. I feel like it's letting them win, it's giving them what they want. If my mom or daughter heard it, they didn't say anything and neither did I.  We didn't discuss it with each other. This is my first time discussing this.  So that happened, but by the time we started tasting food, I was distracted enough to move past it and enjoy our tour.  


On the flip side, a hotel clerk at a hotel we weren't staying in saved the day when she let me use her personal adapter to charge my phone for 20 minutes. It died and I had no idea how to get to the meet up spot for our tour.  After going to a grocery store and a restaurant where no one could (or would) help, she did that and was so sweet and gracious about it.  Everyone at the hotel was very friendly towards us as we cooled off, got water and waited while my phone charged. Since we weren't staying there, I was worried how they might treat us but everything was cool.  

I would describe customer service as nuetral. Not overly friendly (but sometimes).  The only other questionable thing was today when the meetup person ( not our guide) for the Colosseum turned their back to me and my daughter as I approached them to check in.  I said ""Ciao, scusi,  we need to check in please"". He turned around and apologized profusely and checked us in and apologized more. All the apologizing made me think he turned his back on us on purpose and maybe it was a race thing but I'm not sure.  

We've sat in quite a few restaurants and had mid to great experiences.  All of our tour guides were fantastic. Rome itself is a true site to see with so much history it's all mind blowing. 

As far as pick pockets and hustlers are concerned, just keep your head on a swivel.  At the Termini train station we were definitely targeted. We were super obvious tourists looking extremely confused and weak trying to figure out how to buy tickets to Trastevere and then back to the airport. People kept approaching us, calling us ""sister"" and at first my mom kept being too nice and interacting with everyone. She bought a scarf 😩 at the Vatican. But after that she just kept quiet while I said no thanks no thanks to everyone. But they are SUPER PERSISTENT. This guy literally threw a ""free"" bracelet at my daughter after we kept refusing it. We just let it hit the ground and kept moving. 

My advice is to not be surprised if someone is blatantly racist towards you if you're black. But also don't let that stop you from coming here. Why should racist people get what they want and prevent us from living our best life?

Another thing that happened is that a tourist from Kazakhstan was filming us as we were eating dinner at a food court type place at the airport. My mom, caught her and said ,""why are you recording us? Please stop it right now"" to which she replied, ""I'm from kazakhstan"" and keeps recording us. My mom then says ""ok. you need to stop filming us right now"" Then the lady comes over and the woman she's FaceTiming tells my mom , ""I'm from kazakhstan"". Before my mom totally loses it, I said to the lady, ""You're being rude, it doesn't matter where you're from, please leave us alone, and stop recording us right now."" She finally walks away. That was wild. But not an uncommon experience when traveling while black. So many people have no idea how to act when they see people who don't look like them and everyone else where they're from. They start treating you like you're an exhibit at the museum. 

So we're leaving tomorrow. I have mixed feelings because it's been ""a lot"" in both good and bad ways. I'd like to come back in the slow season though. The positive experiences heavily outweighed the negative. There's so much we didn't get to see. We're on to France, Tunisia, Greece, Malta and Spain next. Wish us good luck and please share any experiences you've had in those places so I'll know what to expect. Thanks in advance.

A week in Rome,"These pictures are from February of this year: the Forum, Galeria Borghese, Circus Maximus, Mercato Testaccio, the Forum (from the POV of Palatine Hill), St. Peter’s Basilica, Capitoline Museum, and Piazza Navona. The other pics were just cool shots from around Monti, Testaccio, and one of the bridges across the Tiber.

Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised how manageable the crowds were given the Jubilee year. The busiest attractions were Trevi Fountain and the Vatican Museums, but even then, I don’t imagine that it was much more crowded than how it is during peak season any other year. 

I stayed for 9 days / 8 nights including a day trip, and I think that was plenty of time to see most things at our leisure, take side quests to explore without feeling rushed, and have a couple slow days to just eat, drink, and shop. We probably could’ve hit more things that were lower on our list, but at a certain point it’s easy to get a little history and culture overload that makes it difficult to appreciate everything to the full extent. For example, the Capitoline was great in its own right but paled in comparison to the Borghese and Vatican galleries that we went to during other parts of the trip. Same with different ruins and historical sites; I knew there was more to see, but after seeing the most popular spots and a day trip to Pompeii, we weren’t really motivated to see the things that were further out or cost money (the Appian Way, Baths of Caracalla, etc). Both my friend and I do expect to come back to Rome someday though. 

I came home with some leather goods and a moka pot. I found that my boots and the Bialetti cost roughly the same as in the US, but no-name brand purses from the touristy leather shops around town felt like a deal. For €134, I got two handbags and a wallet, so given it being real leather, I feel like that’s pretty good compared to what’s available to me at home for the same price.

If I had to do it again, I’d probably book a multi-city plane ticket rather than a round trip one and take the train to add another city in, but it was still a great trip!",1837,40,1744644556.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jz1p26,JCOhMyBuddha

Pervert ruined Rome for my family,"I've seen a few posts bagging on Italy (esp Rome) lately and I thought I'd share my story. Last summer, I took my family to Rome because my daughters were getting old enough to truly appreciate what had been my favorite city on earth. It was way hotter and more crowded than I've ever seen it, but we tried to find some quieter places.

On day 3, we decided to watch the sunset from the top of the Vittoriano - it was almost deserted and we sat for 15 minutes just taking it all in. Suddenly a woman started screaming ""Get your children out of here!!"" and I gathered my girls to me, but we were at the top of a couple of hundred stone steps and I didn't want anyone to get hurt running down.

The woman kept screaming, and my 9 year old was panicking. She starts yelling ""get the fuck out of here"" and I honestly had no idea if she was a threat, or what was happening. Then I see a shabby older Italian man start running down the stairs. The bastard had crept up behind my preteen daughters, exposed himself and started masturbating, and this wonderful woman was aware enough to know what was happening and confront him.

We thanked her, but probably not enough, since my attention went immediately to my girls. I tried to explain that the man was just a crazy guy, and they were now safe. After they calmed down, I was filled with rage, and wished nothing more than a chance to meet the bastard with a 9 iron in my hand.

The truly heartbreaking part was the nightmares that my youngest had for the next few nights. We couldn't wait to get out of Rome and I don't know that any of us will ever go back there. I hope, if the bastard ever tried that again, another father gave him what he deserves until he takes his place in hell.

Rome experience,"I’m 22F, on a trip with my 26F sister. We came to Rome this morning, and after dinner tonight, we went to the colosseum to click some photos. we were literally minding our own business when two young girls purposely bumped into us to pick up a fight. 
It was clear that their intention was to harass, but it was especially disturbing because it was they were so young and were women. Not only were they chasing us down the road, they were saying some pretty racist shit and abusing us in Italian. Mind you, it was 9:30pm on a Friday night in front of the colosseum. 
Women, and men, please be safe! This experience made us feel really unsafe and uncomfortable and really spoilt our mood. Coming from Bombay/Paris, I’ve never felt so unsafe. 
I get that there are weird and racist people everywhere, but I was especially blindsided because I didn’t expect a pair of 15/16 year olds to make me feel like that. Uncomfortable, unsafe, and extremely scared.

My husband and I had the most friendly conversation with a random couple in an ice-cream shop in rome,"Me and my husband are Saudis We were in Rome may 2022 the weather was extremely hot (almost like back home)
we thought we sit down and relax inside a nice touristy ice cream shop. There was only 1 table free left we took it

Few minutes later a couple reached to us (white couple) and asked if they can sit with us we welcomed them. the guy quickly opened a conversation with my husband about where we’re from and what places have we been one topic to another we talked for 2 hours. He was very interested about my hijab situation because i was not wearing a hijab. His wife was shy and didn’t really ask anything while he definitely had opinions and concerns towards hijab 

I never had a conversation with foreigners except in The gulf region and because my country and culture is judged and hated so much in the media it got me thinking the whole world either hates me or feels sorry for me 

It was interesting to see the cultural differences in our routine in Rome while my husband and I were much younger they were way more active and did way more walking and we did more eating and shopping lol

"A week in Rome, February 2025","February was a perfect time to explore the city. It was in the high 50s or even 60 degrees most days. Some days we didn’t even need coats as long as we had a sweatshirt or sweater on. The crowds were only really bad at the really famous sights, but we alleviated that as best we could by booking the earliest entry tickets we could get.  Usually 8am.  We had a great Airbnb right near the Tiber River across from Castel San Angelo in a quiet area with fun alleyways to explore along with plenty of shops, gelato and cafes. Walking distance to pizza navona, Vatican City, the Pantheon, Spanish steps, trevi fountain, as well as a taxi stand to take us anywhere else we couldn’t walk to.  Prices were very reasonable for eating and sightseeing.  Roman cuisine is excellent. The pastas. The organ meats. Cheap wine (10 euro for a liter of house wine). 

I visited Rome 25 years ago after college and I loved it even more the 2nd time as did my wife and kids who were on their first visit.    A week was enough for us, we did heavy sightseeing in the mornings, then would break for lunch and head back to apartment to relax before an afternoon walk to get gelato of do some light sightseeing.   You could certainly do everything in say, 3 days, but we didn’t want such a grueling pace. We did take a separate day trip to Pompeii and Naples one day.  I will post photos of that separately.

Rome when the Pope passes,"Please forgive any insensitivity in this question, I’m purely curious and trying to game plan.

I have a Rome trip booked in the near future, including Vatican City tour. With the Pope’s health, and not wishing anything negative to happen, but he is quite old and on a ventilator.. If the worst case occurs, what is it like in Rome? 

Has anyone on here experienced Rome during or shortly after the passing of a Pope? Are pilgrims to the Vatican coming in advance to be there or pray before? Are there Masses that begin in the square? If/when it happens, do huge crowds flock to Rome? 

Again, sorry for any insensitivity, we wish him healing and a quick recovery- but as a non catholic and visitor, I’m looking to understand a bit more of how this will look for the city if he passes.",378,61,1740872874.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1j1db9j/rome_when_the_pope_passes/,more_brunch_please

"How to keep belongings safe in crowded tourist spots in Rome, Italy?","I’m planning a trip to Rome for 8 days this May with my wife, and I’ve been researching ways to avoid pickpockets(especially our phone!) in crowded tourist areas like the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, and Vatican. I’ve read that keeping belongings secure and close to your body is key, and some recommend anti-theft bags or clothing with hidden pockets.

[Italy was being ranked #1](https://preview.redd.it/879j221aflae1.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=a753e5e647f57a29b6165e3694c77c669e656feb)

My wife suggests using phone straps, especially since she often has her hands full with her shoulder bag and camera. I’m skeptical and wonder if they’re worth it. Have you used phone straps while traveling? Did they make a difference?

Also, for those who’ve been to Rome, which specific tourist spots or scenarios should I be especially mindful of? And what strategies worked best for keeping your belongings safe?

Am I just overthinking this?

OK to skip Rome?,"I’m planning on visiting Italy from April 4-9. I’ve found that when I solo travel, I dislike big cities and crowded places ( I really disliked Kyoto for example) For that reason I decided to rent a car and go to Abruzzo instead of the traditional Rome itinerary. 

I was making a plan for the day I fly out to spend in Rome , and started getting very intrigued. The more I learned about Rome, the more I wanted to do it instead of my countryside escape. 

I’d like some feedback from people who don’t like crowds, and how they felt with Rome overall. Likewise, people who have visited Abruzzo, how is the that side of the Italian countryside? 

I’m very indecisive, and need some help making this decision! Thank you!

We have our honeymoon booked. Flying into Barcelona July 16, and home from Rome July 30. These are direct flights at least. We would spend a couple days in those respective cities, and then probably a bit of time in Girona and/or Amalfi coast, etc.

Are Barcelona, and even more so Rome going to be too crowded (and hot) this time of year? Especially due to Jubilee in Rome?

How to avoid a huge fine on busses in Rome - always check the location of the ticket machine before you board,"
Before you board, always check which door has a ticket validator machine, especially on packed lines. We went to the Vatican on line 64 and the bus was so packed, you could not move an inch. We hopped on through the middle door, I saw the ticket machine in the front. I wanted to give my and my wife's ticket to a man in front of the machine to validate it for us. He said the one in the front was only for purchasing, the valdiating machine is only at the back - a place that was impossible to reach. Just 2 stops before the Vatican, when a bunch of people exited and finally we had the chance to validate, two inspectors hopped on, blocking the way - we got fined 54.90 euro each for not having a valid ticket. Having only one validation machine on the bus is extremely idiotic, given how packed these busses are. So before you board a fully packed bus, you should always check where the ticket machines are.

If you don't have a ticket, and want to purchase it on the bus - front door

If you already have a phisycal paper ticket that needs validation - back door

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: there might be some misunderstanding here. The problem is not that the tickets need to be validated, nor that the middle door is supposed to be for exit only. The problem is that ticket validation is completely impossible, when you can only do so at one end of the bus while on certain lines the number of people riding the bus clearly exceeds the capacity of the vehicle by a great margin.

How We Got Through My Dad's Coma in Rome,"Hello all, 

Just a little less than one month ago while on vacation in Rome, Italy, my dad suffered a kidney failure.  He was admitted into the intensive care unit at the Ospedale Isola Tiberina on 8/19/24.  I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1expku0/my_dad_is_in_the_icu_at_ospedale_isola_tiberina/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1exnoq3/my_dad_is_in_the_icu_at_ospedale_isola_tiberina/) on r/rome and r/travel

When the incident happened, I was at a loss because I had no idea how I could provide support to my mom while she was away in Rome and I was in Los Angeles.  My passport was not updated.  

I posted to Reddit in a panic mainly looking to how my mom could be supported during that time.  My mom would effectively be alone within 3 days, she did not speak Italian, she did not know how to get around except via Taxi which was around $20 a ride, her hotel, a Best Western was $170 a night, she needed her own meds.    
  
Long story short, my mom got through with it from my sister and I communicating with their travel insurance company, help with connections her sister had in Rome, my brother-in-law, and me being able to make a trip to Rome.  My dad was able to improve from being in a coma for about one week to walking through LAX on 9/12/24 (with assistance) 

As we were experiencing this situation, my mom, sister, and I would talk about different things from Reddit that she could try.    
  
This post is essentially about what worked and what might've been helpful to know at the time.  


* **Buying the insurance when buying their plane tickets for ITA airways was the single most important thing they did.**  We ended up emailing FALCK or whoever Generali Global Assistance. The company helped contact my dad's medical insurance, Kaiser, who helped fund his hospital stay and helped make arrangements.  This did take lots and lots of follow-up, emails, and coordination with my sister and me**.**    
* **Make sure to leave usernames and passwords somewhere people can access.**   My dad is better and once he woke up he tried using his phone but essentially locked himself out of his iPhone.  He can't remember his apple username, password.  As I type this out, I still need to help him figure this out.  However, my sister and I were able to help pay bills on their mortgage, electricity, gas, cable, etc, and put to rest any concerns my mom and dad had while being away.  At least my dad was organized enough with his bills that we could assist.  
* **My mother got the majority of help navigating Rome from one of her sister's connections in Rome.**  This individual was able to help my mother use the Roma Atac and pointed her towards neighborhoods from which they would be able to affordably commute to the hospital.  Previous to this, she would travel via taxi.  
* **Based on learning how to commute, My brother-in-law's internet savvy helped them locate a really good AirBnB that limited their housing and transportation costs.**  My brother-in-law bought an **e-SIM Card (Airalo)** which helped my mom do Messenger while at the hospital and generally anywhere in the city.  When my mom's friends left, she was faced with the prospect of finding a more affordable place to stay.  The stay at Best Western cost them $170-200 a night.  For 20 days, they were able to find an AirBnB at around a cost of $2400+.  Included were things that they were able to do to carry on as if they were living in the city --- washing clothes, light cooking, dishes.  It was an absolute steal.
* **The translation app and Google translate is what helped one of the Italian-speaking doctors communicate with us.**  Translation was one of the biggest hurdles in the management of my dad's case, as my parents speak English and Tagalog with a handful of fluent English speakers who would be there about 50% of the time.  My mom had the translate app on her iPhone but she wanted my brother-in-law and me to be there using those apps and communicating some things with the doctor and staff.  Only towards the end of our stay did she begin using the translate app on her phone.  Based on Reddit suggestions, my mom really looked hard for the ufficina di stranieri and the US consulate but did not find any ufficina at the Ospedale Isola Tiberina and the US Consulate simply said she could hire a translator.      
* **To get my own expired US passport updated, I got the best response and a lightning-quick response from emailing my local congressman. I** emailed my local congressperson under life-or-death emergency on a Friday, who set up an appointment for me the next-coming Monday.   I was able to get a passport by Weds.  The turn-around time to physically getting a Passport was 3 days!  If I would have known the turn-around time, I would have left earlier.  
* **The Lime Scooters and Bikes are kind of costly, but did make moving around the city a little easier for me.**  I was able to find cheaper and higher-quality food than the McDonalds that they became accustomed to during their stay.  Special shouts to that restaurant **Walk to Wok.**   
* **I took a leave of absence from my work doing my best to communicate the situation with them.**  At the time I requested a leave of absence my dad was still not awake, but there was hope that he was gaining consciousness and awareness of my mother's presence.  I committed to working at least a week and then gave myself about 3 weeks to get it sorted out. My employer requested not only a doctor's note, but had their own leave of absence form.  About 2 or 3 nights that I had gotten there, I spent a long night on my iPhone's Translator app trying to explain all the questions on the form they wanted the doctors to sign.  I even wrote a letter communicating that this letter was critical for my employer.  I was able to get the forms signed by these doctors in Italy!",412,58,1726308931.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fgixe8/how_we_got_through_my_dads_coma_in_rome/,bweapons

Got robbed 5 mins after arriving at our air bnb..,"

Hey everyone, I’m absolutely devastated and just need to share what happened. My friend and I were super excited about our trip to Palermo, Italy—one of our much-anticipated stops. We got to our Airbnb, and our host was super nice, showed us around, and everything seemed perfect.

But when the airbnb hosts asked for our passport I went to car to grab it and I saw our fully filled back compartment completly empty. We’re now looking at a 9-hour drive to Rome to get to the embassy and try to sort this mess out.

One of our theories is that someone was following us around for about 10 minutes before we got to the Airbnb. They must have seen how full our back compartment was. The moment we parked, they smashed the window to pieces and grabbed our bag. The doors were locked, but that didn’t stop them.

I have no idea what to do. The stuff in that bag… it’s just so hard to even imagine it’s all gone. I’m at a complete loss for words right now.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? What did you do? Any advice on how to handle this would be so appreciated. We’re just trying to figure out our next steps.

Is three days in Rome enough if I skip the Vatican? ,"After reading everyone's comments it sounds like I should visit the Vatican and see St. Peter's Basilica. I'm still undecided if I want to get the full museum tour. Starting to think I should do 3 full days in rome and leave venice for another trip and see if I can fit in Pompeii and maybe Amalfi.

I'm planning a 7-day trip to Italy, and I'm having trouble deciding how much time to spend in Rome and Venice and if I can squeeze in Pompeii.

"City for solo travel as a 40f - Rome or Paris? Looking for somewhere I can feel safe walking around alone, eat great food, and try to stay on a low-ish budget.","Context: I've lived in Germany for over a decade. My cousin and uncle are doing a trip to Europe for her 16th birthday, and I want to meet up with them along their journey for a couple of days since it's close by (which they are totally cool with). Two of their destinations are Paris and Rome, neither of which I've been to before. My husband will be staying home with our kid, so I'm travelling solo, which I actually really enjoy.

My uncle and cousin are pretty much booked up during their days with tours and day trips, so I'll mostly just see them for breakfast and/or dinner each day. Either way, it's a weekend in July.

Travel and hotel costs from where I live are pretty comparable. I'm wondering which city will be more worth it to explore on foot, and to eat my way through. I could do either a Fri-Sun in Paris, or a Sat-Tues in Rome. Mostly I'm interested in the food and architecture, but might hit an art museum, or do a cheesy hop-on-hop-off bus thing (they're kind of silly, but I really enjoyed the one I did in Madrid years ago).

I probably won't be able to afford hotels super close to where my family is staying - it's last minute, and they have a bigger budget for sure - so I also want to stay somewhere where I'll feel safe walking alone at night.

Weigh in! What city would you choose, and why? Bonus points for good tips on your chosen city, especially cheap/free cultural experiences!

Trying to decide between a couple of days in either Athens or Rome,"The place I'll be flying from has similar flight ticket prices for both places. 

  
I'm only going to be able to stay for 2 or 3 nights max, if it was any longer and I definitely would just go to Rome cause it's a bigger city. 

  
Quite frankly I don't know much about Rome. The only reason I got excited about Athens is that I really like Greek history and food (not very into Italian food), but I'm worried there just isn't much to do in Athens.

  
I'd take it Athens is probably cheaper than Rome once there too? 

  
I'm curious if anyone's been two both and can offer insights on how to choose between one or the other. I",10,48,1743535194.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jp47ub/trying_to_decide_between_a_couple_of_days_in/,agarijones

5 day travel to Rome in July,"Hello! I am travelling to Rome with my girlfriend and 2-3 others for 5 days in late July (sunday to friday). The others have never been to Italy, while I visited northern Italy (Baveno, Como) earlier this year and loved it. We would like to see the Vatican City, Colosseum, Pantheon, etc. like most other tourists hahah.

What places should we get tickets, guided tours or skip-the-line for? And what are the official sites to purchase through? I have found plenty and all seem quite legit. 
We also looked into some guided trips to Pompeii, Amalfi Coast, Toscana etc. but the long bus trips on a hot July day isn’t super-appealing. 

Feel free to drop any other recommendations or tips as well - as we want to experience as much as possible :)

For context we are Scandinavians, interested in history and respectful of their culture and traditions - not loud and obnoxious (I hope lol).

5 days in Jordan,"I just took my first ever trip to the Middle East, visiting Jordan in April. I'm embarrassed to say it took me this long (decades of travel!) to make it to this corner of the world. I think I got really caught up in the narrative around safety, especially as a woman travelling quite a lot on my own (thanks mum & dad for that fear!). Anyway, I'm so glad I did it because this was truly one of the best trips I've taken. My iPhone photos don't do it justice. 

In only 5 days I fit in sooo many different experiences. I climbed 2000-year-old ruins that rivaled Rome, slept under the stars in what had to be the world's comfiest bed in the middle of the dessert, floated in the Dead Sea, relaxed at an incredible beach club, soaked in hot springs, ate literally the best falafel of my life, and tasted locally-made wine in the winemaker’s own home. It was truly so much more and better than I could have expected, and everyone I met was so kind!

Barcelona was underwhelming,"Visited Barcelona recently for a few days as part of a larger Spain trip. I had very high hopes because of how much praise and hype Barcelona always gets. 

Honestly though…I was a little disappointed and in fact, I would probably place it as my least favourite place out of everywhere I visited in Spain (Madrid, Granada, Sevilla and San Sebastián). 

Some of the architecture is cool but I felt like there’s nothing that it offers that other major European cities don’t do better. It was smelly and kinda dirty, and I felt some weird hostile vibes as a tourist as well. The food was just decent, and none of the attractions really blew me away, other than Sagrada Familia. The public transit and walkability is *fine* but again, nothing amazing.

The negatives of Paris are overblown - I'll never get passionately hating Paris, its Okay and great if you love art & fashion. I think people that go with a perfect view of the city in mind will always be let down (its not even that dirty).

Having said all that, my family and I (husband, and 3 kids -9,10,17), may not get a lot more time to travel all the places we wanted to see before I'm gone.

I have never been to Europe, and I've always dreamed of visiting London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome (or Venice or Tuscany), and eating my way through the continent!

I am wondering if there is a way to visit all those places with 5 people in 2-3 weeks.

Train?  River Cruise?  What's the best way to get around?  Is there a way to get help planning this kind of trip?  Places to eat? Basically everything?

We are looking at a budget of $35,000 ($6k per person).

Edit:  to answer a few questions

- I am from the US (Denver, CO).

- The soonest we'd want to go is probably the fall.  My kids get a week off in October.  But if we should try and do next summer, that would give us even more time to plan.

Edit 2:  you guys are so amazing!  You've given me the confidence to know we CAN make this trip, even if the thought of planning it is quite overwhelming!

I'm the kind of person who usually does all inclusive because I don't like to have to figure out every detail!  

I'll likely take the suggestion of many of you to reach out to a travel agent and see what they suggest.  Seems to be the smart move!

Edit:  I got more messages and comments overnight than I have ever gotten before!  Thank you all.  It will take me a while to sift through.  But this is why I love Reddit!  When someone needs help, you all show up!

Edit:  a lot of you have been saying to take the trip sooner.  Unfortunately, I'm currently getting chemo every 3 weeks until the end of April, which means I feel pretty crappy 2 weeks out of the month.

So I can't plan the trip until I know how I'm going to feel when my chemo is done.

I really want to hold out until October so it won't be so hot, and I'll know where I'm at as far as how I'm feeling.

I know it's a risk that I won't be well enough.  If things get to that point, I'll probably cash in my 401k and just go!",1232,247,1739747507.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ir5gno/how_do_i_take_this_bucket_list_trip/,smartypants333

Going on the trip with the hubby and the in-laws, since my mother in-law has moderate stage Alzheimers, never been to Europe, so I'm planning to her a ""This Is It Tour"" <3

My Father in law favorite way to travel is a good road trip.

Form what I read Orvieto is a good place for our last night before Rome, Also read something about Montalcino.

Definitely going for that Italian Tuscan Charm, some wineries would be a lot of fun.

And would ideally prefer to stay out of big cities since we have the car and waiting to go for that rural charm. Thinking of probably head to Cinque Terre just to see the sea and one of the towns. Would that be a good idea?

I really need help to make this a memorable one.

Doing well regarding budget, I hope. Around 2k a day for food and lodging for the 4 of us

"Etihad's ""Free Stopover"" turned into a stressful trap – extremely disappointed","I wanted to share a frustrating experience with Etihad that turned what should've been a cool Abu Dhabi stopover into a really disappointing situation.

I recently booked an international flight directly through Etihad’s official website. While booking, I selected the “Free Stopover in Abu Dhabi” option – the promotion that gives you up to 2 complimentary nights in a hotel. I also spoke with two customer service agents who confirmed I was eligible.

Now, after finalizing the booking and trying to reserve the hotel, they’re suddenly saying I have to pay for it. I’ve spoken with several agents since then, and each one gives me a different explanation – some say I’m eligible, some say I’m not, and no one can give me a clear answer. It’s been incredibly stressful, time-consuming, and frankly, misleading.

I feel like I’ve been tricked by a bait-and-switch promo. I even had to write to their data protection office under GDPR to request a full copy of the internal notes and call records, because of how contradictory the communication has been. (Still haven't got it btw)

This whole situation made me lose trust in Etihad, and I want to warn other travelers: if you see that stopover promo — triple check every detail before booking and make sure you get any confirmations in writing.

Has anyone else experienced this? Would love to hear your thoughts or advice.

How racist is Italy and Greece?,"I am on a trip in Europe. I am an Indian guy with brown skin. 

So far I have travelled to Austria, North Italy(Dolomites), and Switzerland in my current trip. I'm not sure if I should be labelling this as 'racism' but I feel like the staff of places I've stayed so far in Austria have treated me a bit differently. I noticed the receptionists smiled while talking with white people but were quite cold when talking with me. Initially I thought maybe it's just something to do with me (and not my skin colour), but I saw an Indian couple in the same hotel who were treated same as me in Innsbruck. 
I didn't have any issues in the Dolomites except for few other tourists staring at me (probably because i was the only brown man in most places and not because they are racist). 

I am now heading towards Rome and then Athens and a few Greek islands. 

I enjoy conversing with local people. It is part of the experience for me. 

It would be good to know what to expect in Rome and Greece so that I prepare myself mentally and also maybe keep the conversations short and to the point if people had negative experiences in the past.

"My Dad Is in the ICU at Ospedale Isola Tiberina in Rome, Italy - Help Us Navigate!","My mom (70F) and dad (75M), Philippine immigrants and citizens of the United States, specifically from the San Fernando Valley region in Southern California, retirees, went on vacation with my mom's nursing school friends to Italy around August 13th.  My mom and dad were supposed to return on Thursday, August 22nd, but that's not going to happen.

They enjoyed about 2 days there but a couple of days ago my dad was admitted to the ICU at the Ospedale Isola Tiberina.  Prior to this my dad had endured days of throwing up and restroom trips to the point of lethargy.  Turns out my dad has had acute kidney failure and has been on dialysis since then.  Part of the blame seems to be on the facts that 1)  my dad has high blood pressure and 2) he was taking his meds as he saw fit.

My mom was a complete mess when I first got the news on Monday August 19th at 7:30 in the morning just before my own workday and was consoled by her nursing friend.  However, my mom's nursing friend has to go home on Thursday, August 21st as she has her own husband to care for.

Last update was yesterday, Tuesday, August 20th:  my dad was a little bit responsive but did not open his eyes and still on dialysis.  She got a doctor whom she said was able to speak English a little more fluently and was able to elaborate on the progress.  For now the plan is to the monitor his progress over the next 4-5 days.

This kind of puts my mom in several predicaments which I think would break my brain if I had to think about everything.

It looks like my mom will have to navigate the city alone for a few days while my brother-in-law makes an emergency weekend trip to Rome to help support my mom.  She can speak some Spanish and I've heard that native Spanish speakers can understand some Italian and vice versa but she's not a fluent speaker.

I think the most immediate is finding them affordable lodging, travel, and food in the immediate vicinity of that hospital.  Any help or suggestions would be great.

If it stretches out longer, there's a good chance I might have to sub in for my brother-in-law and get an emergency passport.  I (stupidly) let it expire this year.

\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE 8/22/24 2:11 AM Pacific Time\*\*\*\*\*  
Thank you for all the responses, I've been reading trying to absorb everything.  2AM California time is pretty much the only time no one is bothering me so here's what's happening.

-My mom gets a 2-hour visit (3PM-5PM local time) wasn't able to provide much update as to my dad's condition other than they are slowly taking him off the dialysis to see how the rest of his body supports him.  Mom says that he seems conscious but has not opened his eyes yet.  He was sedated in her last visit.  The reason I was concerned about the language barrier is because when she got there, the doctor whom she was initially in contact with could only tell her ""no good"" which with the weight of everything absolutely crushed her the first day

-My mom's tentative plan is to stay in the hotel where she had been staying.  She's tech savvy in the way a ""boomer"" would be;  we've been Facebook messenger to communicate.  We can't communicate outside of this.  My mom has been complaining about not getting wifi at the hospital.   She's also running out of her own medications as she had only brought two weeks worth, though my brother in law will bring the rest to her.    
  
-Her nursing friend is going to leave today.  It seems that she IS getting by with help from a Filipino Taxi driver and at the hospital with any lingering Filipinos that happen to be there.  She will likely stick to that routine for the next few days till my brother-in-law arrives.  I did encourage her to look for the ""Ufficina di Stranieri"" per a reddit suggestion here and she herself said she will be looking for that office in that hospital.

-My sister contacted the traveler's insurance phone number, but no response via email and via phone.  My mom tried calling but she cannot call outside of Italy and tried calling collect.  What are the questions we need to ask?

"Mexico City, Rome, or Dubai? 3 month trip over January to March","Hi all, trying to figure out which of these destinations would be best for a 3 month trip next year.

My current ranking is:

1. Rome
2. Dubai
3. Mexico City

But I'm very open to hearing from anyone who can provide advice.

My considerations

* No budget concerns, price is not a factor
* Rome would be winter, so the weather might not be good? Unsure about this. Plus side is that it will be way less busy and its football season and I love football
* How friendly and open are people in these cities? I've heard Mexico City is great for meeting new people, idk if the same can be said of Rome and Dubai?

Visiting Rome during the papal conclave.,"At least I think that's what it's called. I'm not Catholic in the least. My bestie and I have been planning this trip for months and just as luck would have it, the Pope dies and the day we get there is the same day the cardinals start deciding who's going to be next. 

I'm worried all the stuff we wanted to do is going to be way too crowded to be any fun. I was hoping to visit the Vatican while we were there but there's hella no way I'm going to try and navigate that shit show now. 

Does anyone have any experience being in Rome during a conclave? Is it just the Vatican that's super busy or is other stuff going to be swamped too? I'm thinking stuff like the colosseum, museums, and fountains.

In reality, there’s lines upon lines everywhere.

You have to go up and down elevators to get everywhere, with lines at all of them.

I’ll stick to Dublin for transatlantic flights from now on.

I know Rome is one of those cities that you can ""literally spend a lifetime and not see everything"", but we all know how that goes.

"Correct Order for Rome, Florence, and Naples - June 2026 Travel Dates","Planning a first-time trip to Italy the first two weeks of June 2026 (6/1-6/12). Party of 5, with 3 teens. It is more of an ""educational"" trip than a relaxation and wine trip. The trip dates and number of overnights are flexible, so we have 11-12 overnights to play around with (not counting the red-eye overnight flight at the start of the trip). That leaves us 12-13 days (not counting departure day for the red-eye flight), with the first day being a shortened/jet-lag day and the last day being a lost travel day. We are looking to stay in Rome, Florence, and one of Naples/Sorrento/Amalfi. We don't want to move between lodgings more than twice during the trip. We have flexibility on the flights/airports, so to avoid wasting too much time doubling back, we are likely flying into Florence and then heading south, or into Naples and then heading north (I know there will still be a small bit of doubling back if we stay in S or A). Three questions:

1. Which order is better: Florence-Rome-N/S/A, or N/S/A-Rome-Florence?
2. Which of N/S/A is the best fit to stay in for this ""educational"" trip?

Is 1h25 / 1h05 enough for self-transfer at FCO Rome,"Hi all,

I'm considering booking a round trip from Belgrade (BEG) to Palermo (PMO) via Rome Fiumicino (FCO) through Kiwi.com. The flights involve self-transfer (Wizz Air + Ryanair on the way there, and Ryanair + Wizz Air on the way back).

Outbound (5 Sep 2025):

*  BEG → FCO (Wizz Air) arrives at 18:00
*  FCO → PMO (Ryanair) departs at 19:25     
*  Time to transfer: 1h25

Return (12 Sep 2025):

* PMO → FCO (Ryanair) arrives at 17:25
* FCO → BEG (Wizz Air) departs at 18:30
* Time to transfer: 1h05

[Kiwi.com](http://Kiwi.com) claims this is enough time and includes their ""transfer protection"", but since it's a self-transfer and these are two different low-cost airlines (likely different terminals too), I'm nervous about the short connection windows.

Has anyone done a self-transfer at FCO recently, especially between Wizz and Ryanair? Is it realistic to make these connections if the first flight is even slightly delayed?

- great food across a variety of budgets (pastries/desserts too) <—- this is probably the thing that turns me off from prague the most? ive heard the food isnt great

Overnight in Rome or Dublin with an afternoon flight,"I'm looking at some options for a company trip to Split, Croatia from PHL in September. The options I'm seeing on the return all (well, most) leave SPU too late in the day to connect through any of the westbound transatlantic hubs like LHR, FCO, or DUB on the same day, so they all have some level of overnight layover. I've been to London a bunch and would like to go somewhere I've not been.

The two options I'm looking at, one gets into Rome at 2200 on a Friday, and I'd fly out at 1310 Saturday. The other gets into Dublin at 1635 Saturday and I'd fly out 0930 Sunday.

So the Rome flight gets in late but also gives me time the next morning; the Dublin flight gets in earlier but is a pretty early flight out, and I'm kinda leaning away from that for that reason. Never having been to Rome, and only spending one day in Dublin decades ago, I'm not sure which airport is easier to get to/from the city center, nor what the cities are like either on a Saturday morning (Rome) or a Saturday night (Dublin). Can anyone provide some input about transit experiences in those cities?

If it helps in terms of policies, the airline would either be American or BA.

Madrid or Rome at New Year? Which will be best for trips/sightseeing?,"Going away 28 Dec to 4 Jan and have narrowed it down to a cultural/sightseeing trip to Madrid or Rome.

I've been to both before, but have plenty I want to see in both place. Madrid I have been to for a weekend and went to the Prado and the Royal Palace. Rome I have visited twice but with groups of friends (and this was 8-9 years ago now), so while I went to the Colosseum and the Vatican I haven't really been anywhere else.

So.....I'm weighing up which one to go for. Rome clearly will have more options in terms of museums/galleries, although I do want to visit the Reina Sofia in Madrid. However what appeals about the latter is that I can plan a couple of day trips, most likely Segovia and Toledo.

What could be the deciding factor is how much is going on 1st January. While I know everything starts closing in both places on the afternoon of 31 Dec, it seems a fair number of events happen around Rome on NYD. Has anyone been then? Also Madrid seems to be a bit of a ghost town on that day.

We have a trip coming up where we will be flying to several countries in Europe.

I have driven in other countries and am not(said a fool:)) too concerned about crazy driving habits in other countries.  The car would be picked up and returned in Rome.  If it matters, we are coming from the USA.

* Is it possible to rent a car for something like this?
* Any recommendations for car rental companies?
* Is this not recommended given the current Ukraine, or other regional, situations?

Any, and all, help or tips provided will be greatly appreciated.

thanks!

I have received quite a few replies in a very short period.  To every single one of you, THANK YOU.  Our goal is to get to Istanbul, however, we are OK with changing our plans if we end up spending more time in other places and just don't make it all the way.  I have driven in Mexico and PR, so I know about other drivers getting very creative about how many cars they can fit in 3 lane road:(  We are also open to not driving once/if we get to Istanbul and just take public transportation.  The 20+ hours of driving is not an issue, so far my record is driving from the USA to way past Mexico City - through Mexico City - several times, almost 40 hours, not in a single shot.  We want to see, and experience, the local cultures and scenery, so we rather not drive at night or fly.  We are both extremely easy going about foods and accommodations.

Itinerary Check: Rome/Minori/Sicily,"Itinerary Check: Rome/Amalfi Coast/Sicily

First time travelers to Italy.  Looking for suggestions, feedback, etc. 

Dates: Mid-September; 13 Sleeps (Dates Below)

US: Wife (60f, active), Me (44f, active). Love red wine, incredible food, independent exploration, local-preferred experiences over tourist-focused experiences. Moderate budget.

Tuesday 8am arrival in Rome from Indianapolis. (Flights booked)

16/17 Tuesday + Wednesday = AirBnB in Trastevere near Ponte Sisto. (Booked) Recommended tours? What to buy tickets for/what to skip? 

Thursday = (Rome to Amalfi Coast) Train to Naples? Private driver Naples to Pompei to Amalfi Coast? (Nothing booked)

18/19/20 Thursday/Friday/Saturday/ = Thoughts on Minori? What I’m finding appealing is size, beach, path of lemons/access to Maiori, hike to/from Ravello, water taxi access, etc. Hotel vs AirBnB? (Nothing booked)

Sunday = Morning flight Naples to Palermo. (Booked) Transportation from Amalfi Coast to Naples (Not Booked)

21-28 Sunday to Sunday = Sicily - Yoga Retreat/Included Excursions (Booked) 

Sunday = Palermo to Rome midday flight (Booked) Would taking a bullet train to Florence for a few hours/dinner be insane?

29 Sunday night in Rome before morning flight to USA. Where to stay? What to do?


Thanks in advance! The yoga retreat with our local studio is getting us to Italy, but my wife’s grandfather was born in Northern Italy. We are hoping this is the first trip of many.

Experiences of racism/uncomfortable interactions with strangers as an East Asian (-American) tourist in Italy,"

Just went to Italy for the second time, and surprisingly this time I actually had a lot of uncomfortable/rude encounters that I feel like I can attribute to racism. I am sharing this just so other POC can prepare themselves on just what might be expected, as these details aren’t shared in travel guides usually.

When I went to Rome, there was this guy eating with his family who kept staring nonstop at us during dinner. Like, as soon as we were directed to the table, he started staring at us with an unwelcoming and exasperated expression. It proceeded almost unwaveringly, and I had enough when he started looking at one of my party member’s phone screen and then rolling his eyes. So I asked him if he had an issue, and he proceeded to act clueless. I told him to stop staring, that he knew what he was doing, and to set a better example for his young son. He wanted to argue saying that he wasn’t doing anything but his mom and wife (?) stopped him, and I told him if he had any issue he could talk to the waiter about it, and I would talk to the waiter if he kept staring. I could tell that his family was very uncomfortable with the whole situation and they ate in silence after that.

Before we left he apologized and tried to act really nice and told us he wasn’t a racist lmao (which ironically, through this disclosure, revealed that the issue at hand was indeed my race)

I was honestly kind of fed up because i was at the Milano Centrale train station earlier that day and some girl cut me in line for food, and I confronted her about it. She seemed a little surprised that I spoke English or something, and she gave two separate excuses. When I didn’t give into her bs she was like ""you know I tried to be polite"" and stormed off.

And while aboard the train to Rome, I was walking to my seat, and there were so many older Italian people who just kept staring at me. The train that I was on had seating in a table configuration, so you had to face the next row of people on board across a table. Funnily enough, I sat next to a (white) American couple visiting and across the aisle there were 2 older Italian ladies who seemed to be staring at me. I stared back and they would look away but I found them staring at me more. I don’t think they stared at all at the other American couple, who frankly were speaking pretty loudly in English

My assessment is that they are used to treating asians from their home countries poorly because they can usually get away with it. In my case, as an East Asian American, I feel like they think they can pull this type of stuff because east asians from asia generally aren't privy to what racism/microaggressions look like, and even if they are, they usually dont feel comfortable enough expressing themselves to do anything about it.

At the train station in Milan, we were stopped by a group of military/police officers who asked to see my passport for verification. I questioned it and asked if I could see ID or a badge because I was wary that it was a scam (have heard of something similar before), and one of the officers said show it to me right now or else you’re going to get in trouble and he put his hand on his baton or gun. Once they saw my US passport they started apologizing and asked me if I needed any help with directions. 

Either way, I still had a great time in Italy all in all - but I think these types of trip reports should be shared as well. It was also

I thought Barcelona was overrated. Until I went.,"I was in France visiting family when I found out I has a bonus week off for time in lieu so I decided to take a long weekend somewhere. My criteria was not too far from where I was, accessible by public transport, and easy to get home from. Barcelona fit the bill, tickets were fairly cheap so I went. 

I'd heard people raving about how beautiful the architecture and the history is but to be honest, I don't care much about architecture and history. Most of my trips are to remote, isolated places with beautiful natural scenery. I just wanted a place to lay on the beach and relax. I've been to Paris and absolutely hated it. It was cramped, smelly and full of tourists (yes, I recognise the irony) 

It's a amazing city. Most places are easy walking distance from the city centre. The beach is really clean and well maintained. The government has staff to pick up litter from the beach and the sea, and the facilities are surprisingly decent (for public toilets). 

I went to check out some of the tourist sites when it was too hot to lay on the beach and I was impressed at how many of them are in such close proximity, and are free to view or a small donation. 

Overall, things were pretty easy and there was a laid back atmosphere. It's clearly a tourist destination but it didn't feel like a rip off tourist trap like some places 

If you were on the fence about Barcelona, give it a shot. I'd stay longer if I could",2008,441,1690208089.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/158bwqm/i_thought_barcelona_was_overrated_until_i_went/,tomgrouch
14-day train trip from Vienna to Rome – which route is better?,"Hi everyone! I’m planning a 14-day train trip in late September, traveling from **Vienna to Rome**.

In May, went to Salzburg (4/13) for a day trip. I currently live in Munich so it's a short train ride from there, about 2hrs. In June, I spent two weeks in Italy: flew from Munich to Naples (stayed 3 days), then Rome (4 days), Florence (5/13; 3 days), and Venice (2 days).

Throughout the Summer, went to the Greek island of Zakynthos (6/13) for about 4 days and also visited some places across Germany (7/13; Schloss Neuschwanstein in the image). In September, spent a weekend in Liechtenstein (8/13) and, from there, went to St. Gallen, Switzerland (9/13).

In October flew from Munich to Barcelona (10/13) and, while there, took a train to Girona (4 days in total). After that, flew to the Azores - São Miguel (11/13) and Terceira Islands (5 days in total). 

To wrap up the year, flew from Munich to Luxembourg (12/13) earlier this month, spent over 1,5 days there, and then took a train to Belgium, where I visited Ghent (13/13), Bruges, Antwerp and Brussels for about a week.",3458,64,1735598236.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpzl9p,rubesf9

Some advice from an Italian living in Italy to those who want to travel to Italy to avoid scams,"If you go to Rome or the main Italian cities, pay close attention to these things:

- Never accept bracelets or necklaces from those who tell you that they are gifts, they are never gifts and will probably ask you for money back. Sometimes they throw you the bracelet so that you instinctively take it and then, as above, they try to convince you to take something out to send them away. The only advice in these cases is to completely ignore these people and not stop to talk to them at all, even at the risk of being considered rude.

- In Florence, some guys put fake paintings on the ground in the middle of the crowd, where one can easily step on them and then ask for money for compensation, they are not usually aggressive, but only slightly insistent.
Even in that case, it is better to completely ignore the people and go away pretending not to hear them.

- In Naples, as stated in the initial point, there are people dressed as Pulcinella or Neapolitan horn sellers, the former offer you a photo with them and then expect to be paid, a bit like those who are dressed as Gladiators at the Colosseum. For the latter, sellers of bracelets, horns, handkerchiefs or various knick-knacks, the approach is sometimes simply like ""Hey guys, can I ask you a favor?"" Never answer, ignore them and carry on, their goal is only to make you buy something and extort money.

- Finally, always be careful around tourist sites of those who offer to give you directions to take a photo or give you suggestions on how to do it, it is never free and always paid.

For taxis: always make sure the taximeter is on, never negotiate the price first and find out about the official rates on the websites of the municipal administrations of the cities where you are, so you can point out to taxi drivers, in the event that they propose a certain price, that theirs is too high. If you intend to pay by card, always point this out to the taxi driver first, since some use the excuse of having a broken POS to evade taxes.
Furthermore, official taxis throughout Italy are white, the others are abusive and illegal.

To eat, avoid restaurants or bars in the most central tourist streets, they are usually only crowded with tourists, especially those with waiters outside inviting you to come in, you eat badly and spend a lot.
Try to go to eat outside the tourist areas, where Italians usually go.
If you really have to go to a tourist area, even for a coffee, always ask for the menu first, at least you know how much you will spend.

To visit operas, parks, museums and monuments, always book on the official websites of the opera or museum and never buy fake tickets or tours there from those who want to extort money from you to offer you a tour at the last minute by skipping the line, they are ripping you off on the price by probably making you pay double. 

For now this is all that comes to mind, for any other questions or doubts I remain at your disposal  ",1189,114,1742666261.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jheekn/some_advice_from_an_italian_living_in_italy_to/,_Giulio_Cesare

Is a trip to Rome worth it for a non-history/arts buff?,"Heading on a trip to Europe in September, will be spending a week and a half in Paris (loved walking the city with mix of cafes/sights/architecture/vibe/shopping), going to Vienna for the first time (looks similarly stunning and cool to explore) and considering Rome.

"London, Paris, Venice, Rome!","hi guys! new to traveling and my first big trip i'm planning with one of my friends is for summer 2026. we're hoping visit London, Paris, Venice, and Rome. But our dilemma is that we only can afford about 10 days as it looks because we don't wanna be doing hostels and trains/plane fare is rather expensive as it looks for summers in Europe. Just wanted to come onto the subreddit to see if this would even be a possible trip with all of the places we genuinely want to explore. I'm willing to expand the trip up to two days to account for travel. If anyone has any advice regarding trains, planes, itinerary, or just the simple fact that our trip may not be possible, please leave it below! Thanks so much. 

Edit: Okay totally impossible haha. If I I decide to split 10 days into London & Paris, is there anywhere else in France that I could stay & still be able to travel to Paris from? I'm not really looking to stay IN Paris but rather a place a train ride away (personal preference, probably not logical but i don't care much haha). Also any other places in France close by that would be worth seeing if we have leftover time? Thanks for your advice guys!!!

Need help with 7 - Day Rome Itinerary!,"Mid 20s and parents going to Rome for the first time and need help filling in our 7 day itinerary. Any advice would be appreciated a lot! For reference we will be staying at the best western plus hotel universo and this will take place mid May. We’re trying to check the main boxes off in the early days, and then just soak everything in with little stress afterward. Keep in mind this is our first time out of the US so this is all pretty new to us:

———————————————————————

Day 1 (Friday): check in at 3. Visit the Santa Maria Maggiore (visit rooftop). Get food and settle in

Day 2 (Saturday): Vatican City (guided tour) in the morning and Castel Sant’Angelo. Maybe stay and explore around this area for the day? Would appreciate suggestions.

Day 3 (Sunday): Colosseum tour, Roman forums, Palatine hill, Trajan’s Market, Arch of Constantine. Where to explore from here?

Day 4 (Monday): Pantheon in the morning. Rest of this day is open for whatever

Day 5 (Tuesday): Galleria Borghese, then explore this area for the day? Unless there’s better options. 

Day 6 (Wednesday): Day trip (Pompeii/Ostia/etc?)

Day 7 (Thursday): completely open. 

———————————————————————

Some notable places we’ve noted as places we’d like to see but don’t know the most efficient way to fit in include: Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, Trastevere, Capitoline Hill, Piazza de Poppolo, Piazza Venezia, any of the catacombs.

Advice on literally anything, whether it be food, transportation, areas that are too touristy, common mistakes to avoid, anything at all would be greatly appreciated.

I just got back to the States from traveling around Europe for 6 weeks with my wife and 1.5yo son. Here is what I learned.,"
Edit: I actually had screwed up some formulas in my spreadsheet. The true cost of our trip was somewhere between 18-20k, as I'm too lazy to split all our credit card bills into travel/non-travel.

At first I was considering just posting a reel of pictures from my trip and collecting some modest comment karma, but instead I'd like to share my experience in a way that might benefit others who might be thinking of extended trips to Europe with a child of a similar age. Old enough to walk and enjoy things, young enough to be free on all modes of transport.

Our itinerary was Stockholm - Berlin - Munich - Riva, Italy - Genoa - Corsica - Rome.

1) The cost.

Our six weeks of travel cost about $18-20k My original early budget of $10,000 was completely delusional for the kind of trip we were looking to have. 12k of that was on accommodations and travel, and the rest on food, activities, and other things (travel insurance, car rental, etc..) You can definitely do it for less, but then you will be staying farther from city centers, cooking more at home, seeing fewer sights, and generally will be concerned more with budgeting. Personally, this approach was antithetical to the kind of trip we wanted to take. In our minds we were on a trip of a lifetime, and penny pinching seemed like it would just ruin our fun. I believe we made the right choice, though obviously we had to ensure that this was financially viable for us.

2) The work.

Roughly speaking, I took about 3 of those weeks off and worked for the other 3 weeks. Some were half days, some were a few hours off in the middle of a day, some were several days off at a time, all depending on circumstances. Being able to do this required a lot of prep communication with my colleagues on ensuring continuity and progress on our projects, but my job is extremely accommodating in this regard. My advice for those in remote jobs who are unsure if this is possible at their workplace is first closely research company policy, then find others who've worked remotely from Europe while employed at your company, and then bring it up with management. In my opinion, working in Europe on American (eastern, time zones more west might require a formal schedule adjustment on your part) time is perfect when traveling with a child. . They're up early, so you can go out and do stuff, go to playgrounds, museums, sights. Then your spouse can take over childcare for the first half of the workday (or you can take the first half of the day off) and for the second half of the workday the baby is sleeping and you can't go anywhere anyway, might as well work. At first I was concerned that work was going to be a huge bummer, but aside from a couple of days when I would have rather continued exploring Roman ruins or drinking beer in Munich, it was actually good to have a productive outlet rather than just have an extremely long vacation.

3) The childcare

If you are an average American family with a child, you likely get some occasional or regular help with your child or children from others, like your parents or a nanny, or daycare. When traveling, you will not have those people around (unless of course the grands or your nanny are going to travel with you). Having to take care of your child 24/7 without any help while on vacation is taxing and can feel like ""why the fuck am I doing this in the first place??"". I definitely had those thoughts. However, there are some important positives to this fact and ways to manage the weight.
The biggest benefit is the bonding experience. At home, my wife and I were both working, and trading off healthcare duties based on schedules and nanny availability. We were tired, unfocused, irritable. Often, we did not feel like our son was getting the best of us. On this vacation we were laser focused on him out of necessity. We were both present for all his little milestones and firsts, discoveries, foreign words he learned. His needs and presence were a blessing and opportunity to bond in a way that in my opinion would not have been possible in our particular situation.

3a) Outside childcare

This is apparently controversial, but mommy and daddy need a break sometimes. During this trip we employed the services of babysitters we found through reputable agencies, babysitters we found on Facebook (with a paper trail and references!!!), and of drop in day cares. The services available were dependent on location, and we had to get creative. Some hotels partner with babysitting agencies, some airbnbs have babysitting recommendations as an amenity, some cities have easy access to on-demand babysitting (Berlin) but drop-in daycare doesn't seem to exist as a concept (also Berlin). In Rome, we sent out emails to all kindergartens within reasonable distance of our Airbnb asking if we can drop our child off there. One said yes, and we used their services, but finding a babysitter seemed like a complicated process that we were ultimately not comfortable with. The going rate for a sitter from an agency in Stockholm is 60$ an hour. So we used facebook and found a fantastic sitter for 20$ an hour.
Do lots of research, send lots of emails, and ask lots of questions. As with anything related to parenting,  some people are going to judge you and claim that you're insane for ""letting strangers watch your child"". Well, a lot of strangers watched our child while on this trip and they all did a great job. Decide what you and your partner are comfortable with, set ground rules, and enjoy a much needed break while a (hopefully) qualified professional watches your child.",913,1000,1696187637.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16x9xki/i_just_got_back_to_the_states_from_traveling/,azzwhole

Rome - 2 nights

Train to Florance

Florence - 2 nights

Train to Berlin

Berlin - 2 nights

Flight to Copenhagen

Copenhagen - 3 nights

USA do’s & dont’s,"Hubby and I are going to the States in November. We’re both European and seasoned travellers but we haven’t been to the USA yet. The plan is to start a few days in NY, then fly to San Francisco and then rent a car and drive around California and Arizona (LA, San Diego, some hiking in Sedona, Antelope and Grand Canyon…) and end for a day in Vegas where we will fly back to NY to get our plane back home after Thanksgiving.
Are there any specific things that we should know? Maybe some hidden gems? A food that absolutely have to try?

Edit: ok, I got more answers than I expected and I can’t answer them all individually. 
So first of all: thank you very much for all the very useful and concrete tips!  Speaking of which: yes, I will be tipping! When in Rome, do as the Romans, no questions asked. 
And yes, I am aware of the distances and I have plotted the trip on google maps, and we are used to drive long distances. 
And we will be careful in the cities. 
Useful tips are for sure: the possible government shutdown on the 17th, the F1 races in Vegas, the roadblock at Big Sur and the importance of thanksgiving. These might impact our travel a bit.
Ow, and I won’t call my husband hubby anymore (I never do actually as English obviously isn’t my first language-or second- language).

In the meantime: a huge thanks to all of you for all the useful recommendations. Looking forward to it! I’ll keep coming back to read further tips!

Update after travel:

All in all, we had a wonderful trip!! I absolutely loved NYC and San Francisco!! We decided to skip the LA/San Diego part and went for the National Parks: started completely at random at Eastman Lake which was a very nice surprise, then up to Yosemite and Sequoia, Death Valley, Bryce Canyon (our favourite spot), Zion and Grand Canyon. We then headed to Sedona which was a bit of a letdown (just not our vibe), and then to the Valley of Fire before returning our van in Las Vegas.

In general I can say that we always felt safe and we never encountered any nuisance or crime. Hotels and food were fine, the travel in our van was epic (some freezing cold nights though)!
Any minor inconveniences: the price of eating out was higher than expected (about double I would say), we couldn’t find decent bread (except a good loaf in SF & the Belgian bakery in NYC) and I really couldn’t get used to the open restrooms. 
Knowing what I know now, I wouldn’t change a thing in our planning. I must say it is thanks to you all for all your tips. Almost every day I thought “according to Reddit, we now probably should go/do this” 😄

Rome Trip Report - Christmas 2024,"[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/llzDnvr)

We stayed in Rome from Dec 20-26. This was my 4th time in Italy but 1st time in Rome - it was fantastic and I can’t wait to come back! We also went to Venice afterwards, which was beautiful if not quite as magical as I remembered from 2016, but Rome has become one of my favorite cities ever visited so here’s an overly detailed trip report.

* Day 1 - Arrival and settling in, Santa Maria della Vittoria, Baths of Diocletian, Michelin star restaurant
* Day 2 - Porta Portese market, Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain, Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola 
* Day 3 - Pantheon, Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, Chiesa del Gesù, Colosseum, Basilica di San Clemente
* Day 4 - Vatican Museums, Borghese Gallery
* Day 5 - Christmas! St. Peter’s Basilica, Spanish Steps
* Day 6 - Doria Pamphilj Gallery, train to Venice

**On visiting during the holidays** \- I was a little concerned that most places would be closed for the holidays but turns out I needn’t have worried. Tons of restaurants in Rome were still open even on Christmas Day, most tourist sights were open on the 24th and 26th, and it actually felt really festive with all the crowds. I will say that while the city was nicely decorated, there weren’t great Christmas markets if that’s something you’re looking for. We hit up the one in Piazza Navona but it was tiny.

**On pickpockets** \- Thankfully we didn’t have any trouble here. I was prepared for the worst just to be safe and even got my dad an RFID-blocking card carrier he could wear around his neck under his shirt but it turned out to be total overkill lol. We’re from NYC which helped but our experience was true to ‘use the same awareness as you would in any big city’.

**On racism** \- We’re Asian American and I was dreading encountering this, but we didn't experience an inch of this, not even microaggressions. Everyone we met was open, friendly, and gracious.

**Day 1 - Arrival and settling in, Santa Maria della Vittoria, Baths of Diocletian, Michelin star restaurant**

Arrived early morning so our main goal this day was to stay awake. Our hotel was near the Spanish Steps which was perfect for visiting all the sights nearby - nearly everything was a max 15 min walk away. I’m a huge Bernini / Baroque art buff so I made a beeline to the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria to see the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa - incredible to see it in person! Lunch at Taverna del Seminario was fine, nothing to write home about. We wandered throughout the afternoon, took a much needed nap after all, then headed to the Baths of Diocletian in the evening. Unfortunately we missed the 6pm organs (not sure if it was due to construction) but the museum was chock full of sculptures like it was someone’s personal hoard and ended up being a sleeper hit. There were very few people and it was amazing seeing ancient Roman art so intimately (some even with the original paint)!

For dinner, we went to All’Oro, which has 1 star and came highly recommended. It was great, and it was absolutely both the most cream-heavy and ‘gimmicky’ meal I’ve ever had. The appetizer bonanza came on delightfully whimsical props like glass shoes and wooden ships, each course was well-executed and featured a LOT of cream and cheese, and the pre-desserts were another smorgasbord. One of them even came on a carousel music box. Some will think it’s gimmicky and annoying, others will think it’s fun and not taking itself too seriously. It was too much cream for me at the end but it was certainly a memorable experience going into this blind.

**Day 2 - Porta Portese market, Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain, Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola** 

Everyone was still super jet lagged so we decided to take another easy day. I thought Porta Portese would be more of a vintage/flea market but it was kind of like a garage sale mostly with used clothes, shampoos, electronics, etc; anyone looking for a true flea market will be disappointing. It was MASSIVE though, it’s over a mile long and made for a nice morning walk. I attempted to do Rick Steves’ Heart of Rome walk but my family kept getting distracted by shiny things (touristy gift shops) so I abandoned that plan. We eventually meandered over to Piazza Navona and admired the Bernini and Borromini, then checked out the Trevi Fountain which was sadly dry. 

Lunch was at Enoteca e Taverna Capranica, which was very cute aesthetically and perfectly fine gastronomically. Service was excellent! Dessert at Giolitti was ok, the gelato flavors were rather artificial and the texture was more icy, not creamy.

In the afternoon, we stopped at Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola, famous for the remarkable pseudo-dome by Pozzo for most people and its selfie mirror if you’re Gen Z. The line to take a photo with the selfie mirror was literally 30+ min long but…you can also…just look up! I didn’t believe the dome was actually fake for a good while because it’s just that realistic.

Cue another afternoon nap before heading out for dinner. We attempted Piccolo Buco but the line was nearly 2 hours long, insane. There was another pizza place around the corner called Pinsitaly that turned out to be amazing! NOT a tourist trap at all, as you might first suspect! Even better, they offered every pizza in half size as well so you could try more, which is my love language. The owner and his staff were so warm and welcoming too. We loved this restaurant. 

Ok more food…for dessert, we went to Mr 100 Tiramisu which, true to its name, offers a staggering 100 flavors of tiramisu with everything from classic to KitKat to Moscow mule to baklava flavors. We ordered 4 flavors - classic, strawberry balsamic, hazelnut, and chocolate biscotti. All pretty good though the coffee was too weak in all of them and the advertised flavor wasn’t strong enough. Overall, kind of underwhelming for us. 

**Day 3 - Pantheon, Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, Chiesa del Gesù, Colosseum, Basilica di San Clemente**

It was awesome seeing the Pantheon - all the pictures you see in books and online don’t do it justice. I was even more awestruck by Santa Maria Sopra Minerva - it wasn’t on the itinerary but we popped in on a whim, and holy shit am I glad we did because the vibrant star-studded blue ceilings were stunning. And I was even *more* taken aback when we also popped into Chiesa del Gesù, the grandest church I’d ever seen in my life. Why isn’t it recommended more?! I could’ve stayed there all morning! Can’t believe we just stopped into some random church and it turned out to be one of the most magnificent things I’d ever seen. Even just looking back at my photos I’m feeling the awe again. 

Quick lunch at Fuorinorma, which had excellent sandwiches. Even my super picky parents loved it. Then onto the main event of the day, a 3 hour guided tour of the Colosseum and the Forum. We booked our tour through Through Eternity and it was a solid tour, but mainly it was worth it for the access to the Colosseum arena floor! I got a bit emotional walking through the gate and onto the floor and imagining being in the shoes of the gladiators 2000 years ago. What an amazing experience. Another highlight was walking through Livia’s house in the Forum, which still had original frescoes on the walls. 

We capped off the day at San Clemente, known for being a church built on  a church built on a church. The current building was built in the 12th century, under that was a church from the 4th century that was converted from an ancient Roman’s house, and under *that* was a structure from the 1st century - and you can walk through all the layers! How cool is that?! We walked progressively more underground and it got darker and cooler like being in cave. It was surreal being inside an actual ancient Roman home fed by an underground spring.

Finally, dinner was at the popular and classy Ristorante Trattoria Antonio al Pantheon. Absolutely delicious pasta and the vibes were vibing. This one lived up to the hype.

**Day 4 - Vatican Museums, Borghese Gallery**

Big day! We booked an early morning tour of the Vatican museums starting at 730, also through Through Eternity tours, and it was SO worth it. The museums are huge and while I usually like to go at my own speed, a guide was infinitely more helpful here. Our guide Riccardo was actually a historian specializing in 4th century Christianity, which was literally perfect for this - he didn’t stop regaling us with tons of info the whole time. The map room was just incredible, and we saw the colorful Raphael rooms as well. The tour was also worth it just for getting in early - there was still a sizable crowd at 730am, but my god nothing like the ones at 10am. Forget shoulder-to-shoulder, I had people breathing down my neck.

Lunch at Panificio Bonci was meh, the whole group didn’t think the pizza was anything special, but in the afternoon, we headed to the Borghese Gallery which turned out to be everyone’s favorite spot the whole trip. Totally indescribably seeing so many Bernini masterpieces all together, in such a sumptuous palace. Way quieter and less crowded, too. 1000% recommend this museum if not already in your plans. 

We needed a break from the nonstop pasta so we got Chinese food for dinner lol, Ristorante Cinese Sichuan was decent. Great dumplings. 

**Day 5 - Christmas! St. Peter’s Basilica, lots of walking around, Spanish Steps**

Woke up at 6am for the second day in a row while on vacation, but I wanted to try and get to St Peter’s early to beat the crowds. I didn’t even know if it’d be open for Christmas Day, and apparently neither did the police because they told me ‘the Pope is still deciding whether or not to open today, stay tuned’ sooo I waited in the freezing cold for an hour (told my family I’d text them if it was open so they didn’t have to freeze with me). My atheist ass still can’t believe I did this lol. It sucked but I will say that seeing the sun rise and light up the facade of the Basilica all golden was simply breathtaking. 

The Pope did indeed open for business that day and the Basilica interior was beautiful as well. Chiesa del Gesù is still my favorite, but there’s no denying St. Peter’s is like…seeing the best of the best. Every inch of it is overwrought with gold and statuary, the altar is incomparable, the whole church is impressive in every way and really made me appreciate it objectively as a temple of worship. Made sense why everyone in centuries past was religious - imagine living your bleak, hard life but every week you get to walk into an immensely awe-inspiring, inconceivably beautiful church where you’re told everything will be safe and alright as long as you have faith. I’d be religious too! 

Lunch was at Dar Poeta, a pizza place. It didn’t look like much from the outside but omg the pizza was fantastic. There’s a pizza place called Razza in the NYC area that’s been voted best pizza in the city - I thought Dar Poeta was way better than that and I don’t think it’s even considered a top Roman pizza place or anything. Afterwards, we just leisurely walked for 2 hours through Trastevere and back home. Not much was open so being outdoors and cruising the neighborhoods was a great way to spend the afternoon. We ended up at the Spanish Steps for a nice view of the city.

Finally, dinner was possibly our favorite meal of the whole trip because it was just a wonderful experience all around. We went to Osteria Mastrociccia and ordered a bunch of pastas and seafood and apps - the food itself was terrific, but what really made it stand out was the service and ambience. The staff made us feel like we were walking into their own homes, they were friendly and jovial without feeling inauthentic, and every table that day was in high spirits and having such a great time. Maybe it was just because it was Christmas but I can’t describe the good cheer and neighborhoodliness of it all.

**Day 6 - Doria Pamphilj Gallery, train to Venice**

On our last morning, we visited the Doria Pamphilj Gallery - the inner gallery was really something and still managed to awe me despite everything I’d seen in the last several days. The audio guide was particularly helpful here.

And one last meal at Salumeria Roscioli. Sooo much has been said about this restaurant and it’s so popular that I booked 2 months in advance, but IT WAS SO GOOD. Definitely the best food all trip (though Mastrociccia was still my favorite experience). The carbonara was to die for. The oxtail stuffed zucchini flowers were perfect. Even their freaking bread was outrageously good. Fantastic way to wrap up our time in Rome.

That’s all for Rome! In the afternoon, we hopped on the train to Venice. This turned out to be way longer than expected so if you made it this far, you’re a fucking champ. Overall, I absolutely loved Rome - feels like a very livable city to me, and it’s heaven if you’re a history/art buff. ",2,6,1737403117.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i5ze5h/rome_trip_report_christmas_2024/,LieutenantKije

Rome + Florence in 8-9 days. Am I doing too much or too little?,"Part 2 of [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1abe7rj/rome_florence_in_early_march_is_8_days_too/) where I'm revisiting my itinerary based on feedback I got from it.

The goal is visiting Rome and Florence, the main attractions in each city (I assume I'll be back) in about 9 or 10 days. I'm focusing on history and art, enjoy the cuisine and have a budget of €1000 + travel. I'm in my mid-30s and I'm relatively fit. I plan to stay in Trastévere.

I'd like to know what you think about this revision of the places and activities I plan to do, especially the time they'll take. I'll try to buy skip-the-line tickets whenever possible but I know some places don't have such arrangements so I'll have to calculate ""time getting there"" + ""time waiting in line"" which may break my schedule.

Here's my new itinerary:

**Day 1**: First day in Rome. I'll arrive the day before late at night so I can start in the morning. Starting at 8:30hs

* Colosseum: 3hs
* Roman Forum: 2.5hs
* Palatine Hill: 1h
* Titus Triumph: 0.5hs
* *Total: 7hs of activities*

**Day 2**: Vatican City

* St. Peter's Square: 1h
* St. Peter's Basilica: 2hs
* Sistine Chapel: 1h
* Vatican Museums: 2hs
* Vatican Gardens: 1h
* Castelo Sant'Angelo: 2hs
* *Total: 9hs of activities.* This I think I'm stretching, but I think I can cut the Vatican Museums to 1h and strolling around St. Peter's Square may not take 1h.

**Day 3**: Other historical places

* Campidoglio: 0.5h
* San Pietro In Vincoli church: 1h
* Gesú Church: 1h
* Trajan Forum: 1h
* Fatherland Monument: 1.5hs
* Fontana di Trevi: 1h
* Spanish Steps: 1h
* *Total time: 7hs of activities*. I'll go to Fontana di Trevi and see if there's too many people, otherwise first hit the Spanish Steps and then go back to the fountain later at night.

**Day 4**: some sights and walking through Trastévere

* Curia of Pompey: 0.5h
* Pantheon: 1h
* Piazza Navona: 1h
* Walk from Piazza Navona, across the Tiber, stroll down Trastévere to Porta Portese all the way to Circus Maximus: 4hs
* Circus Maximus: 1h
* *Total: 7.5hs of activities*

**Day 5**: First day in Florence. I'll arrive the night before so I'll begin in the morning. This day I spend in the Duomo and around

* Duomo: 5hs
* Giotto Bell Tower: 1h
* Medici Chapel: 2h
* Mercato Centrale: 1h
* *Total time: 9hs of activities.* I may be stretching but I'm adding extra time to the Duomo. The Bell Tower may be mostly queueing and climbing the stairs

**Day 6**: Florence museums

* Gallery of the Academia dell'Arte: 1.5hs
* Uffizi: 6hs
* Ponte Vecchio: 0.5hs
* Santa Croce Basilica: 1h
* *Total: 9hs of activities.* Again, I'm giving the Uffizi lots of time, it may take less if I plan to see less and come back some other time.

**Day 7**: Palaces and gardens

* Piazza della Signoria: 1.5hs
* Palazzo Vecchio: 1.5hs
* Palazzo Pitti: 3.5hs
* Boboli Gardens: 2hs
* Piazzale Michelangelo: 1.5hs
* Church of Salvatore Al Monte: 1h
* *Total: 11hs of activities*. This I may have to cut in two

I have 1 or 2 more days (half of which is traveling back home, which may be from Florence airport to Fiumicino or traveling by train to Rome and then from Fiumicino back home). I could cut Day 7 in two, add Santa Croce and maybe Giotto and then I'd stay 4 days in Rome and 4 days in Florence, both running back and forth across the cities. I could also stay one more day and do a place around Florence or Rome, like Ostia Antica, Bologna or Siena.

Do you think this is still too much? Will I be too exhausted? What should I cut from my itinerary? What am I not taking into account?

Advice/Hacks needed: 4-month Rome > Singapore > Korea trip,"Hi all,

As part of my university's architecture program we spend 3 months in Rome (Trastevere area) starting in September and consists of lots of walking, sightseeing, urban sketching etc. right after this Rome trip, my friends and I are directly flying to Singapore for a week or two and then Korea before heading back to Canada for Christmas.

Due to the nature of this being a school term, I'll be packing my laptop, tablet, and meta quest 3 (this complicates things but is a must) along with the usual toiletries, clothes etc. **This is where I need your help and experience!** I'm a little overwhelmed and confused about how to pack for the Sept-Dec changes in temperature, (Rome Sept-Nov, Singapore and Korea in Dec) and such a long trip while minimizing on luggage. 

What I know for sure right now is to bring lots of sunscreen. Everything else is a bit vague, such as what are the best clothing choices I can make, especially for layering? Can I make do with a single pair of runners? What are some good money hacks (I currently plan to use my Wealthsimple card)? Most reliable airlines? My travel companions and I are all female, so if there are any specific hacks that apply, do let me know :)

Hoping to make the whole trip with my travel backpack (Forcaz Travel 500) and a larger carry-on luggage (I will need to buy one if anyone has recommendations for something durable and reasonably priced).

Any experience/hacks/advice you can share will be greatly appreciated! This would be my first time doing extensive travelling. Of course, I'll be googling all of this and doing my research, but it's always nice to hear from redditors instead of blogs trying to sell me an affiliate link.

Traveling is not the same experience for women as it for men and it's insane what women face around the world,"Anyone who thinks traveling (or just traveling and honestly just existing) for women isn't hard - I urge you to think about the millions of women who face harassment. I myself have been either sexually assaulted, harassed, groped, catcalled heavily or followed in: Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Waterloo, London, Lisbon, Rome, and Naples. I was recently assaulted in Naples and posted about it to let people (esp women) know what can happen and instead I received messages from tons of men telling me I'm ""playing a sad victim"" and that I'm crying about it (I was literally hugged, groped, and kissed today by a total stranger on the street while walking)

It's not easy being a woman and still enjoying things worry free like men can and it sucks we've created a culture and a world where this is prevalent. I'm not saying men don't have to be worried about solo travelling, but women have to be worried about everything men do AND assault on top of that. It's to the point where I can't even go out at night when I have paid to travel to cities, or go to famous landmarks, or bars/clubs, or even take public transport at night. 

On top of that, things like pepper spray and such are illegal in so many countries and harming the other person (as self defence) may even result in the woman being punished if the law deems so. But we need to understand that women cannot defend themselves like men can in situations such as being attacked. We are simply not that strong physically. I know for a fact that I and many other women cannot get a man off us if we tried to. So why are we expecting the same ""self defense"" efforts from men and women? Knowing that using a pepper spray will get me in trouble with the law but the man who raped me can walk away if proven innocent blows my mind. 

I'm tired of following endless precautions yet still being targeted for things like this and assaulted. People are always blaming women too like ""oh you must've dressed wrong"" or ""you must have smiled at him"" and if not blaming women, people will only be giving tips out on what women can do to make sure that they are not assaulted. But WHY are we pinning everything on women and making it their responsibility? Why can't we teach guys that this is not okay by having stringent laws and punishments and just realizing the human factor when it comes to making laws regarding ""self defense"" because unfortunately, women are physically weaker.

I'm tired of hearing that ""this is the culture with [ ] men"" or that my clothes made it seem like ""I wanted it"". Traveling and just this world seems unfair for women and men need to acknowledge their privilege and advocate for changes too. It isn't cool if your buddy assaults me and then you just laugh as if it wasn't a big deal. It isn't cool for you to say that I just shouldn't travel if it's like this. It isn't cool for you to assume that anything I did caused this. ",2854,97,1714610632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ci2ddg/traveling_is_not_the_same_experience_for_women_as/,xrshxa

I literally just landed in Rome Italy today in this is the process so far.,"Hey everybody I just arrived in Italy for tourism purposes. 


Flight:

I took a covid tested flight to get here. It went from San Diego to Atlanta to Rome. They require you to get 3 test. 1 PCR before you get to the airport. 2 at Atlanta before you flight(they give the rapid test takes about 30mins). 3rd right when you arrive in Rome.


From San Diego they required me to have a negative PCR test which was tricky cause it needed to be within 72hours. I got mine from Walgreens and I got by results in 1700 the second day from the test. You could search for PCR covid test rapid results and the one I found in SD makes you pay $300.


Once I arrived in Atlanta i went to my gate and the delta personnel had us fill out an online paperwork for the covid test there. Then we went to a separate room to get tested. This is the rapid test one. Once I got the negative result I went back to the gate and waited for my flight. Be sure to fill out the EU passenger locator on the delta website. They'll remind you of this in Atlanta and in Rome.



Once I arrived to Rome first thing you do is fill up another online paperwork for the next covid test. They ask for your passport and hold on to it until you get the negative result. 


After that.. I didn't get ask for visa or anything. After the test they just stamped my passport and they didn't ask for anything else. Went to the exit and got my bag.

How bad is Morocco in terms of scams/harassment from vendors compared to Rome and Athens?,"22M white American, looking for a trip to take in January after I graduate college.

Mulling over a few destinations now for this trip, and Morocco is one that I think would be really cool. Others I've had in mind are Spain and/or Portugal, or Peru (and possibly Bolivia). I have read all about the negative experiences people have had with Morocco here, and I'm curious as to people who've been to other big European destinations how bad it is compared to them. I did Athens and Rome last April, and I mostly just encountered bracelet scammers, beggars and the like; plus I knew to watch my pockets and bags on the metro. But it was tolerable, and they'd leave me be after telling them no. 

I'm just wondering, what's the difference in Morocco? I see people taking about vendors trying to rip them off or tour guides trying to take them to their ""cousins"" hotel or whatever, but I usually don't do tours nor do I really buy many souvenirs or spend much time in shops. I'd like to go, but if it's going to be a great deal worse than Rome/Athens I think I'd rather skip it. If it's about the same, I can handle that. I have no problem telling people no, I just hate being accosted 24/7.

No idea on exact itinerary but likely the usual Rabat, Fez, Marrakesh, and probably somewhere in the Sahara like Merzouga or something.",9,30,1711388023.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bnjkvi/how_bad_is_morocco_in_terms_of_scamsharassment/,NormanQuacks345

Three months in Mexico City: Rome or Coyoacán?,"Hi! I will be staying in Mexico City for three months while writing my thesis. This will be my first time there and I'm struggling to decide which area is best to stay in. I would like to be in a neighborhood that has greenery, that's safe to walk, is not too hipster-ish/isn't full of just expats, and has coffee shops to work from. I like to walk and run a lot, eat at local places and want to practice my Spanish. Which would you recommend between Roma and Coyoacán and why?

Final hours of my 16 months around the world trip,"**TLDR:** Made redundant at the end of 2022, didn't want to find another job. Packed up and travelled the world.

**update** done for now, flight soon, thanks for the questions. 

**update 2** ok really done now, boarding.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down. That coupled with the fact that we were cooped up after some of the most longest and strictest lockdowns it was time to get out and see the world.

The objective of the travels was essentially to explore and ""live"", as you will see most of the places we stayed were capital Cities. We ended up doing ALOT of day trips from the major capitals either by train or tour company. Most of the time it was much cheaper just to do a full day tour than to actually hire a car for the day.

Most of the places we stayed were booked through either [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Airbnb (booking.com was a much cheaper option most of the time)

"Heading to Lake Como, Florence, Milan, and Rome for my first int’l trip this year","Hi!! I’m from the US and making my first trip abroad this fall and I can’t put into words how excited I am! Over the last couple days I’ve really locked in on trying to get a loose plan together and at least figure out what hotels we’re gonna stay at, and since I’m a little compulsive with planning i’d also like to go ahead and get an idea of must see things, great food, good wine, etc. For my wife’s sake, i would also kill for a recommendation on a good cannoli. The whole trip might be ruined if we can’t find one haha! 

Any recommendation is welcome no matter how popular or how unknown it is! Also if anyone has feedback on any of the hotels that would also be much appreciated! Proximity to hotel isn’t really a huge deal when it comes to any recommendations you might have because I’m there to TRAVEL so i’m gonna travel. 

In Bellagio I’ve found a couple decent looking spots (Cava Turacciolo, Enoteca Angolo Divino). We’re also going to head over to Lenno and see Villa del Balbianello. For Milan, Florence, and Rome I have no clue where to even start outside of the big tourist attractions. 

Hotels:

Lake Como - Borgo Le Terrazze in Bellagio
Milan - Corner Duomo
Florence - Orto de’ Medici
Rome - Hotel Modigliani (not 100% locked in but will likely go with that

Getting to Italy Sept 26th and will be there until Oct 4th if that matters! ",1,2,1738089668.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ic8qo9/heading_to_lake_como_florence_milan_and_rome_for/,jdlowe10

Is there anything other than taxis, as I’ve heard that they will scam you. I’ve also heard that the buses are very unreliable. What’s a big family to do? Do they have public scooters you can pick-up and drop-off at designated locations? 😂",4,28,1711836951.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1brtzdy/transport_for_a_group_of_8_in_rome/,MilkTeaMoogle
Driving from Rome to Florence,"I am getting married in Italy in May 2025. We picked a villa about an hour outside of Florence. 
We are planning on flying to Rome since we can take a direct flight and not risk connections and delays with multiple flights. 
Since we are planning to fly into Rome our options for getting to villa are 
(1) rent a car and drive from Rome to villa (est. 3 hrs) 
(2) take train from Rome to Florence and then a taxi an hour to the villa 
(3) hire a private driver to pick us up at the Rome airport and drive us straight to the villa. 

We are leaning more towards renting a car since it would be convenient to have being in the countryside and being an hour from Florence. We are worried about driving the 3 hours if Italian drivers are crazy ? 
I know the trains are amazing but I am going to have my wedding dress and luggage and would rather have a car to take me directly to the villa. On the way back we will take the train etc. but I would like to be stress free on the way there. 

Any advice? ",0,12,1728854120.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g301h1/driving_from_rome_to_florence/,KaraKushi
Help me choose accomodation in Rome ,"Hi all! My sister is getting married to her fiancée, and they've asked me to organize their honeymoon. They want to do 6 days Rome + 5 days Florence.

For Rome, I wanted to find an accomodation in Monti or Trastevere, since they are two women in their 30s, not very well travelled, and they love art, so I wanted them to be safe and near to everything.

The thing is that it' +1000€ for the 6 nights and it's out of their budget. Which other neighborhoods would be safe and good for a lesbian couple but more on a budget? 

I also want to arrange a surprise for them like a dinner somewhere nice, or a private tour, special activity... So if you have any suggestions, I'm more than happy to ready them!

How to sandwich Rome in the middle of an Italy trip?,"My boyfriend and I have been invited to a wedding just outside of Rome in October. We are wanting to arrive a few days early and leave a few days after so we can have some time to explore. 

Most itineraries I have seen online either have Rome at the end or the beginning of the trip - what would be a good way to sandwich Rome in the middle? I am in a wedding the following weekend back in the states, so it doesn't really matter too much which airports we fly in/out of since we will likely just get one-way tickets (the USA wedding is in a different state than where we live). 

I have visited Rome and Florence before but it was when I was in high school, and my boyfriend has not see any of Italy yet. Ideally we would see some bigger sites and get to enjoy some leisurely days enjoying the culture - I know seeing Italy requires so much more time than a week long trip can provide!

"What are some well-intentioned, but bad, pieces of travel advice you often see given?","I think that this community is a useful tool for travel advice (if not the best or most well-refined) but one thing that bugs me a lot is that both here and other places, you often see people propagating travel tips as if they’re the end-all-be-all for every scenario. These people mean well, and aren’t telling you something like “Travel with a sign saying ‘Rob me,’”but the advice can still come up short. Oftentimes, I see people saying that when you’re visiting a city, you should spend at least a few days there in order to get the vibe. This is great until you realize that time and budgets are limited for a lot of people, and that their big trip might be once every five years, or ten years, or even their entire life! Despite this, you see people treating the idea that you're not *really* experiencing a place if you don’t spend at least three days there as gospel, especially on Reddit. The fact of the matter is, if you only have one shot to go to Europe, it’s probably a better bet to do two days in Florence and two in Rome rather than four in Rome- who knows if you’re ever going to see Florence again? 

Likewise, working the opposite direction, money-wise, are people who recommend upcoming or less-expensive destinations as a *replacement* for more popular/expensive places. This isn’t to say that recommending these places is a bad idea whatsoever, and indeed, some of them are favorites and better than the big ticket destinations, but the experience of having a coastal holiday in Montenegro is fundamentally not the same as the French Riviera. London might be profoundly expensive, but it’s also the only one there is, and saying “Just to to Georgia/Thailand/Spain” or whatever place people love to promote doesn’t change the fact if you want to see Big Ben or the British Museum, there’s only once place you can see them.
