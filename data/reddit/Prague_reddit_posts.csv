Is There Another City That Feels Like Prague?,"I traveled to Europe a long time ago, and I really enjoyed Prague. On the other hand,  I didn't personally connect with Paris. Sorry to Parisians.

Now I’m planning to travel to Europe again this summer, and I want to feel the same charm I felt in Prague—but not *in*Prague this time, because I didn’t have a great experience with the food there. Sorry again.

I’ve been searching online and looking at photos of cities like Vienna, Milan, Florence, Barcelona, Munich, Warsaw, etc. But none of them seem to have the same atmosphere as Prague.

I think there’s something special about Prague—maybe its architecture or the layout of the old town—but I can't describe exactly what it is.

If I can figure out what makes Prague feel so unique, maybe I can find another city with a similar charm.

So… what exactly makes Prague different? And are there any cities that feel similar to Prague?",626,428,1745559000.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k7dcg6/is_there_another_city_that_feels_like_prague/,Dazzling-Honeydew457

Armed robbery in Prague,"Well, I was out at midnight yesterday taking photos on the St. Charles Bridge. There were few ppl on the bridge, and while I was taking a long exposure photo and letting the camera do its thing, I look behind me and see this suspicious man staring at me. He then pretends to text. So I take my camera and start making my way back into the city. Another guy, probably 6'4, walks close past me and as he does he gives a slight nod but tries to play it off like some normal head movement. 

At this point I had the story in my head, and my intuition was telling me trouble was ahead, but I chose to ignore it. I've been out at night in every city I've been to and I'm always hyper aware about everything, but I convinced myself yesterday that I was just being paranoid. As I make my way back to the city, there were two roads I could take. One had ppl on it, the other was empty. I took the empty one because there was a photo I wanted to take. 

As I'm walking down this narrow road, I hear footsteps. Again I tell myself it's nothing. Then, I hear running. I turn around and as soon as I do, the man from the bridge hits me in my head with a weapon, some kind of metal rod. Immediately I'm disoriented and there's ringing in my ears. The man hits me in the same spot again, and that's when adrenaline kicks in. I turn and run, and as I do he gets me once more on the neck with the rod. I'm getting further away until I trip over my camera bag, which slid from my shoulders down to my ankles. 

Camera goes flying. The man takes my bag and camera, and I Immediately get up and chase him. But I couldn't run very long..blood started streaming down my face from the gash in my head and I became extremely dizzy and disoriented. I fall down near a taxi, and the amazing individual puts me in his car, my blood getting everywhere, and drives me to safety. As we're waiting for the police and ambulance, I feel very nauseas and I can barely breathe (felt like an asthma attack). The cops and ambulance show up, and I'm so grateful to them both. 

In the end, I had a concussion, needed stitches in my forehead which had swelled to a plum, had a knee, thumb, hip contusion, and a welt on my neck. Camera is gone of course, but I'm happy nothing serious came of it. If I hadn't turned around, the man would have hit me in the back of my head with full strength and things could have been a lot worse. Right now, the most painful injury is my knee..I cannot move it without fiery pain. I have a two week trip to Greece  coming up on Tuesday, but damn if my spirits aren't low after this incident.

Edit: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone wishing me a speedy recovery. Of course, I know I could have taken better precautions, and I shouldn't have ignored my gut, but it happened and now I can learn and move on.

Update: 

The man has been caught. 

My camera has been recovered. 

I don't know what details I can legally divulge about the case, but I've been in close communication with the police since the incident. And today, the day before I leave, they informed me they arrested him at his hotel. I went to the station and took back possession of my camera which I never expected to see again. Also, the man was not from Czechia, but a foreigner. But again, I don't know if I can legally say from where just yet. 

When I got the text, I cried for a minute. I was just so relieved that this man wasn't going to be on the streets hurting others, and that he was going to get sweet justice for what he did. He even had the weapon on him at the time of the arrest: a police riot baton from which a steel pipe extends. No wonder it hurt like hell. 

I'm just so thankful to the police and detectives for their work, and I feel a weight has been lifted from my chest.",741,145,1691689917.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15njbe5/armed_robbery_in_prague/,dark-masters-light

My Shocking Experience with Assault in Prague,"Hello Travel community,

I wanted to share my disappointing experience in Prague. Over the last three days, I visited the city and was really enjoying my time there. I thought it would be a great place for peaceful walks, and I even considered coming back for weekend strolls. However, on the third day, I experienced something that has left me feeling deeply upset.

That morning, I was physically assaulted by a man. He grabbed my scarf from behind and yelled at me. Despite the tram being full of people, no one reacted or helped. I suspect that this might have been a racially motivated attack, as I wear a headscarf. A friend who has lived here before told me that, although sad, such incidents are unfortunately common because of the high level of Islamophobia.

While I've faced verbal abuse on previous trips (only in Europe!), this physical attack was terrifying, and I am still shaken by it. I am now left with a sense of unease, and I am disappointed that this is how I will remember what otherwise seemed like a beautiful city.

"Which city should I choose? (Vienne, prague, Wroclaw or Zagreb)","(Typo: Vienne → Vienna)
It seems I can’t edit the title :(

I’m planning a trip from July 26 to early August (for about a week), and I’m trying to choose just one city to visit: Zagreb, Wroclaw, Vienna, or Prague.

I care most about city's appearand/atmosphere(like architextural vibe), weather(not too hot and humid), food, and how big and interesting the city is for traveling (including day trips around the city).

Zagreb and Wroclaw seem great in terms of city vibe and food, but I’m worried they might be too small or lack enough to do, and that getting around might not be easy.

Vienna is appealing because of its size and many people recommend it, but I’m concerned it might feel too strict or overly orderly, and the food might not be very exciting.

Prague has the best old-town in my opinion, but I’ve already been there. It felt a bit small, and I wasn’t impressed by the food. But since I love Alphonse Mucha, I’m wondering if I should go back there.

Which one should I choose?

After leaving Europe I'm finding it hard to enjoy the US,"I spent most of the summer railing around Europe and spent time in many cities I've never been. I feel I really got into the lifestyle there. Sitting outside to eat on summer nights. Walking and taking transit everywhere. Seeing people outside everywhere partaking in the city. Enjoying the historic charm that is in abundance, feeling safe everywhere at all hours(maybe with the exception of Marseilles and parts of London), etc. 

I feel like the US in comparison is just...underwhelming. I currently live in Nashville and most of my life have lived in Los Angeles. I want to move to a new city but really don't like any city in the US enough to be excited about going there. And it seems the only places in America that might give you a slice of that European lifestyle are prohibitively expensive, like San Francisco or NYC.

I feel like most Americans cities are sprawling, bland, built around cars, terrible transit, unsafe. A few years ago I was walking through downtown Atlanta on a weekend in the afternoon and was stunned that there were no people walking other than me. It was like the city had been abandoned. I could not imagine the center of a European city being completely empty of pedestrians. There is more vibrancy in a European city of 200,000 than in an American city of 2 million. 

After the architectural splendor of Prague and Edinburgh. the Mediterranean charm of old town Nice, eating in the medieval alleyways of Croatia, I come back to America and feel kind of depressed at the landscape of strip malls, drive-thru Starbucks, urban blight, sprawling suburbs with cookie cutter houses and no sidewalks or pedestrians in sight. Maybe one little historic ""old town"" street downtown that you have to drive into and that's full of souvenir shops and chain restaurants. 

I guess I'm just ranting and experiencing post-vacation blues, but I'm missing the European lifestyle so much it hurts and I'm having difficulty adjusting to America. I liked just about every European city I visited. There are very few American cities I'd bother visiting unless I had a specific reason to go there. 

On the plus side, the variety of natural scenery in the US, particularly the western US rivals anything in Europe and maybe surpasses it. And increasingly I'd rather rent a cabin in some place like the Smoky Mountains or Sierras in California than visit the cities.",6670,1875,1665514511.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/y1h4au/after_leaving_europe_im_finding_it_hard_to_enjoy/,ReflexPoint

Barcelona was underwhelming,"Visited Barcelona recently for a few days as part of a larger Spain trip. I had very high hopes because of how much praise and hype Barcelona always gets. 

Honestly though…I was a little disappointed and in fact, I would probably place it as my least favourite place out of everywhere I visited in Spain (Madrid, Granada, Sevilla and San Sebastián). 

Some of the architecture is cool but I felt like there’s nothing that it offers that other major European cities don’t do better. It was smelly and kinda dirty, and I felt some weird hostile vibes as a tourist as well. The food was just decent, and none of the attractions really blew me away, other than Sagrada Familia. The public transit and walkability is *fine* but again, nothing amazing. 

I usually like to judge a place based on its own merits but while in Barcelona I couldn’t help but compare it to other major European cities I’ve been and loved, like Rome, Paris, Lisbon, London, Prague, Istanbul (kinda counts I guess) etc. and finding it a bit lacking.",1157,765,1724721587.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f24vjj/barcelona_was_underwhelming/,Wooden_Mood_3359
"Which city is better to spend three days in rather than two, Budapest or Prague?","I’m planning an interrail trip across Central Europe this summer for a couple a weeks.

My plan at the moment is to start off in Switzerland, spending a couple of days in Bern. After that, I’d visit Vaduz in Liechtenstein for day, stay the night there and head to Vienna where I’d spend three days and nights. Then, the plan is to go to Budapest for either two or three days, Bratislava for one, Prague for another two or three and then finish in Krakow, where I’d spend two days before flying off the next day.

My question is which city would be best to spend that extra day in? My original plan before looking into things to do in each city was to spend two days in Budapest, Bratislava and Prague, but there seems to be much more to do in Budapest and Prague than in Bratislava and I think the additional day would be better spent in one of those two.

Which do people think is best for a three days trip? Both look lovely, with lots to do and see and I could definitely find things to do to fill the day in either, which I’m less confident about doing for a second day in Bratislava.

Need help with Zurich - Bavaria Germany - Austria - Prague - Budapest itinerary,"My wife and I are planning a 16 days trip. We are planning to cover following places but are confused about the order in which we should visit them. Also, does the list of places make sense?

1. Zurich (2 days) - This will be arrival and departure. Keeping one day in beginning and one day in end.

2. Bavaria Germany (4 days) - We will make Munich our base and take day trips to Fussen, Zugspitse, Nuremberg/Bamberg/Rothenberg

3. Austria (4 days) - We will make Salzburg our base and take day trips to Berchesgaden, Halstatt and Werfen.

4. Budapest (3 days)

5. Prague (2 days)

We will travel by trains. Which order makes more sense? Following are the options:

Option 1: Zurich -> Munich -> Prague -> Budapest -> Salzburg -> Zurich

Option 2: Zurich -> Munich -> Salzburg -> Prague -> Budapest -> Zurich

Option 3: Zurich -> Salzburg -> Prague -> Budapest -> Munich -> Zurich

Option 4: Zurich -> Salzburg -> Budapest -> Prague -> Munich -> Zurich

Itinerary Advice - Prague / Budapest,"Hi all! In July I am staying in Berlin for 3 nights (Friday noon - Monday am) and then planning to head to Budapest from Monday - Friday by train (need to be in London Friday evening). I was hoping to stop in Prague for at least an overnight on Monday and potentially head to Budapest on Tuesday afternoon, but this part of my trip is somewhat flexible. 

Can’t decide if:
1) I should split time between Prague and Budapest and do 2 nights in each (Prague Monday-Wednesday am; Budapest Wednesday - Friday) 
 
Or 

2) Only spend 24 hours in Prague (Monday - Tuesday afternoon) to allow for more time in Budapest (Tuesday evening - Friday afternoon) 

I am almost split down the middle on interest level of each, I enjoy cultural exploration during the day and love exploring nightlife in the cities I stay in, however I think Budapest might have a slight leg up since I’ve read there is more to do and it’s a further journey and hence maybe deserves more time. What are some initial thoughts and impressions? What would you pick? 

I do not get to travel to Europe often and would like to make the most of my top 2 cities I have never been.

Vienna vs Budapest vs Prague Christmas markets,"Trip report: I have just returned from several days in each of these cities, seeing their Christmas markets. My initial reactions are that Vienna has the least inspiring markets.  Lots of apparently identical booths, some selling goods that don't seem to be local, and heavy on just a few foods.

Budapest Christmas markets were much better. You could get far better food and there was a greater variety, including booths that seem to be one of a kind and local-ish. Salmon roasting over wood fires was especially good. People seemed to be having a lot of fun.

Prague's markets were also very good but smaller than Budapest. Still lots of good food and original/local goods.

Which should you visit? Budapest if you are young and also want to party. Prague, if you have a little more cash to spend and aren't so interested in clubs. I personally find Prague to be a more charming town, but was far more impressed by Budapest than I expected to be.  Will likely return to both.

"Going to Europe this summer, starting off in London and wondering if the cities I've chosen to visit: Prague, Brussels, and Berlin have a good mix of city vibes with countryside scenic spots that are easily accessible","Hello!! I'm planning a trip this summer and would love some advice. I'm heading to Edinburgh for the Oasis concert and taking two weeks to explore some European countries I haven't visited before. My current plan is to spend 2–3 days in London, then visit Prague, Brussels, and Berlin.

For context, I’ve been to Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, as well as a few other countries. I love exploring the countryside but also enjoy wandering through big, beautiful cities—getting lost in the crowd rather than spending too much time in museums.

I have a few questions:

1. Are these cities good to visit in the summer?
2. Do these countries have easily accessible countryside or scenic spots worth visiting?
3. How would you recommend splitting my time between these destinations?

- beautiful green spaces and gardens (especially for spring flowers)
- charming and pretty neighborhoods to explore and wander around that let you escape the touristy center
- great food across a variety of budgets (pastries/desserts too) <—- this is probably the thing that turns me off from prague the most? ive heard the food isnt great
- beautiful architecture 
- tourist sites not too overcrowded/chaotic (for reference I went to Rome in Dec and thought the crowds were perfectly okay but Japan during sakura season was a hectic mess)
- interesting museums and historical sites

Overnight  train to Budapest 

4 nights Budapest

We like great beer and good vibe bars. Also into food (who isn’t). We tend to venture out of the tourist areas pretty much everywhere we go but of course we want to see the popular stuff as well. 

Coming from US If that matters 

Would you change up the time in each at all or does our schedule a lot a decent amount of time to see experience a lot? We are considering adding a day somewhere if it’s worth it. 

Thank you in advance. 

Update:
Thank you for the responses and it seems clear we want the extra time in Budapest.

We arrive in Prague on a Thursday morning and taking an overnight train Sunday night. So it’s only 3 nights in Prague but close to 4 full days. Does anyone think we should leave Prague a day earlier to make it 2 nights but 3 days of being there? We could also potentially add a Budapest day at the end of our trip but still looking at that.

"Planning a trip to Prague, any thoughts on my itinerary?","I'm planning a solo trip to Prague along with my trip to Budapest in July.

I plan to stay at a party hostel to meet other people. I'm still deciding which hostel to stay at but I think I'm leaning towards Madhouse. If anyone here has stayed at a party hostel in Prague and could share their experience, that would be great!

This is my itinerary for Prague as of right now:

Monday July 14:

* Arrive in Prague from Budapest in the afternoon
* Participate in one of the daily events hosted by the hostel or just rest for the afternoon

Tuesday July 15:

* Charles Bridge
* Prague Castle
* St. Vitus Cathedral
* Prague Boats – Evening Sightseeing Cruise

Wednesday July 16:

* Dancing House
* National Museum
* The Powder Tower

Thursday July 17:

* Old Town Square
* Prague Astronomical Clock

Friday July 18:

* Depart from Prague back to Toronto (where I'm from) in the afternoon

Rome for the first time with my parents - blatant racism was disappointing,"My boyfriend and I invited my parents to visit Rome with us. They live in the USA and have never traveled to Europe before (I grew up poor because my parents were in phd and post-doc programs that took awhile and we never had the means to travel). They were both so excited because traveling to Europe was their dream. I now make enough money to spoil them (and I have to do it soon as they are getting older) and we all couldn’t sleep from excitement the weeks leading up to this trip.

When my mom saw the Trevi Fountain, she burst into tears because she never thought she’d make it to Rome in her life time. This was despite the crazy heat and throngs of tourists pushing against her. She was so happy to just be here. My dad also could not stop taking photos and looking around in awe. He is normally very stoic but he was so amazed by the sceneries that it cracked his normal quiet demeanor.

However, on our last couple of days we experienced some awful racism that ruined our trip. 

The first incident happened in Trastevere. We were going up a street that lead to an outlook. On that street, there was a man leaning against the railing facing in the sidewalk. There were many people in front of us also going up that sidewalk. However, when he saw my mom about to walk past him, he pulled out his mask and put it on while giving her major side eye and a general look of disgust. This confused my mom because there was a huge group that passed him minutes ago, but they were all white. My mom is Asian. He didn’t put on his mask for the non-Asian tourists passing him.

I saw this all happen and asked him why he did that in English as my mom was extremely upset. His wife, sitting across from him leapt up and started screaming at us to “go away” and calling us crazy bitches over and over again. My mom and I didn’t raise our voices at all so this behavior seemed really defensive and rude overall. She kept yelling at us and getting up in our faces that we walked away eventually. However, it truly made us feel crappy and unwelcome in this country / city. The subtle way this man looked at my mom and put on his mask, the gaslighting for calling US crazy were quiet forms of micro aggression and racism that hurt like hell. 

The second incident happened at a grocery store near the colosseum. My dad and I went to grab some vegetables. We didn’t realize that we were supposed to weigh our vegetables ourselves to get the price. During checkout, the cashier looked at the cucumber we bought and told us to “get a number.” We didn’t realize she meant weight so we gave her a produce number. She rolled her eyes and threw the cucumber aside and said under her breath “stupid Chinese.” She never put the cucumber back. She then asked us to pay and my dad inserted his card. She told him to sign. He was reaching to sign, but then she slapped his hand away and forged his signature herself while rolling her eyes and calling us stupid Chinese again. I asked what was with her attitude and she looked at me and said “I don’t understand your English.” Which is absurd because I was born in Wisconsin lol.

Other incidents like these happened too, but they were less blatant and egregious. We were so excited to be here but now we are just sad and feel unwelcome.

We are going to Florence next week but it’s hard to feel excited. Instead I have major anxiety about getting treated poorly because we are Asian. Is this normal behavior in Italy?",2197,811,1662834201.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xawa16/rome_for_the_first_time_with_my_parents_blatant/,mochi_donuts414

"Advice Needed for My First Solo Trip in Europe (Vienna, Budapest, Prague)","**Hello Everyone,**

I’m a 29-year-old Palestinian male, born and raised in Saudi Arabia. I’ll be traveling to Milan for a business trip from January 27th to 31st. After that, I have one week for vacation, and I’m planning my first-ever solo trip—a dream I’ve had since childhood to travel alone and explore places on my own.

Last summer, I visited Milan and Rome and explored all the major attractions, so this time I’m looking for something different. I’ve come up with a tentative plan but could use some advice or suggestions to make it better.

Here’s my plan:

* **January 31st**: Fly from Milan to Vienna and stay for one night.
* **February 1st**: Take a train from Vienna to Budapest and stay there for three nights (until February 4th).
* **February 4th**: Travel by train from Budapest to Prague, stopping in Bratislava for a day trip (no overnight stay). Spend two nights in Prague.
* **February 6th**: Return to Vienna for one night, as there’s a direct flight from Vienna to Riyadh the next day.

I’m a little nervous about the planning and would love suggestions. Does this itinerary sound good, or is there a better route or alternative destinations you’d recommend? Your advice would be greatly appreciated!

Portugal in February? Or Prague/Vienna?,"Hello. I'm organizing my traveling schedule for 2025 and I'm having this dichotomy. I need to take holidays before March and I'm between these two options.

I was organizing a trip to Portugal last year but it became too bloated: I wanted to see Lisbon and Porto but also Cascais, Sintra and visit the beaches in Setúbal and Algarve. I didn't begin planning the Prague/Vienna trip yet

I'm interested in visiting the old cities, castles and museums but also do some trekking in nature. I'd prefer not going somewhere too cold for this since I don't have winter equipment for trekking. I was wondering if Prague/Vienna is a good option for that anyway, perhaps some town, resort or something in Austria or Czech Republic would offer the same experience as Sintra.

I'm traveling from Dublin and my budget is in the ~€700 for a week or less

"Winter Jacket for December Trip to Budapest, Vienna, Bratislava, and Prague","Hi everyone!

I’ll be traveling in December (4th-14th) to Budapest, Vienna, Bratislava, and Prague, and I need help figuring out what clothing I’ll need to stay warm. Since I’m from a warmer country (winter temperatures here are usually around 6-8°C), I don’t own any winter jackets and want to make sure I’m prepared.

I’m considering buying a **3-in-1 jacket** like:

* The North Face Evolve II Triclimate DryVent
* Columbia Element Blocker III Interchange (blue)

But I’m worried that these might not be warm enough for the temperatures there. I don’t want to invest in a very heavy jacket, as I won’t use it much back home. Alternatively, I’ve thought about buying **separate layers**: a warmer midlayer for insulation and a waterproof/windproof outer layer to handle rain and wind.

My plan is to wear a thermal base layer and a long-sleeve shirt underneath the jacket.

**Questions:**

* Do you think a 3-in-1 jacket is a good option for these cities in December, or would I be better off with separate layers?
* Are the jackets I mentioned warm enough for this type of winter, or should I invest in something heavier?
* Any specific jacket recommendations?

Trying to decide between two itineraries for my Central Europe trip (landing into Prague; 20 day trip). Hoping someone can help me choose which to go for!,"Hey all,

I am trying to finalize my Central Europe itinerary and can't decide between these two itineraries. Which one would y'all suggest? I am arriving in Prague on May 2nd and flying out of Prague on May 22. I have only been to Scotland and Italy in Europe. I would say I prefer a faster pace of travel, I kinda get bored sticking around one place to long. For example, I had 3 full days in Florence, Italy, and it felt like way too much (however, I am not a huge museum person). My favourite place in Italy (and by a long shot) was Cinque Terre. I think I enjoy doing some more outdoorsy stuff with nice sceneries and cool cities. I know I don't have to many outdoorsy places, but for my first trip to the area ive realized I can't do everything. In Ljubljana I may rent a car and go to some of the national parks and stuff to get out more. I really want some nice pictures of the alps if possible! I skipped the Dolomites in Italy when I went and I super regret it. I really like itinerary 2 because I can go to Innsbruck, but it's kind of out of the way and adds on to my travel time quite a bit. I basically lose a day traveling between Vienna/Ljubljana/Budapest/Prague because the train rides are long. However, I wouldn't say itinerary 2 is to far off of how I've done my previous (while limited) trips. However, I haven't done like multiple 7 hour train rides between places. Usually between 3 to 5 hours.

Prague or Gdansk for a short break?,"Hi all, 

I'm planning to take my mum on a short city break (3-4 nights) for her birthday and am torn between choosing Prague or Gdansk in Poland. 

I get the impression there is more to do in Prague but it is more expensive and less convenient (would have to travel a further distance to the airport) whereas Gdansk is reachable by my local airport. 

My budget for either would ideally be £500 (not inc spending money). I've looked at hotels in both cities and have reserved one in Prague but am still considering Gdansk as a cheaper option. My main reason for choosing Prague is the buildings and sightseeing - my mum is really into architecture, especially in the art deco/ nouveau style. 

For context, im looking for somewhere historical with plenty to do (enough to fill out a few days anyway), nice vegetarian food and nice architecture. We wouldn't really be going drinking so nightlife isn't too important - we may go for some cocktails but nothing too heavy. 

If anyone has been to both/ either would love some advice! Or if there's somewhere else you'd recommend, please let me know! 

For context I've been to Krakow and Riga and am looking for a similar vibe to these two places. I really loved the Kazimierz district in Krakow so something similar would be ideal.

Question for travel to Prague & Budapest,"Hi all! My boyfriend and I are looking to do a Prague/Budapest trip in April/May. For reference, we would be flying out of Washington DC.

I don't get a huge about of PTO, so we would be looking to do 8-9 days total (3-4 days in each city).

A couple questions for those of you who have traveled in the area:

* Is there any big benefit to starting in one city or the other? We would be simply basing where we start/end based on flight prices.
* Would you recommend taking a train/bus or getting a rental car to drive from one city to the other? We have rented cars when traveling in the US and like the freedom of getting around, but we have never dealt with picking up a rental car in one city in Europe and dropping it off in another.
* If we had one extra day free would you spend it on Prague or Budapest? We have never been to either city.

How Would You Spend 5 Days Between Prague and Chur?,"Hi everyone,

We’re traveling from **Prague (departing 7 August)** to **Chur (arriving evening 11 August)** and have **5 days to fill**. We’re open to ideas and looking for the best way to spend this time!

* **Munich (2.5 days)**: Stay in the Old Town, visit beer halls, Concentration Camp and explore.
* **Munich > Innsbruck (1 day)**: Travel from Munich by train or car
* **Innsbruck > Füssen > Chur (1 day)**: Visit Neuschwanstein Castle before heading to Chur, but this involves a lot of driving in one day.

We’d prefer train travel, but are open to renting a car if it’s not overly expensive (alternate drop-off locations seem very exy).

Prague and Vienna July 2025,"Hello! I posted my original itinerary a month ago and have done some revising, as I was told it was too busy. I will be travelling with my husband and (almost) 5 year old to Prague and Vienna in July. We decided to simplify the trip with only two major destinations. I have a couple questions, however:

1. How many days in each city? Right now I'm thinking 4 in Prague, 5 in Vienna. We would be flying into Prague with an 11:30 arrival. We were planning on taking a train to Vienna, so I guess that would take a good chunk of time on the day we arrive. Is this a good division of times between the two cities?

2. Can I do this trip without a car seat or booster seat? Is it feasible to just use public transit with child and all the luggage in tow?

3. We didn't want to bring a stroller. Is this crazy of us?

"Considering going to either Munich or Berlin, Germany for a few days before I go to Prague/Vienna/Budapest. Which city do you recommend?

As far as budget, I'm not too picky about accommodations, as long as they are clean. Although I'm guessing one city might be cheaper than the other? That could be a factor for which I would choose. Another consideration is which city is more ""unique"" and will have things that I wouldn't already see in Prague, Vienna, or Budapest?

Copenhagen/Stockholm vs Berlin/Prague/Vienna in mid-September?," Hi all,

My BF and I (both mid-20s, from USA) want to go to Europe sometime in mid-September and need advice on what’s better suited for us based on our interests.

We were thinking a 10-14 days to either:

* Copenhagen > Malmo > Stockholm
* Berlin > Prague > Vienna

I’m doing research on both trips and am a bit conflicted on which is better suited for us.

We’re not big on night life (not big drinkers), so we're more of early risers. We love great food and would try fine dining, coffee shop, pastries, architecture, nature. We’re not big on museums, but I wouldn’t mind visiting 1 or 2 museums. We do however love walking around and visiting major landmarks while enjoying the city.

We are definitely more chill people and are okay with wandering around or staying an hour or two in a coffee shop relaxing. 

I’m leaning towards Copenhagen/Stockholm because it seems less busy and relaxing and we can maybe take more day trips, but Berlin/Prague/Vienna seem to have so much to offer that I feel like I would be missing so much (especially since Vienna and Prague seem to have much more interesting architecture, although Berlin is more so about the museums).

Does anyone have any thoughts about which trip they think would be better for us? Or just general facts that I'm overlooking? Also interested in your experiences if you've been to any of the cities I mentioned!

Prague - Budapest Itinerary,"Hi travelers,

We are family of 3 (Couple and 1 7yo boy) are going to travel to Central Europe this June.

Traveling from Prague as the entry point and Budapest the exit. We are not sure if there is the route is feasible or is there any good info/tips we can add on into our trip.  In short, we had 12.5 days.

1. Day 1-3 Prague (2.5 days)

\- Explore Old Town

\- Visit Prague Castle (+Lesser Town area)

\- Visit Lego Museum (is it good?)

\- Day Trip: Kutna Hora or Karlovy Vary

\- Optional: Hike Petrin Hill, Explore Jewish Quarter

2. Day 4-5 To Cesky Krumlov (2 days)

3. Day 6-9 To Vienna (4 days)

\- Visit Schonbrunn Palace

\- Explore Downtown (Opera House, Cathedrals etc)

\- Premium Outlets

\- Day Trip: Bratislava

4. Day 10-12 (13th being half day) To Budapest (3.5 days)

\- Visit Buda Hill (Fisherman Bastion etc)

\- Visit Children Railway

\- Explore Pest Region

\- Optional: Margaret Island

We visited Salzburg/Hallstatt and Germany before, so we would skip any side trip there.

Question to ask:

1. What are the payment method in those countries? Are credit card (Apple Pay) feasible?
2. Traveling by Train/Bus (train preferred). Is it too difficult to find route from Cesky Krumlov to Vienna?
3. Is Cesky Krumlov too many days to spend? is there any good side/day trip from Cesky Krumlov?
4. Maybe the trip are too sparse, that we feel there could be some other town/city to fit in a long the day as the base.

Hostel for 30 year old in Prague?,"Hey everyone, I'm planning on going to Prague for a week and currently looking for a place to stay.

I've already looked up for other threads on this matter on this sub and others, but those mostly revolve around people feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable about being 30 and in a hostel, which isn't my issue.

"One Month Vacay with 5 yr old in Feb, Prague or Madrid?","I planned to do IVF abroad and narrowed it down to a clinic in Prague and a clinic in Madrid. Having compared everything else and the clinics both seemed to be great, the deciding factor would be which city is better for living with a kid for a whole month. I will have my 5 yr old with me, so I would like a safe and walkable city that has a lot of kid's activities. I know the 2 cities are probably close in comparison, but if you have to pick, which one would you pick? Please also recommend a neighborhood to stay at that is more family friendly in the city that you prefer.

Location to visit between Prague and Budapest for a day,"I will be travelling with my wife (both late 30s) to Prague, Budapest and Vienna in late December and early January. Instead of 7 hour train journey between Prague to Budapest, we prefer to stay for a night somewhere in between the two cities.  

One option we are considering is Bratislava. Can you suggest any other options to consider? 

We are also open to consider a nice small town.
We are not party people, so it would be enjoying nature, sights, walking, architecture,, museum etc. (of course not all necessary). 
It must be accessible by train.

Choosing Between Munich and Prague for a 3-Day Trip,"Hello. I would like an opinion on choosing between Munich or Prague for a 3-day trip. I will be visiting Budapest and Vienna, and then I would go to Munich before heading to Milan where I catch my flight home. However, seeing the hotel prices in Munich made me a bit apprehensive, as the only reason I would go to Munich is because it is closer to Milan where I catch my flight. However, if I go by train from Vienna to Prague, I can take a plane from Prague to Milan.

In your opinion, for someone who has not been to either of these two cities, which would be more attractive for a tourist? I believe Prague might be, but would it be too similar to Budapest or Vienna? As for Munich, is it really a tourist destination?",7,24,1719588825.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dqmhh6/choosing_between_munich_and_prague_for_a_3day_trip/,maurimbr
Prague > Vienna/Bratislava > Budapest trip,"Looking at a one week trip from the UK to do a central Europe city tour in (possibly) July. Never been to any of these cities, and just looking for some advice on the scheduling really.

I love walking around cities, visiting sights/museums. I also am fully aware that I won't see everything there is to see in this timeframe, but I'd thought of the following schedule based on some flights I've seen:

Friday evening: fly Heathrow > Prague

Sat/Sun/Mon: Prague

Tue AM: Prague > Vienna

Tue PM/Weds/Thu: Vienna + Bratislava half-day trip

Thu evening: Vienna > Budapest

Fri/Sat/Sun AM: Budapest

Sun PM: Budapest > Heathrow

Any advice on the balance of the schedule would be welcome. From researching Prague and Budapest seem slightly more appealing to me than Vienna so I've leant slightly towards them in terms of time spent there, but happy to hear other opinions. To be honest, Bratislava is more of a ""tick off a city"" trip, hence half-day max.",2,8,1734450294.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hgdfj0/prague_viennabratislava_budapest_trip/,ThaddeusGriffin_
Zurich to Prague sleeper train fully booked. Keep checking or give up?,"I've been piecing together ideas for a European trip in March. I decided on visiting Barcelona and Prague, and part of the adventure would be to take a sleeper train in between. I picked the train routes suggested by Google maps, and I checked the SNCF and SBB websites yesterday to make sure spots were available and that I knew how to book the tickets. 

All I was waiting for was my wife to get home from a trip so I could double check she liked my plan. She did. So today I got the plane tickets, then the TGV tickets for the first half of the train trip, then I went to [SBB.ch](http://SBB.ch) to book the sleeper compartment and it said the train was all booked already!

My question is, is there much of a chance of one of these compartments becoming available again? Should I keep checking the website, or should I start booking a plan B route?

I guess since the TGV tickets appear to be refundable up to one week out, plan C would just be to fly from Barcelona to Prague, but that's boring.

Final hours of my 16 months around the world trip,"**TLDR:** Made redundant at the end of 2022, didn't want to find another job. Packed up and travelled the world.

**update** done for now, flight soon, thanks for the questions. 

**update 2** ok really done now, boarding.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down. That coupled with the fact that we were cooped up after some of the most longest and strictest lockdowns it was time to get out and see the world.

The objective of the travels was essentially to explore and ""live"", as you will see most of the places we stayed were capital Cities. We ended up doing ALOT of day trips from the major capitals either by train or tour company. Most of the time it was much cheaper just to do a full day tour than to actually hire a car for the day.

Most of the places we stayed were booked through either [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Airbnb (booking.com was a much cheaper option most of the time)

The major itinerary is as follows (list may or may not include minor day trips)

Europe 2025 - Prague to Barcelona,"Hi everyone, 

This will be my third solo trip to Europe and am wondering how my rough itinerary looks for this upcoming May/June. Here's what I have (roughly one month):

Prague (4 nights) - Train to Salzburg

Salzburg, Austria (3 nights) - Bus to Ljubljana 

Ljubljana, Slovenia (2 nights)

Bled, Slovenia (4 nights) - Train \[from Ljubljana\] to Budapest

Budapest (5 nights) - Flight to Portugal 

Lisbon, Portugal (3 nights - my second time here!) 

Porto, Portugal (4 nights) - Super short flight to Barcelona 

Barcelona, Spain (5 nights) - Flight home, also meeting some friends in Barcelona. 

Has anyone taken the direct train from Ljubljana to Budapest? It's about 9 hours it seems, which I don't mind, but I am a little hesitant as I need to make the train early from Bled that morning in order to not miss the direct train in Ljubljana. I was thinking of going from Salzburg to Bled, but it is a 7-8 hour train ride as opposed to the 4 hour FlixBus bus ride to Ljubljana (there is a FlixBus direct to Bled, but it arrives at 10pm). 

For the record, I have explored most of Western Europe already and really want to delve into some of Central Europe and get some ""sun"" towards the end of my trip. I'm not looking so much for advice on things to do, but whether or not this route makes any sense? Should I cut anything out or restructure my itinerary in any way?

Additional destination to pair with Prague?,"Hello fellow travelers! My husband and I are in the early stages of planning a trip for next September, for about 7-8 days. We're pretty sure we want to do Prague and we're looking for another destination to pair with it. Ideally we could get to this other location by train or bus in a few hours, but have it offer a different experience from Prague. Considerations:

* Our biggest travel priorities are food, art/culture, and just looking at cool stuff while walking around. Medium priorities are history and nature (love some low-effort nature, but interest fades once it becomes camp-y or hike-y). Indifferent to ""adventure"" and nightlife (in the clubbing sense)
* We'd probably want to spend a max of about 6 hours getting to the other destination. Train or bus is preferred, but open to planes
* Day trips are fine, but we don't want to keep schlepping our stuff around, so the plan is to restrict our lodging to two hotels/Airbnbs/etc for the trip
* We were figuring on roughly a 50/50 time split, but are open to other possibilities (ie if there's something completely spectacular that you can do in a couple days, we could just stay in Prague longer)
* We're hardly wealthy, but we're financially comfortable and okay shelling out for a memorable trip

Vienna or somewhere else in Austria is the leading contender at the moment, but we're open to any suggestions! We're not afraid to go off the beaten path. Thank you!",1,4,1734542356.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hh6ii5/additional_destination_to_pair_with_prague/,julieses

First solo trip so I’m keeping it short! I’m a 26 year old woman 

August 30: Depart from Atlanta 

August 31-September 4: Budapest 

September 5: catch early AM train to Prague, arrive in the afternoon

September 8: fly back home from Prague

Ideally I would have liked to go later in September but the beginning of September works best for me schedule wise. The tickets aren’t anything crazy ($1200). And it looks like there are plenty of reasonably priced air bnbs and hostels — I have yet to decide which yet. The only thing that concerns me are the crowds and understanding the train system. 

Thoughts/ opinions? I know my family is going to act like I lost my mind tonight when I tell them. Life is too short and I’ve been through a lot recently which has put things in perspective.

Christmas eve things to do berlin and prague,"Hi All, 

I am travelling to berlin from prague. I'll be in prague 21-22 december. The plan is
23rd Reach berlin 
24-25th Do all the ""open"" things - Brandenburg gate, check point Charlie, berlin wall, memorial, east side gallery, street art, graffiti, christmas markets, clubs/christmas eve party
26th Musuems, Reichstag, Charlottenburg Palace
27th Anything missed, 7pm leave berlin

My question here is should I leave prague at the earliest and reach berlin by 11am to have more time in berlin or should I stay and explore prague? 
Will anything be open on 23rd? Initially I thought I'll do musuems on Monday but I saw all of them are generally closed on Mondays in berlin. Also a friend is joining on 24th. So I could space out some things but then I'll have to visit them again anyway with my friend. Hence the confusion

I am open to activities other than seeing tourist sights like going for some art workshop.

Tldr; where to spend major part of the dayof 23rd december prague or berlin?

Is the anti-tourism in Barcelona really that bad?,"I'm planning to go on a little trip with two of my girl friends in September. All 3 of us are from Europe and it's the first time we go on vacation together. 

We really wanted to go to a city in Europe and Barcelona seemed perfect for us. That was until we did further research and saw all the news about locals complaining about tourist, protesting and ""attacking"" tourists with water guns. That kinda put us of. 

We're not the kind of people to get really drunk and be loud in the streets late at night. But we don't wanna be somewhere, where we aren't welcome.
Or is this all mostly exaggerated by social media?

Some other cities we considered are:
- valencia
- Seville
- Rome
- Lisbon 
- Porto 

What we had in mind of doing in the city is: walking around (sightseeing), shopping, going to the beach or the park, visiting cultural monuments and maybe go out to a bar once

We're still very young and inexperienced, for my friends it's the first trip without parents (I already did a solo trip to Prague). We also know this trip is maybe quite ""last minute"", but it was also a spontaneous idea.

Need Antibiotics Urgently In Prague,"My partner and I are traveling in Prague this weekend and I just started to come down with symptoms of strep throat. It’s all the classic signs: scratchy throat, white spots on tonsils, etc. Feels just like strep I would get as a kid (it’s been a while since I’ve had it).

If I was at home, I would just go to an urgent care, get antibiotics, and NBD. But we’re scheduled to travel to a tiny ski town in Austria tomorrow morning. The medical access there is … lacking … to say the least. It’s an 8 hour train ride away and there’s one train we can take to make it there. We have to be on that train.

Within the next 24 hours, I need antibiotics for both myself and my partner (she’s bound to get this from me in the next two days). What should I do? The current plan is to go to Motol University Hospital and basically beg for meds for both of us.

On a more personal note, Covid has directly or indirectly cancelled all of my “once in a lifetime “ international trips in the last 4 years. My psyche and mental wellbeing really needs this trip to come together. It feels like the world has a personal vendetta against me having fun internationally, and I’m close to just giving up on international travel for good.",0,24,1709440106.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1b58amp/need_antibiotics_urgently_in_prague/,bosbiblebob

"How to split time between Paris, Bamberg, and Prague?","I'm going to Europe for the first time this summer and I'm having trouble figuring out how to schedule my time there. I arrive in Paris on a Thursday afternoon from NYC, and I leave Prague Saturday at noon 9 days later.  I'm taking the train from Paris to Prague, and I want to stop by a German city along the way, probably Bamberg. My problem is that I don't know how much time to plan to spend in each city. The recommendations I'm seeing online are to stay in Paris for a minimum of 4 days not counting arrival day, Prague for a minimum of 3, and Bamberg for 2. This exceeds my trip, so I need to compromise somewhere. In Paris I want to see the Louve, Eiffel Tower, Catacombs, and Museum of Paleontology, plus have time to wander around and try discover shops and places to eat. Bamberg doesn't seem to have any major attractions that I'm seeing recommened besides breweries, so I think the plan would be to wander around again and enjoy the atmosphere, food, and drinks. In Prague I want to visit the Sedlic Ossuary, plus explore the city and see the architecture and David Cerny art. Any recommendations for how much time to spend at each stop, or of things I should do that aren't on my list yet? Also, my train to Bamberg goes through Heidelburg, would it be crazy to stop for an afternoon to explore that city, or will that be cramming too much into one trip?

"Planning a 16 day trip to Europe this March to Berlin, Prague, Krakow and Budapest","I was wondering if you guys had any advice and if this plan is viable?

I'm going with a friend. The current plan is this:

* Spend the first 5 days in Berlin (with a day trip to Leipzig in between).
* From there we'll take the train down to Prague, and spend 3 days there.
* We'll take a domestic flight to Krakow, where we'll be for another 3 days.
* Then, we'll take yet another domestic flight to Budapest where we intend to stay for 3 or 4 days in total (haven't fully decided on this one yet).
* Finally, we'll take a flight back to Berlin where we'll fly back to the US the next day.

Is this a viable plan for 16 days? We were actually going to go 14 days originally, but we extended it to 16 so we can more easily fit in Krakow (in particular so we can see Auschwitz). I understand four locations in one trip is a lot, but I feel like 16 days should be enough to cover it. But I figured I'd ask others for their thoughts on this.

Also: In Budapest, we haven't decided if we'll take a day trip to Bratislava since that's only 2 hours away. We thought it might be cool to cross off another country on the trip. Would that be a good idea, or should we just stick to Budapest while we're there and save Bratislava for another trip?",6,24,1703829757.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18tg09l/planning_a_16_day_trip_to_europe_this_march_to/,UltimateLazer

"Any places that are great to visit DESPITE the food? Any places you visited that were awful, but the food alone made it worthwhile?","Somewhat inspired by the recent question about places that you wanted to enjoy hard, but couldn't: 

I wanted to have a good time in Budapest, but just couldn't. It wasn't bad in any sense, but having been to e.g. Vienna, Prague, and a bunch of other cities in the region it just didn't stand out that much. BUT: one thing that really hit home though was the food - anything from the more stereotypically traditional Hungarian dishes and the wine, to ""new Hungarian"" cuisine and the dozens of ways to cook  catfish from Lake Balaton.

2) Conversely, many parts of upper/mountainous Central Asia, e.g. the High Pamirs in Tajikistan/Kyrgyzstan, the Wakhan Corridor bordering Afghanistan etc. were some of the most beautiful places that I have ever been to in my life, with only few other places on our planet coming close in my opinion. Despite the gorgeous scenery and the incredible hospitality of the local populations however the food has been awful. Of course, these are remote regions with limited agriculture and wide-spread poverty, but even in some of the more fertile and accessible parts of e.g. Tajikistan you'd be lucky to find more than the same 2-4 dishes done more or less well.

Any place in particular that stood out to you on either side of the scale? Any place that would make it worthwhile to visit just for the food alone, versus places that are so magnificent that even a foodie would enjoy them in spite of the lack of good food options?

Honeymoon to Prague/Vienna/Budapest - seeking advice on Vienna leg,"Hi everyone! My husband (39M) and myself (35F) have planned our honeymoon to Central Europe (flying in to Prague, flying out of Budapest) from 6 to 19 December and I was wondering if anyone had any advice. As some context, we are based in Malaysia and this will be the longest time either of us has spent in Europe, so super excited! (Husband has spent time in Munich and Wattens in Austria for work and I have only spent half a day in London on a layover). We both love the cold weather, and enjoy sightseeing, history and sampling tons of local food. Husband also enjoys driving, so we usually rent a car for some part of our holidays so he can experience driving on local roads.

So far, our plan is to spend 4 nights these cities to give ourselves enough time to enjoy each place instead of rushing from place to place:

· Prague – Arrive on the 6th in the early morning, leave on the 10th

· Vienna – Arrive 10th and leave on the 14th

· Budapest – Arrive 14th and leave on 18th (early morning)

However, I’ve been toying with the idea of heading out of Vienna to see some of the beautiful landscapes and also to mix it up instead of just experiencing big cities and architecture for two weeks. So far, I’ve considered these options

1. Day trip to Hallstatt (I don’t think I’d like to lug bags all the way there and looks like a day trip is enough)

2. Stay in a nice lakeside resort in Zell am See for one or two nights of the Vienna leg; if we have time, then to make a stop at Hallstatt on the way there

I’m thinking for either of those options we will rent a car and make a road trip out of it. I’m aware many consider these two places very touristy, so happy to hear any alternatives too.

Advice on Austria and Prague in Nov/Dec or other suggestions? ,"My husband will be in Stockholm for work and I will be visiting him the last week of November/First week of December. We plan on meeting in Stockholm and from there we have 6 days Thursday-Tuesday where we want to visit two other cities. We’re aware this time of year can be pretty depressing weather (As my Swedish friend said it’ll be cold dark and everyone is depressed lol) but since it’s through work we don’t have much flexibility with the timing.
 
That being said what are some cities in Central/Eastern Europe that would still be nice to see that time of year? We both love food and enjoy art, architecture, history and are pretty social we don’t mind the cold but trying to avoid coastal/rainy areas.

Are Prague and Vienna that we are considering good options?
The art and architecture looks beautiful and I like that they’ll have the Christmas markets and overall a festive holiday vibe. But would love to hear thoughts on traveling there that time of the year is it worth it or cheesy? Do we need both? and any other suggestions. Open to smaller cozier cities that we can get to by train as well and anywhere that will have snow.
 
If we do end up going with Prague and Vienna which do you think is better to go to for weekend vs weekdays? Not sure if it matters but I know some cities can be better or worse depending on how crowded they get on the weekends since our first leg will be either be Thurs- Sat or Sun trying to optimize our time.

Poland itinerary + Prague/Amsterdam?,"Looking to get some thoughts on an itinerary for my family's winter trip this year. We have decided to take my inlaws to Poland to celebrate my father-in-laws retirement, as he has always wanted to go for the family history there.

As of now, the only things set in stone are the dates, which are two weeks starting 11/24, and a stopover in Amsterdam for a few days on the way back because it is the place my mother-in-law has always wanted to go most to see the artwork. It will be the two of them, my wife and I, and our 1.5 year old daughter (which means we will be limited in what we can do).

Planned activities are Christmas markets, Auschwitz, and general wandering around. No big plans otherwise. I am trying to figure out if we can fit in Prague on this trip, and wanted to get thoughts on that front. 

Tentatively our itinerary is:

11/24 - redeye to Gdansk
11/25 - Gdansk
11/26 - Gdansk
11/27 - Gdansk to Krakow
11/28 - Krakow
11/29 - Krakow
11/30 - Krakow to Wroclaw
12/1 - Wroclaw
12/2 - Wroclaw to Prague
12/3 - Prague
12/4 - Prague
12/5 - Prague to Amsterdam
12/6 - Amsterdam 
12/7 - Amsterdam
12/8 - Amsterdam to Home (8.5 hour direct flight)

I am debating whether it is worth it to try to squeeze Prague in with a 1.5 year old, or if we should take it out and spend extra time in Poland - either adding that time to the cities we will be visiting, or adding somewhere like Torun or Zakopane into the mix.

Prague versus Spain in late April,"My wife and I are taking a trans-Atlantic cruise in April next year that ends in Barcelona.  We will have spent a few days in Barcelona on a prior trip (that also involves stops in La Coruna, Malaga and Ibiza) so we want to take a few days to explore someplace else after we disembark from this TA.  At most I'm looking at having 5 days available.

Right now I'm thinking about a couple of options.  One is to fly from Barcelona to Prague and to spend 3 days in Prague before flying home.  (I'll mention my dad pitched Prague as an option and it seems like an interesting city, so that's why a choice that is over 1000 miles away is being considered).  The other is to take the high speed train from Barcelona to either Seville or Cordoba and then take the train to Madrid to fly out from there.

I suppose the weather in Prague may be less pleasant than Spain that time of year, so that would be a factor.  A question would be, after only visiting coastal cities in Spain, is the atmosphere in those inland cities unique such that visiting them would still be a new experience?  I'm also curious how easy and secure is it to take the train in Spain with a couple of 50lb suitcases.

Any thoughts on which trip sounds best, or any alternatives that might be better?",0,7,1720888048.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e2efgm/prague_versus_spain_in_late_april/,Tralfaz1138

2. From Budapest to Salzburg, which mode of transport is more cost effective vs. number or hours? Coach Bus or Train? Am not entirely sure yet as I haven't delved into research.
3. Do recommend any other changes (side day trips, other cities to consider within this itinerary etc.) or hidden gems we should visit!

Better day trip from Prague: Bohemian Switzerland or Cesky Krumlov?,"Hi, all!

In a couple of weeks I will be on a 2.5 week trip to Switzerland, Austria, and the Czech Republic. I will be in the Bernese Oberland for several days hiking and doing outdoor activities, then will head to Salzburg and Vienna/Melk for more cultural/historical activities. My last stop will be Prague (arrive on 9/30 and leave 10/5). I want to be sure I am not cramming too much on my trip but am able to slow down and get a little lost in the local things. I enjoy a mix of the outdoors and city life, so I am trying to strike that balance on this trip.

My question is about a day trip from Prague. I think it's probably prudent to just do 1 day trip with the time I have, and I have narrowed it down to Bohemian Switzerland and Cesky Krumlov. Both seem to have wildly different vibes, yet in my research, both are believed to be pretty ""must-see"" spots. I like that Bohemian Switzerland has breathtaking views, but I also see only great things about the uniqueness of Cesky Krumlov, particularly in the shoulder season. I want to see more of the Czech Republic than Prague, and both places appear to fit the bill.

I would love any insight from folks who have some familiarity of the area. Which stop do you think would be a better choice for the trip I have laid out?

Berlin/Prague/Vienna/Budapest,"Hi everyone -

My husband and I are planning a two week trip in late spring. It seems as though airfare is cheapest to fly in and out of Berlin so that’s the tentative plan. 

We were thinking of spending four days in Berlin, three days in Prague, three days in Vienna, and three days in Budapest. Is this cramming too much in one trip though? 

When on vacation we really enjoy driving and exploring the countryside. Also enjoy hiking, museums, World War II, history, museums, castles. Not so big on nightlife, but do enjoy good meals as most people do. 

Are we crazy to want to drive the entire trip? Often we plan our trips in a loop so that we’re not seeing the same sites both ways. This trip does not lend itself to that as much. Should we eliminate one of these cities? I feel like this trip would be much more doable with an open jaw flight. But those are much more expensive and there would be the additional expense of renting a car in one location and dropping it off in another.

Advice greatly appreciated!",2,23,1697826667.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17ci25a/berlinpragueviennabudapest/,lefty709

Next stop Innsbruck,  I think... Dec 26 - Dec 30? or I can just make this the base for the remainder of the stay.

I really wanted to go to northern Italy as well. I'm considering going to Italy before Innsbruck for  3 days or maybe at the end but then I'm farther from return airport.
