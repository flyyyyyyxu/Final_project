First trip to Vienna. Any advices?,"Hello everyone, 

Me and some friends are going to visit Vienna next month. We've been looking for activities and places to visit. So far we've planned going to Schonbrunn, the Zoo and the Prater.

We're staying for a week, so we've got some more time.

What else would you recommend?
Also are any of the passes worth? For example Schonbrunn+zoo+public transport? Or is it better to just pay separately?

Thank you in advance and sorry if it's not the right place for this post.",63,92,1692358875.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15ui6s6/first_trip_to_vienna_any_advices/,xFloddy

My trip to Vienna ,"Last week I was from Monday to Friday in Vienna. I did go by train and there wasn't any problem. I did so many museum, the formula 1 exhibition, culture and art natural history museum, schönnbrunn palace, Sisi Museum,... It was so great. Thank God I didn't had to wait much when I purchased the tickets. The paintings were so beautiful, you just stand there and watch it's very fascinating. Only on the first day there was a weirdo like a 40 year old man, I was at train station he came and said you are a sexy guy... That already was very weird. We got in the train before his stop came he winked and asked me, If I could give him my number, I said no and then he left. Besides that there was nothing, everything went as planned and it was a good time. Here are a few little tips if you want to travel alone:

1.) Do as much research as you possibly can! Know where you wanna stay, how long, what you wanna see, how you go there, if train, which ticket you can purchase, how much the ticket cost, how to buy a ticket, how you go from hotel to the centre for example, what you do there, what you eat,... Know as much as you can. It will help you alot, it made my trip so much easier cause I knew what I wanted to see, how I get there,... 

2.) don't plan too much! I planned every day only 2 activities so I still have a few hours for myself. Don't rush things, take your time if it's 3 hours okey fine, you're on vacation. Wake up when you want, do what you want, it's your vacation. I knew for example when my legs start to hurt that it's slowly time to get back to the hotel.

3.) don't let anyone close! Be always safe, aware of your surroundings, never go anywhere with headphones, don't put your phone or wallet in a pocket, always in a small bag. Always check if you have anything and don't let anyone know you travel alone! If a strangers asks, hotel receptionist,... Always tell you gonna meet a friend, partner, family member and travel with them! 

I now wanna plan my next trip... Still in Europe so if anyone can give me some recommendations I'm open, we can exchange experiences things like that and we can chat private or in the comments^^ 

I hope you find it interesting and if you have any questions feel free to ask me

Vienna is a bad tourist city,"I went to Vienna for a few days and I am not rushing back. I loved the architecture and the history, but as a tourist city it is not great. I found the infrastructure confusing to navigate, I was constantly looking at maps (on my phone because there are few pavement ones). There is next to no signs giving place names, building names or tourist orientated signs. The roads look like the pavement, sometimes you have to cross 5 crossings just to cross 1 road. Cycling is great, but pedestrians are an afterthought. I had to dodge cyclists, trams, even cars going through red. I really appreciate London’s signs and infrastructure now. Also, shops shut at 8pm (at least where I was). UK shops shut early, but this is surprising especially for corner stores. Money wise, it is not a shock that it is an expensive city, but you at looking at £15+ for each attraction if you don’t get a pass. There is no way to do this city on a budget.",0,6,1663269961.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xf5i07/vienna_is_a_bad_tourist_city/,sirhappyqueen02

Money stolen from my hotel room in Vienna,"
I am a dumbass and left 300 euros and 300,000 hungarian forint in my backpack instead of the safe and tonight I found out the cash is gone.

I have left cash in an unlocked place in my hotel plenty times before, but i guess this is my expensive lesson. Don’t be like me and always lock your cash in your safe. Such a bummer to an amazing trip otherwise. 

FYI, I am staying at the Leonardo Hotel Vienna. I just brought this up to the hotel staff and it will be escalated to the management in the morning, but I am not hopeful on getting my money back.

Edit: I saw on some youtube video that I would want cash in Hungary. Well, that is not the case apparently 😅  Probably best idea to minimize the amount of cash at all.

Edit 2: Very much expected response from the management. Nothing can be done on their end really. It was uncomfortable to see the manager and a lady who seems to be a housekeeping crew chit chat and giggle though… Going to the police station to report shortly. 

Final update: it seems like the hotel does this on the regular. I have seen other people’s reviews that they also had their belongings stolen from their rooms.",658,192,1713394960.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1c6o0yv/money_stolen_from_my_hotel_room_in_vienna/,richhomiequon12

Temptress croissants in Vienna — a cultural thing or a mini scam?,"Of all my travels over the years, one of the only times I ever felt scammed (aside from a taxi in Rome) was eating at one of the grand cafes in Vienna a decade ago. I ordered a full breakfast, and the waiter placed a croissant under my nose along with it. I ate the croissant, the waiter came over, let out a “hmmm,” and then brought me the the bill with what felt at the time like an exorbitant charge tacked on (though in retrospect was probably 3 euros max — I was broke-ish). 

It’s such a small, stupid thing, but I’ve always wondered if that was a cultural misunderstanding on my part (Vienna, Central Europe thing?), or if I fell into a mini tourist trap scam. 

Loved Vienna overall.

Edit: Thanks all, the responses here suggest it’s not uncommon in some areas in Germany and Austria, usually for bread baskets, less common since covid, and that this was a (reasonable enough) cultural misunderstanding on my part. Mystery solved. 

I should also note I’ve lived in Europe most of my adult life (Spain, Netherlands, Belgium) and I get that different places do different things— hence the framing of the question.",223,188,1707010100.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1aiby86/temptress_croissants_in_vienna_a_cultural_thing/,fiffers

"Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Vienna, or Zurich","I am planning a trip for April 2026 of approximately 2 weeks in length. I currently have an itinerary of Rome-Barcelona. On a previous trip to Europe we visited Prague (liked), Paris (didn’t like), Florence (liked), Rome (liked).  I have previously been to Copenhagen as well, which I enjoyed. My SO spent quite a bit of time in Switzerland 30+ years ago, but I’ve not been.

We talked about going back to Rome someday, hence the current itinerary. However, this is going to be only our second trip to Europe as a couple (first trip was >10 years ago) and we don’t get to travel to Europe very often. We also have a friend in London that we’d like to visit so I am considering replacing Rome with another city to see other parts of Europe and adding London, and would like some advice on which city to possibly substitute.

About us:
- We prefer not to move hotels too often, so we want to be in a city 3-5 full days and move at a more relaxed pace
- we like food, culture, and museums (art and national history, not the more niche ones like spy museums etc). A museum visit will likely take most of our day unless it’s really small
- walking yes biking no
- Hyatt globalist and Marriott Platinum, but could really use the nights for Hyatt so that would be my strong preference 

I am building an alternate itinerary to bring up with my SO. Between Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Vienna, and Zurich, which one should I add to London and Barcelona, and what makes you say that?

Vienna & Budapest 12 night - should I split half and half or spend more time in Vienna?,"I am taking my 78 old year mom to visit Vienna and Budapest during the first two week of May. We are staying twelve night. I am debating whether I should I split my trip evenly between the city? or is there more to do in Vienna than Budapest? I was think of doing 7 day in Vienna (including 1 day trip to Bratislava) and 5 (half day for transfer) day in Budapest. Considering we are not going to doing much on the day of landing and lost half a day on the transfer to Budapest, we would have 6 full days in Vienna and 5/4.5 day in Budapest.

We are not into hiking, party, drinking or luxury shopping (local souvenir is fine). We like to see architecture, stroll around the old town, eat local food, coffee, and look at local stuffs. My mom has high blood pressure, not sure if she can do the thermal bath, but I would like to try it.

Edit:

I am taking the trip at a slow pace, most like one big attraction (palace) per day. I am open for short day trip. Not going to do Salzburg as the commute is long for my mom's standard. Don't want to add another city. Changing 3 locations was too much for my mom. We visited three cities in Spain last time and although she didn't complaint, I call tell it had taken a toll on her. So going to keep is simpler this time.

I learned my lesson last trip that changing hotel reservation is like canceling  a flight and booking at the current rate, meaning at a higher price most likely. Hence, I kind have to decide how to split the nights now. Adjusting hotel later on is a pain. How Expedia system works is not simply adding a day or subtracting a day. The system need to find the  another available room with the same dates in order to adjust dates.  What I can do is split the hotel reservation at Vienna and Budapest with an extra day  on a separate reservation so when I need to cancel it does not affect the price on the rest of the nights.",5,69,1738962002.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ik5k6d/vienna_budapest_12_night_should_i_split_half_and/,naiwenzh

Vienna: The worst city ever in terms of service staff and general hospitality,"We are on vacation in Vienna; so far, everything is great except for being a tourist in any café, bar, pub, or restaurant.

I don't want to blame anyone, or I know that I am the ""foreigner"" here and cannot change or advise anything, but since the start of our visit, we have always felt uncomfortable sitting in an establishment awaiting service.

I must say that I work in the service industry as well, and I know very well the hardships of this job and can understand how frustrating people can be. I deal with them every day; additionally, I deal with them in the air, in a confined flying metal tube.

But the overall experience is quite disheartening for someone unfamiliar with this culture.


- Everything is extremely slow. You enter a restaurant; you just have to wait for them to acknowledge you and show you where you can sit. But they are not in a hurry! Then, when you are directed to your table, you wait for them to greet you and give you your menu. Then you make up your mind, and you wait for the waiter to take your order.

I guess people normalized this as the ""vibe of the city,"" but this looks and feels really bad from a tourist's perspective. We started dreading entering restaurants at some point. 

- The other day, a lady spilled her beer near me, and the waiter saw it but kept talking with the people he was talking to. Another guy and I had to shout for help because she was in distress, but the waiter came after one or two minutes, apologizing and saying he was talking to other customers.

-  I ordered a meal in a fancy restaurant, and the grumpy waiter made me feel very unwelcome with his gestures and attitude. I politely told him I could take the beer before my meal; he looked at me and said, ""Of course, you will get it beforehand; we need time to prepare the meal,"" in a mocking way.

Then, when I was paying, he said, ""Would you like to help me, maybe?"" showing the tip page of the credit card device. I thanked him and we left. After this kind of a service, these guys really directly ask you to tip them, which is low-key hilarious. This happened to me more than 10 times maybe.


- Today we entered a restaurant near Schönbrunn for breakfast. When we were directed to our seats, and when the waiter thought this was the right time to take our orders, we gave our orders. Then I said I would love to have my beer beforehand if possible. He said sure and vanished. After literally fifteen minutes, I told another waiter, ""I guess they forgot my beer; I would love to have it, if possible,"" in an extremely polite way. The waiter said, ""I don't think they forgot it; we are busy right now, thats why."" I said, ""But it's been more than fifteen minutes..."" She didnt say anything went and brought my drink instantly, but her body language was quite offensive (it was low-key funny, and i guess i unwillingly ruined her day.) She smashed our drinks onto the table.  And the guy who took our order was in sight, doing literally nothing but looking at his computer monitor and phone.

Then they made us literally wait for more than half an hour to bring two small breakfasts.

I have been to several countries, seen great services and service industry workers, and never seen anything like this anywhere. If you really need the tip from a customer, maybe you should try to make your customers have good experiences at your establishment. That would definitely increase your chances.


If you value kindness from those around you when you visit a new country or you value generally good customer experiences, avoid this city at all costs.",0,26,1748268856.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kvvf1q/vienna_the_worst_city_ever_in_terms_of_service/,Ztepi

"Advice on travel itinerary to Budapest, Vienna, Salzburg, Munich (+ Frankfurt?)","Currently planning a 10-night trip to the above locations; details on Budapest/Vienna have been set, but fairly uncertain about the last few legs of our trip. Would love some feedback! Here is the current itinerary (overlap days are travel days, where we plan to leave in the early morning and arrive in the new location by 11am)

1. 8/4 - 8/7 in Budapest
2. 8/7 - 8/10 in Vienna
3. 8/10 - 8/11 in Salzburg
4. 8/11 - 8/14 in Munich/Frankfurt

My main questions are about Salzburg/Munich/Frankfurt:

* I want to stay in Munich to take advantage of day trips in the area (primarily Zugspitze/Eibsee and Neuschwanstein/Linderhof) but we don't have a car, so it'll be 2.5 hour travel both ways for each trip, which would take two full days. Is that worth it? I've seen advice online about traveling to Neuschwanstein/Linderhof on the first day, then staying overnight at Oberammergau, then heading to Ga-Pa for Zugspitze the day after. Is that better? (And if so, where would we put our suitcases while going around during the day since it'll be an overnight?) Would booking two day-long tour groups be better and easier? Also, is it worth doing a day trip to see some towns on the Romantic Road like Rothenburg ob der Tauber on a tour?
* On the other hand, we could skip Zugspitze in favor of Jennerbahn + Konigsee, which is 1-hour train from Salzburg. Would that be better? If so, should we go the first day in Salzburg, or the day after? If the day after, again, where would we store our suitcases while going up the Jennerbahn (given that we'd be leaving our hotel that morning)? Should we stay another night in Salzburg or head to Munich directly after? Is the Zugspitze worth the extra travel, or will Jennerbahn + Konigsee be good, too? 
* Frankfurt has direct flights home, whereas Munich doesn't (layover in Frankfurt), so we were thinking it might be nicer to take a train to Frankfurt the day before we leave, explore that area a bit, then fly out at around 5PM back home. Is that worth the hassle of another train ride + cutting down time in Munich/nearby day trips? Are the views worth it? And what should we do in Frankfurt? 
* Would it be worth cutting a day in Budapest/Vienna to leave more time for the second half of the itinerary?

Thank you so much for the feedback! We need to book flights ASAP so hoping for some clear sense of direction on this. ",1,12,1750193319.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ldygjm/advice_on_travel_itinerary_to_budapest_vienna/,Ecstatic_Proof_3774
Amsterdam to Vienna in an Environmentally Friendly Way,"Hi there!

I live in the Netherlands (near Amsterdam), and a friend of mine is currently doing an exchange semester in Vienna. He invited me to visit, and it sounds like a lot of fun! I’m planning to go sometime in May. I’m flexible with the dates.

I’m struggling to find an environmentally friendly way to travel there. These seem to be my options:

* Plane (€300, 2 hours, no transfers) - Not eco-friendly at all.
* Train (€140, \~12 hours, 1 transfer) - Trains run on green energy!
* Bus (€110, \~24 hours, no transfers) - Not really a great option.

The train seems like the obvious choice, even with a 2-hour transfer. But before I book, I wanted to check: am I missing any other good ways to travel from Amsterdam to Vienna?

We're partially going on this trip to assess how we like Lisbon as a potential long term destination to live in, so want to spend at least 5 days there to get a feel for the city. All that said, fitting in the other locations might make things too crammed. Right now my itinerary is:

\*-3 days in Ljubljana area (plus a day trip to Lake Bled)

\*-3 days in Salzburg area (explore the area and do a day trip to Hallstadt)

\*-3 days in Vienna area (also interested in a day trip to Bratislava)

Fly to Lisbon

\*5 days in Lisbon (spend time exploring the city, getting a feel for what it'd be like living there)

\*3 days in Madeira (nature/outdoors stuff, explore the island with hopefully fewer crowds)

\*Fly home.

\*We're more nature/outdoorsy folk than city people but enjoy a variety of settings and activities more than anything. My concern with this itinerary is that we're jumping around too much by only staying in spots 3 nights, but it'd be a nice way to squeeze all of these destinations in. Would love to get feedback if we should chop one spot or other itinerary tweaks.",1,9,1750487478.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lgpy8f/which_to_cut_for_17_day_october_trip_salzburg/,Thewondrouswizard
"Frankfurt and Vienna layover, enough time?","Hello,

I am thinking on flying to RMO from TSR, via MUC and FRA. Connecting flight from FRA to RMO is 1 h 10 min. Lufthansa is the operator here.

Return is from RMO to VIE with 45 minutes layover for the next leg, VIE to MUC. Operator, this time, is Austrian. 

Is there enough time for passport control? Never been to FRA nor VIE, but I am thinking that at least in VIE there should be e-gates to fasten up the process.

Only carry-on.

I don’t know why I don’t love Vienna,"I’m 20 and have began traveling across Europe in 2022. Been all over Ireland, Italy, Austria, Czechia, Armenia, Hungary, and more. From these, I’ve been to Vienna the most (twice). The architecture is stunning, I’d say the best (behind some of Italy). So I’m trying to figure out now why I don’t “love” this city. Something about it just doesn’t click or resonate with me. I don’t think Budapest is architecturally better or cleaner, but I’d go back to Budapest in a heart beat while I didn’t even think twice when my Vienna trip ended. I haven’t had a bad experience and am in awe at how organized and neat Vienna looks.

I would be there on a Sunday and imagine it will be packed with tourists but it does look pretty. 


- Take high speed train to Salzburg. Spend a few hours exploring the city and do the “Sound of Music” tour to see the towns of Mondsee and St. Gilgen.

Vienna vs Budapest vs Prague Christmas markets,"Trip report: I have just returned from several days in each of these cities, seeing their Christmas markets. My initial reactions are that Vienna has the least inspiring markets.  Lots of apparently identical booths, some selling goods that don't seem to be local, and heavy on just a few foods.

Budapest Christmas markets were much better. You could get far better food and there was a greater variety, including booths that seem to be one of a kind and local-ish. Salmon roasting over wood fires was especially good. People seemed to be having a lot of fun.

Prague's markets were also very good but smaller than Budapest. Still lots of good food and original/local goods.

Which should you visit? Budapest if you are young and also want to party. Prague, if you have a little more cash to spend and aren't so interested in clubs. I personally find Prague to be a more charming town, but was far more impressed by Budapest than I expected to be.  Will likely return to both.

Vienna or Amsterdam as a female solo traveler (in July)?,"Hi! I’m a uni student who’s planning on solo traveling next summer - early July to be specific. 

I would like to visit Vienna or Amsterdam but can’t decide… I need to fly on Lufthansa so it would be Munich-Vienna or Frankfurt-Amsterdam.

I’ve been to Vienna (and other cities in Austria) as well but it was when I was younger, and I think the familiarity would help me on my first ever solo trip. 

I’ve never been to Netherlands, so it would be nice to have a new experience. Plus I will visit Rotterdam as well if I choose this. 

Things I have to consider:

Accommodation - I want clean and safe hotel. Novotel or other 4 star business hotels. But I heard Amsterdam is more expensive than Vienna…

Racism & Overall Safety - I’m an Asian woman so… I never had unpleasant experience in any part of Austria but was wondering about Amsterdam. 

Sightseeing - My visit will be about a week long and won’t move around the country so it would be nice if the city is filled with tourist attractions.

City Travel Vienna for my Grandparents,"Hey there Reddit,

I want to gift my grandparents a travel to Vienna because they often talked about how they would like to visit the city.

Does someone here have experience with a Travel Agency who is specialized in organizing such Travels for older people? I really dont want to book an infamous ""bus Travel"" where they bascially ship them around for 5 days and bring them home. They should have the possibility to experience the City by themself (but with a little bit of a Guideline perhaps).

I cant seem to find such a Travel agency, but perhaps I'm just blind. Would be awesome if you could share your experiences with me! If there is no such agency I will just plan it myself, but still, Insights would be cool, thanks in advance!

Some background Information: Me and my Grandparents live in North Germany. So I also need to organize the trip to Vienna itself. Also my Grandfather needs to walk with a Stick and has a walking aid(He only needs that if he has to walk longer distances without the possibility to sit down, but I guess in Vienna should exist enough possibilities), so I need to consider that for the Travel in Vienna itself.",1,5,1748538742.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kygbtn/city_travel_vienna_for_my_grandparents/,Salty-Elk-1204

* Belvedere Palace
* Schonbrunn Palace (gardens and interior)
* Palais Kinsky
* Kunst Haus Wien

Thoughts on my Vienna itinerary?,"Hi friends! 26F currently travelling through central europe with my husband - we just finished Prague, and now we're in Budapest having a blast. We're going to leave in a few days to Vienna so I wanted everyone's thoughts on this itinerary. We love history, experiences (we've done things like skydiving in Dubai, making pasta in Florence, or even just doing a tour with an art historian about Gaudi in Barcelona) and we really enjoy meeting new people.

Here's my rough itinerary for Vienna - honestly please let me know your thoughts because I could be super off here LOL:

**Day 1**

\- get to hotel, check in and chill by 1 PM; after that we're going to do a walking tour of old town (this will take us through ideally st stephen's cathedral, the graben, kartner strass, hofburg palace exterior, etc)

\- if we get lucky, standing room tickets at the opera

**Day 2**

**-** bright and early Schönbrunn Palace (Get there *early* to beat the crowds. Book tickets ahead for the Grand Tour with the imperial rooms) - maybe strudel show + zoo

\- we'll take a break and then do the hofburg palace complex + maybe the spanish riding school

**Day 3**

– Visit Belvedere Palace to see Klimt’s *The Kiss* and wander the gardens

\- afternoon we're going to do MuseumsQuartier -  go into the Leopold Museum or just lounge around the MQ courtyard with a coffee.

\- Go for an evening concert : a Mozart/Strauss concert in a palace or at the Musikverein.

**Day 4**

\- honestly so far I'm keeping this day empty - we don't have anything planned so let me know if I should do anything else!",1,9,1744305654.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jw3dct/thoughts_on_my_vienna_itinerary/,sassyexec
Vienna advice!,"My partner and I will be visiting Vienna in a few weeks time for 3 nights, and looking for advice on best area to stay in.

Happy and able to walk 15 minutes to get to things, happy with public transport as I can see it's relatively widespread and easy to get.

  
Will we experience much difference staying between the two? 1st is naturally more expensive and there's much more availability in 7th at the moment for our price range, though just don't want to base ourselves too 'far' from anything and rely too much on walking far to get where we want to be.

  
Looking for a few days of just wandering, exploring, interjected by stop offs at cafes, coffee shops etc. etc.

Also anyone with experience of gigs at Wiener Stadthalle? We have front standing tickets, though as mentioned my partner is pregnant so ideally will be positioning ourselves at the back/to the side so a little more out of the way (not in the thick of it). Never been before, so anyone with experience of how the front section is usually set up would be appreciated (i.e. presuming we'll have room if we're positioned near the back/side of the front section still?)

I’m a 29-year-old Palestinian male, born and raised in Saudi Arabia. I’ll be traveling to Milan for a business trip from January 27th to 31st. After that, I have one week for vacation, and I’m planning my first-ever solo trip—a dream I’ve had since childhood to travel alone and explore places on my own.

Last summer, I visited Milan and Rome and explored all the major attractions, so this time I’m looking for something different. I’ve come up with a tentative plan but could use some advice or suggestions to make it better.

Here’s my plan:

* **January 31st**: Fly from Milan to Vienna and stay for one night.
* **February 1st**: Take a train from Vienna to Budapest and stay there for three nights (until February 4th).
* **February 4th**: Travel by train from Budapest to Prague, stopping in Bratislava for a day trip (no overnight stay). Spend two nights in Prague.
* **February 6th**: Return to Vienna for one night, as there’s a direct flight from Vienna to Riyadh the next day.

I’m a little nervous about the planning and would love suggestions. Does this itinerary sound good, or is there a better route or alternative destinations you’d recommend? Your advice would be greatly appreciated!

We have two questions for those of you who have traveled to the area. If it helps, I would say we are a fairly active couple. Thank you!

1. **Do you think it is worth it given our timing to spend a night or two in Vienna? We are torn between Option 1 and Option 2 below**. We initially planned trip just for Prague/Budapest but realized the train runs through Vienna but are torn whether to stop there for a couple nights.
2. If we were to go with Option 2, and have that extra day in **Prague/Budapest, are there any quick day trips you all would recommend so we can experience something other than just the city?** We were looking at Kutná Hora or Bohemian and Saxon Switzerland National Park but are curious if there are different ones people would recommend.

**-----Option 1 - Stopping in Vienna---**

**Prague  (3 nights - 2  full days)**

* Sunday March 30 - land 11am
* Monday March 31
* Tuesday April 1
* Wednesday April 2 - take train and go to Vienna (4 hour train ride)

**Vienna  (2 nights - 1 full  day)**

* Wednesday April 2 - arrive in afternoon 
* Thursday April 3
* Leave Friday April 4 (2.5 hour train to Vienna)

**Budapest (3 nights - 2 full days)**

* Friday April 4 - arrive in afternoon
* Saturday April 5
* Sunday April 6
* Monday April 7 (leave)

**----Option 2 - No stopping in Vienna---**

**Prague  (4 nights - 3  full days)**

* Sunday March 30 - land 11am
* Monday March 31
* Tuesday April 1
* Wednesday April 2
* Thursday April 3 - leave (7 hour train ride)

**Budapest (4 nights - 3 full days)**

* Thursday April 3 - arrive
* Friday April 4
* Saturday April 5
* Sunday April 6
* Monday April 7 (leave)",2,16,1739109666.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ilfbmv/question_for_those_who_have_traveled_to_prague/,IOQuestion

Portugal in February? Or Prague/Vienna?,"Hello. I'm organizing my traveling schedule for 2025 and I'm having this dichotomy. I need to take holidays before March and I'm between these two options.

I was organizing a trip to Portugal last year but it became too bloated: I wanted to see Lisbon and Porto but also Cascais, Sintra and visit the beaches in Setúbal and Algarve. I didn't begin planning the Prague/Vienna trip yet

I'm interested in visiting the old cities, castles and museums but also do some trekking in nature. I'd prefer not going somewhere too cold for this since I don't have winter equipment for trekking. I was wondering if Prague/Vienna is a good option for that anyway, perhaps some town, resort or something in Austria or Czech Republic would offer the same experience as Sintra.

I'm traveling from Dublin and my budget is in the ~€700 for a week or less

Is the Vienna State Opera worth visiting?,"Planning a trip to Vienna for my partner’s Christmas present, and wondering if it would be worth booking for us to see a show at the State Opera House during our visit. Neither of us have ever been to an Opera before so it’d be a brand new experience, though the price is putting me off being at least €90 each if not much more. Given the dates we’re going, Tosca or Romeo & Juliet would be the choices.

"Winter Jacket for December Trip to Budapest, Vienna, Bratislava, and Prague","Hi everyone!

I’ll be traveling in December (4th-14th) to Budapest, Vienna, Bratislava, and Prague, and I need help figuring out what clothing I’ll need to stay warm. Since I’m from a warmer country (winter temperatures here are usually around 6-8°C), I don’t own any winter jackets and want to make sure I’m prepared.

I’m considering buying a **3-in-1 jacket** like:

* The North Face Evolve II Triclimate DryVent
* Columbia Element Blocker III Interchange (blue)

But I’m worried that these might not be warm enough for the temperatures there. I don’t want to invest in a very heavy jacket, as I won’t use it much back home. Alternatively, I’ve thought about buying **separate layers**: a warmer midlayer for insulation and a waterproof/windproof outer layer to handle rain and wind.

My plan is to wear a thermal base layer and a long-sleeve shirt underneath the jacket.

**Questions:**

* Do you think a 3-in-1 jacket is a good option for these cities in December, or would I be better off with separate layers?
* Are the jackets I mentioned warm enough for this type of winter, or should I invest in something heavier?
* Any specific jacket recommendations?

"Munich, Salzburg, Vienna options","My friend and I are planning our first trip abroad as a present for our 30th birthdays in the last year. We are planning on May 2-May 9 and leaving from Minneapolis. 
 
We are set on visiting and flying into Munich as it seems most economical but have been pretty up in the air for everything else. Right now we are thinking of: 

Leave MSP May 2nd
Arrive Munich May 3rd
Depart Munich for Salzburg May 5th
Depart Salzburg for Vienna May 6th
Depart Vienna for MSP May 9th (possible day trip to Bratislava in there)

We have considered making Munich our home base, taking day trips, and skipping Vienna altogether. Or splitting time between Munich and Salzburg. 

We do not drink and are not into night life. We are foodies. Looking forward to the beautiful architecture, exploring the culture via unique museums (not so much art museums), castles, and tours. Would love to explore the Alps and the natural beauty of the area but are inexperienced hikers. More of a ride-a-tram-to-top-of-mountain-for-beautiful-sights-or-short-walk kind of travelers. 

Innsbruck & Hallstatt have interested me as well but we are unsure how easy they are to get to by train/worth going out of the way for. 

Is Neuschwanstein Castle worth the trip, or are there better, less popular options that are easier to get to?

Also, when booking hotels: we are trying to find rooms with two twin beds versus a single double bed so we have some separation. We are not finding so many options. Are most of the double beds (which appear to be two twin beds pushed together) able to be pulled apart?

Countries with the best coffee/cafe culture?,"Which countries have you been where the locals live and breathe coffee? 

I'm talking about good coffee **and** good cafe culture

The top 3 that come to mind are:

**Vietnam** - Seems like every 2 shops is a cafe. People drink it in the morning, afternoon and night. It's very common to see the whole family hang out at night sipping on a vietnamese coffee while people watching on the sidewalk. The newer cafes have really good decor and ambience.

**Melbourne** - Very rare to get a bad coffee. I would argue that if the cafe serves bad coffee, then they will go out of business. Even the coffee at McDonalds is good. 

**Italy** - Very common to see locals standing at these expresso bars at stations and cafes just sipping on 1euro expressos. They are sooooo good and love the old school look at some of these cafes.

Honourable mentions: Peru (consistently good everywhere), Colombia (especially the towns) and Kona in Hawaii. These places have really good coffee although I don't think the cafe culture is that strong.

I'm curious as to what you guys think, I would like to add to my travel list!

If you've been to the city or are from there, about how many days would you say you'd need to visit and leave feeling satisfied?

I'm mostly interested in the historical side of things: historic architecture, history and/or historic art (i.e. non-contemporary art) museums, etc. Oh, and since this is Vienna after all, I'd be a fool not to sample the cafe culture. But food and restaurants are in general not a huge priority, it is definitely not a must to be eating at all the best places and trying every single thing Vienna has to offer.

Prague and Vienna July 2025,"Hello! I posted my original itinerary a month ago and have done some revising, as I was told it was too busy. I will be travelling with my husband and (almost) 5 year old to Prague and Vienna in July. We decided to simplify the trip with only two major destinations. I have a couple questions, however:

1. How many days in each city? Right now I'm thinking 4 in Prague, 5 in Vienna. We would be flying into Prague with an 11:30 arrival. We were planning on taking a train to Vienna, so I guess that would take a good chunk of time on the day we arrive. Is this a good division of times between the two cities?

2. Can I do this trip without a car seat or booster seat? Is it feasible to just use public transit with child and all the luggage in tow?

3. We didn't want to bring a stroller. Is this crazy of us?

As far as budget, I'm not too picky about accommodations, as long as they are clean. Although I'm guessing one city might be cheaper than the other? That could be a factor for which I would choose. Another consideration is which city is more ""unique"" and will have things that I wouldn't already see in Prague, Vienna, or Budapest?

Copenhagen/Stockholm vs Berlin/Prague/Vienna in mid-September?," Hi all,

My BF and I (both mid-20s, from USA) want to go to Europe sometime in mid-September and need advice on what’s better suited for us based on our interests.

We were thinking a 10-14 days to either:

* Copenhagen > Malmo > Stockholm
* Berlin > Prague > Vienna

I’m doing research on both trips and am a bit conflicted on which is better suited for us.

We’re not big on night life (not big drinkers), so we're more of early risers. We love great food and would try fine dining, coffee shop, pastries, architecture, nature. We’re not big on museums, but I wouldn’t mind visiting 1 or 2 museums. We do however love walking around and visiting major landmarks while enjoying the city.

We are definitely more chill people and are okay with wandering around or staying an hour or two in a coffee shop relaxing. 

I’m leaning towards Copenhagen/Stockholm because it seems less busy and relaxing and we can maybe take more day trips, but Berlin/Prague/Vienna seem to have so much to offer that I feel like I would be missing so much (especially since Vienna and Prague seem to have much more interesting architecture, although Berlin is more so about the museums).

Does anyone have any thoughts about which trip they think would be better for us? Or just general facts that I'm overlooking? Also interested in your experiences if you've been to any of the cities I mentioned!

* December 22 - morning train ride to munich (stay there for a night to see the christmas market)
* December 23 (Morning or noon) - Leave back to vienna (it may change) still thinking about heading to budapest.

Question: Upon checking on the website for train tickets its seems like they don't operate during december? Specifically with the dates above mentioned.

We are from Canada, so leaving during december is already cold and frigid in Canada, we'd like to know how is the weather in Vienna and Munich (Possible, Budapest)

* How cool/worth visiting is Hundertwasser House & Village? It looks really quirky and delightful, but with only 2 days is it worth prioritizing?

Questions about going to Hallstatt and Obertraun from Vienna,"Hey guys,

I’d like to ask a couple of questions regarding visiting Obertraun and Hallstatt. I’ll be taking the direct train from Wien Westbahnhof that departs on 8:45 to Obertraun, according to OBB this one is a direct train but when I was doing my research it seems that everybody was saying that there are no direct trains from Vienna to Obertraun so I’m just going to ask a silly question about whether this train is indeed a direct one?

Also, we are going to be a group and one of us has a big phobia from water so we are planning to take the bus from Obertraun to Hallstatt instead of the ferry, unfortunately according to Google Maps the bus stations in Obertraun are “permanently closed” so I’m wondering whether the buses from Obertraun to Hallstatt are still going?

Tue AM: Prague > Vienna

Tue PM/Weds/Thu: Vienna + Bratislava half-day trip

Thu evening: Vienna > Budapest

Fri/Sat/Sun AM: Budapest

Sun PM: Budapest > Heathrow

Bavaria or Vienna over New Years? ,"Hi guys, me and my parents are trying to decide where to go on a short break over New Years/the first week of January and have narrowed it down to a week in Vienna, or 8/9 days around Southern Bavaria (probably flying into Innsbruck or Munich).

[Solo Trip] Should I Visit Tbilisi/Budapest/Vienna or Just Budapest/Vienna,"Hey everyone, 

I have two weeks off in early/mid October, and I'm not quite sure where to go. 

I visited Scandinavia with my friends about a month ago, and it was about as expensive as I thought it was going to be haha (I'm not laughing on the inside). 

I figured I should go somewhere cheaper this time. I know Austria is not going to be cheap, but it was never part of my original plan. I only recently realized how easy it is to get from Budapest and Vienna! 

Anyway, if I do the first option, I would stay in Tbilisi for exactly one week and then fly to Budapest with exactly one week of vacation left. I would spend the majority of my time in Budapest and spend a full day--and maybe one night--in Vienna and then go back to Budapest. Or I might spend the last day and night in Vienna and fly back home from there instead. 

If I do the second option, I would spend one week in Budapest and most of the second week in Vienna while also visiting Innsbruck for a day and a night.

Tbilisi/Budapest/Vienna would be awesome. It would be a more diverse trip, and I would get to visit three countries instead of just two. Budapest/Vienna and maybe Innsbruck would be great too but a little less diverse.

New Year's trip to Vienna,"Hi, me and my friends (7 people in total) have decided to go to Vienna for the new year (December 30, 2024-January 3, 2025). We planned to visit some of the famous places like the zoo, Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien or Museum of Natural History Vienna, one of the palaces, explore the city etc... I am interested in your advice on what else to visit, where to eat, some good clubs etc. I would like to know if the museums are open on 31.12. or 1.1., since I assume that the shops are not working or am I wrong? Where to spend New Year's Eve (club or square?), can alcohol be consumed on the streets during that night? Any good restaurants, Austrian home cooking? I read that you can buy a 3-day public transport ticket, it includes all types of transport like trams, buses, metro...? Is it worth spending almost the whole day at the zoo and is it open during New Year's days? We plan to go by car and leave it in one of the Park+Ride garages, is it true that parking there costs approx. 5e/day and is it safe to leave the car there?

I know this is a lot of questions and I will be grateful if I get an answer to at least some of them, also I will gladly accept and consider any advice :D

Final hours of my 16 months around the world trip,"**TLDR:** Made redundant at the end of 2022, didn't want to find another job. Packed up and travelled the world.

**update** done for now, flight soon, thanks for the questions. 

**update 2** ok really done now, boarding.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down. That coupled with the fact that we were cooped up after some of the most longest and strictest lockdowns it was time to get out and see the world.

The objective of the travels was essentially to explore and ""live"", as you will see most of the places we stayed were capital Cities. We ended up doing ALOT of day trips from the major capitals either by train or tour company. Most of the time it was much cheaper just to do a full day tour than to actually hire a car for the day.

Most of the places we stayed were booked through either [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Airbnb (booking.com was a much cheaper option most of the time)

Weird experience with Vienna border,"I went to visit a friend during Christmas season in 2023 and had a weird experience at the Vienna border coming from a flight from London.

The border police was incredibly rude and I’ve just never been faced with such a hostile interaction through my travels in Europe. The border police first asked questions like why are you here, how many days. I answered each one professionally and presented all of my bookings and train tickets out of Vienna in a couple days. He looked very suspicious and kept on saying: you are not going to stay more than this number of days right? I said no of course not, as you can see, I am going to visit Prague after my trip and I already booked my train tickets and my hotel in Prague. He kept on looking at my passport, bookings and me back and forth for like another 3 minutes with a whole line of people behind me wondering what was wrong. He then said: you cannot stay more than 4 days(the number of days I mentioned I was staying) and I said yes I understand.

Tips for my itinerary in Vienna next february?,"Hey guys, I made a 4-day itinerary in Wien for my upcoming trip there next month, I'll be staying in 7th district, Neubau.

I'm a huge fan of the Before Sunrise movie, so there will be some sites I'll try to visit because of it, like Zollamtssteg, Café Sperl or Kleines Café, Donaukanal etc.

The places in blue are a must for me, the other ones I wouldn't be so hurt to remove them if necessary. I really want to do it at a slow pace, enjoy the coffee and people watching culture with time. Most of my lunch and dinner will be street food so I can save time and especially money, but coffee in the afternoon I really want to take my time and enjoy the experience :)

1.  im wondering whether it is worth going back to the Belvedere in the afternoon (I have to purchase another ticket again) or whether to spend most of my time at the Kunsthistorisches, where there are several works of art I want to see.

  
2.  Is the Albertina worthwhile?  I would love to see Durer’s The Hare in person, but I don’t know if the rest of the museum is worth the price

Bratislava/Vienna itinerary over New Years? ,"I’m flying out to Vienna with my parents on the 27th (but in the afternoon so no real time for sightseeing) and flying back on the 3rd (but pretty early so that day also basically doesn’t count lol) , and our current plan is to get a bus directly from the airport to Bratislava, stay there for 3 nights, then travel to Vienna fairly early on the 30th and have 4 nights there, including over NYE and NYD.

This would give us a solid 2 days in Bratislava and 3.5 days in Vienna, does that seem fair?? There’s SO MANY museums/art galleries we want to see in Vienna and I know we have to factor in things being closed on NYD. I think the Jewish Museum and Schönnbrunn are open though and we’ve booked a concert on that day, not sure about anything else? 

I’m aware Bratislava could be done as a day trip from Vienna lol, but we’re basically just trying to save a little bit of money by staying there because the difference in airbnb prices is mind boggling!! 

Also, I would be very grateful for any recommendations for places to go on NYE/nightlife in general, my parents are definitely too old for clubs/anything too wild but we’d all enjoy a pub or jazz bars etc etc

"First Time In Vienna, few questions ","Hi Everyone,   
My mother(67) and I(40) are flying from Canada to India and doing a stopover in Vienna for 4 full days. We arrive Friday afternoon and depart Tuesday evening, I have a couple of questions -   
  
A) Is there any reasonable luggage storage at Vienna Airport? From what i saw online it seems like the only option is €10.00per bag per day,  which is quite expensive considering we have 4 bags, which would work out to €40 per day X 5 days. 

B) Should we take the train from the airport or take a taxi or uber? What is the best way to get into the city?  

C) Where do you recommend we should stay? Considering my mother is older and cannot really walk a whole lot and might have to rest or take ubers. 

D) Mostly importantly, I am considering since we have 4 full days and 2 half days, should we consider doing an overnight trip to Salzburg? How convenient is it to get in and out of there? Secondly should we take the train or should i rent a car at the airport/in the city? How convenient is driving around Austria? Ideally i would prefer not to deal with a car rental but if it is recommended and easy, definitely something i will consider. 

Any other general advice is much appreciated including sights to see, where to stay, eat etc.

2 weeks in vienna and budapest,"Hi, would love some opinions/help with this! I am planning my first solo trip to Europe and I’m thinking of going for two weeks, first to Vienna and then to Budapest. Flights are around $980 CAD round trip in February if I fly back home from Vienna (instead of Budapest in which case it would be about $1500). I plan on taking the high speed train between the two cities, which I believe would take about 2.5 hours and cost about $50 CAD each way. Would it be better to just fly out of the city I end up in and accept the higher price?

For background, I have traveled on my own before within Canada and the US, and have gone with a group to Mexico, so I have traveled lots, though never overseas. The reason I am considering February is because I am unexpectedly in between jobs (otherwise would plan further in advance). The reason I am considering these two cities is because the flights/accommodations/food are more affordable than say Paris and London even in off season.

How would you split up a week trip to Vienna/Bratislava/Budapest?,"Hiya, Im turning 18 soon enough and am looking to book my first trip for late August/early Sept, for a mix of financial reasons and personal interest in the area, Im 95% sure Ill be going around the places mentioned in the title

That being said, Ill be flying in to Vienna, and leaving from Budapest a week later. Im left with the question of how long Ill spend in each city. 

I've heard good things about Vienna and Budapest both, while the consensus from friends Ive heard if that Bratislava is worth around a days trip, so I've thought either go
 3d Vienna, 1d Bratislava, 3d budapest or 
2d Vienna, 1d Bratislava, 4d Budapest with a day dedicated to Lake Balaton

The reasoning for my somewhat bias to Budapest is the fact I have 2 friends I want to meet there and admittedly the fact its cheaper with regards to food and such

Hence I suppose my questions boil down to a) how long is worth dedicating to Vienna b) if Bratislava is worth more than a single day c) if Lake Balaton is worth the bother at all

Of course willing to listen to anything else to consider for this trip, but those are my main questions

Does this itinerary seem reasonable? Austria in February- Tirol-Vienna; Any feedback welcome on anything,"Hello! 

I am planning a trip to Austria this February. I tend to be quite effusive and to ramble, so I will try to keep this as much to the point as possible for readability (the “considerations” section at the end is additional but not necessary context, so feel free to skip that). I appreciate any feedback or insights you may have! I have been to a few places, but find trip-planning very difficult once one veers outside cities. Thank you so much for any help or time you may be able to provide.



Relevant context: 

\-I will be based in Strasbourg, France, so that is where I will be coming from and returning to.

\-I have been to Munich and Salzburg already and plan to do a broader tour of Bavaria (and to visit Budapest) in the spring/early summer

\-I am attending a ball in Vienna, so everything sort of revolves around that

\-I do not have the biggest budget. The trip itself is a huge splurge that I’ve been saving for (especially considering the ball and winter sports), so I will not be able to do expensive meals regularly or any expensive tours unless it’s something that is extremely worth it/once-in-a-lifetime chance. I will be staying in budget accommodations like hostels, perhaps moving to a hotel a day before the ball to have more privacy as we get ready for it. 

\-I will be traveling solo until Vienna, where my date for the ball should be joining me. 

\-I will be depending on public transportation. 

\-I speak English and French, but am only at Duolingo-level German so far. I hope to take a German language class in Strasbourg, but will still only be at a beginner level.



Strasbourg-Tirol-Vienna-Strasbourg 

Saturday, February 8 (this could potentially be a travel day instead of a prep day): Make sure everything is prepared for trip (pack and get haircut for ball if haven’t already)

Sunday, February 9: Take 5-ish hour train to Munich- stop in Munich for a bite? 

			Then, 3-ish hour train to Seefeld. 

Monday, February 10: Get rentals, do nordic skiing lesson, and ski the day

Tuesday, February 11: Winter excursion(s), perhaps a hike/toboggan, explore the area.

\----------

A few considerations if it helps: 

\-I am not sure how packing will work out as I need to bring things for both a winter trip as well as a city trip. So, I will probably have more luggage than just a backpack- if you have any insight on things I should consider regarding this, I would really appreciate it. Fortunately, I will be renting a tux for the ball, so I don’t need to worry about that other than footwear. 

\-I got super overwhelmed researching winter activities and regions in Austria as there is no lack of opportunities. I have picked Seefeld for now as I just have to move forward with a plan and solidify accommodations asap. I can alpine ski (would do mostly blues, I loved Les Arcs in France), and have gone nordic skiing only one time- I would like to take a lesson or two while there and do a bit more of this on this trip as opposed to downhill, as well as winter hiking. I am looking for experiencing scenery over sportive/competitive-ness. I love the idea of skiing or hiking from hut to hut and am trying to make that a reality. It seems Seefeld has a lot of options, is scenic, and accessible via public transportation. I am still quite active but not in the best of shape right now due to a couple of injuries that prevented regular exercise over the summer, so I have de-emphasized alpine skiing. Being a novice to nordic skiing, however, I tried to pace the skiing out as opposed to doing it everyday, which I did just fine in Les Arcs a couple years ago. 

\-I love trying regional cuisines and am very interested in regional beer/wine/spirits culture and history (no dietary restrictions). I also love music and traditional folk culture (I am an amateur classical and folk musician). I try to immerse myself as much as I can and to feel like I’m a part of things when traveling, to find tradition. I am still barely under 30, but am starting to feel my body get older and want to start learning how to plan and take advantage of any excursions in nature as I can. I have no experience in this, but I am good at walking and am regularly active.

Hotel prices are crazy now,"Hey, is it me or hotel/hostels prices have gone up significantly in recent years especially in Europe and North America? I understand that everything is more expensive now, but for christ sake how can people go to Rome now without being crazy rich?

I have enough money to travel, but some country are now completly off my list for now for this reason. I can't seem to find anything in Barcelona, Rome or Berlin that's not north of 200$ for a terrible sketchy room. 

Even hostels now are crazy expensive for a single room.  I don't care about dorms, i'm not 18 anymore and I travel with my SO, 50-70 bucks for a dorm is nonsense still.

It's sad for young people. I was able to afford backpacking in Europe 10 years ago when I was 18, it seems it's impossible nowadays without couchsurfing.

Btw I usually look prices on Booking and Hostelworlds.

Edit : I understand there's plenty of good deals at the moment, it certainly wasn't the case a couple of months ago. Lets say I'm speaking for prices between may and September. I understand that it's the high season but still, I was able to find places in may/june before and september is not THAT busy usually.",729,412,1701196232.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1862zg0/hotel_prices_are_crazy_now/,Available-Ad-4484
"Rome, Prague, Vienna, Paris and Amsterdam itinerary suggestions?","Me and my wife are planning a trip to Europe for later this year and I’m researching a lot on Reddit, but have read many conflicting things, it’s getting confusing on some parts.

Currently I am planning to visit: Rome (5 nights), Vienna (2 nights), Prague (3 nights), Paris (4 nights) and Amsterdam (2 nights)

Some say I should lessen the days from Rome and Paris but those cities being so big, any lesser days does not make sense to me. 

I’m also not sure if we’ll like Vienna, so many people on here say they don’t like Vienna, maybe we should add Budapest instead? 

We went to a trip to Istanbul last year and really liked spending time on the Istiklal street with those small alleys and restaurants and trying different food, clubs etc. So we are looking for similar experiences. We’re not much into museums but experiences, beauty of the city and just general sightseeing.

I would really appreciate any feedback you have. Total trip days are 18 days. Any place we should add, any we should remove any other changes we should do? Please, we would really appreciate your inputs. ",1,17,1714760005.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cjffq0/rome_prague_vienna_paris_and_amsterdam_itinerary/,SayedHasmi

Vienna+Budapest Trip,"Hi everyone,

Partner and I are going to both cities on a trip from Jan 8th until Jan 17th. With travel, we have about 8 full days in the area. 

We were wondering how to split this time—does each city deserve an equal split of 4 days? 

Also super open to any reccs for food, sightseeing, or hotels. We think we found a great place in Vienna, but have run into some bad luck in Budapest—found quite a few nice hotels with bad reviews for cleanliness. We were thinking of doing Casati for Budapest, as it seemed like a great option within our budget (about $120/night max). For Vienna, we’re pretty set on NH, but are still open to other ideas.

Flight with layover (Sarajevo - Vienna - NY),"I am flying with Austrian Airlines from Sarajevo to New York with a layover in Vienna (1 hour). Both flights are on the same reservation. From Vienna to New York, I will also be flying with Austrian Airlines (just a different type of plane i guess).

How does it work with luggage? Do I need to collect my luggage in Vienna and check it in again?

I have a bag up to 23kg and a backpack. Could someone please explain the whole process,from check in, boarding the plane to the layover and then to the final destination? Thank you.

"Any places that are great to visit DESPITE the food? Any places you visited that were awful, but the food alone made it worthwhile?","Somewhat inspired by the recent question about places that you wanted to enjoy hard, but couldn't: 

I wanted to have a good time in Budapest, but just couldn't. It wasn't bad in any sense, but having been to e.g. Vienna, Prague, and a bunch of other cities in the region it just didn't stand out that much. BUT: one thing that really hit home though was the food - anything from the more stereotypically traditional Hungarian dishes and the wine, to ""new Hungarian"" cuisine and the dozens of ways to cook  catfish from Lake Balaton.

2) Conversely, many parts of upper/mountainous Central Asia, e.g. the High Pamirs in Tajikistan/Kyrgyzstan, the Wakhan Corridor bordering Afghanistan etc. were some of the most beautiful places that I have ever been to in my life, with only few other places on our planet coming close in my opinion. Despite the gorgeous scenery and the incredible hospitality of the local populations however the food has been awful. Of course, these are remote regions with limited agriculture and wide-spread poverty, but even in some of the more fertile and accessible parts of e.g. Tajikistan you'd be lucky to find more than the same 2-4 dishes done more or less well.

Any place in particular that stood out to you on either side of the scale? Any place that would make it worthwhile to visit just for the food alone, versus places that are so magnificent that even a foodie would enjoy them in spite of the lack of good food options?

Honeymoon to Prague/Vienna/Budapest - seeking advice on Vienna leg,"Hi everyone! My husband (39M) and myself (35F) have planned our honeymoon to Central Europe (flying in to Prague, flying out of Budapest) from 6 to 19 December and I was wondering if anyone had any advice. As some context, we are based in Malaysia and this will be the longest time either of us has spent in Europe, so super excited! (Husband has spent time in Munich and Wattens in Austria for work and I have only spent half a day in London on a layover). We both love the cold weather, and enjoy sightseeing, history and sampling tons of local food. Husband also enjoys driving, so we usually rent a car for some part of our holidays so he can experience driving on local roads.

So far, our plan is to spend 4 nights these cities to give ourselves enough time to enjoy each place instead of rushing from place to place:

· Prague – Arrive on the 6th in the early morning, leave on the 10th

· Vienna – Arrive 10th and leave on the 14th

· Budapest – Arrive 14th and leave on 18th (early morning)

However, I’ve been toying with the idea of heading out of Vienna to see some of the beautiful landscapes and also to mix it up instead of just experiencing big cities and architecture for two weeks. So far, I’ve considered these options

1. Day trip to Hallstatt (I don’t think I’d like to lug bags all the way there and looks like a day trip is enough)

2. Stay in a nice lakeside resort in Zell am See for one or two nights of the Vienna leg; if we have time, then to make a stop at Hallstatt on the way there

I’m thinking for either of those options we will rent a car and make a road trip out of it. I’m aware many consider these two places very touristy, so happy to hear any alternatives too.

"Help Needed: Fitting Vienna into a 15-Day Europe Trip Itinerary (Barcelona, Budapest, Munich, Milan)","Hello everyone. My wife and I (both 40 years old) are going on a 15-day trip to Europe. We are from Brazil. 

I have already bought my ticket to Barcelona and my return ticket from Milan. We will be traveling on August 8th and leaving on August 22nd. 

My schedule so far is: I arrive at 6:00 PM in Barcelona on the 8th. I plan to stay in Barcelona on the 9th, 10th, and 11th. On the 12th, I will go to Budapest and stay there on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th. Then I will take a train to Munich (16th-17th-18th). On the 19th, I will take a bus or train to Milan, where I will stay on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, and leave at 8:00 PM on the 22nd. During the 3 days I will stay in Milan: 1 day is a day trip to Lake Como, Bellagio, and Lugano, another day is for Modena and Bologna, and just one day for Milan itself.

To summarize: 4 nights in Barcelona, 4 nights in Budapest, 3 nights in Munich, and 3 nights in Milan. However, I would like to fit Vienna into my itinerary between Budapest and Munich. How would you change my schedule to fit Vienna in? Is just one full day in Vienna enough to visit at least the main tourist attractions? (I know each city can take weeks to be fully explored, but last year I spent 24 full hours in Brussels, and I believe I enjoyed and saw at least the main points, and I was satisfied with that). Would you reduce my time in Barcelona, Budapest, or Munich to do this?

I went to Zagreb several years ago and one of the most memorable things about it was the offbeat museums dotted around-- Museum of Broken Relationships and Museum of Torture were among the most interesting. I know of the Puppet Museum in Prague (I looked at their residencies before) but I was wondering if there were any other random little unconventional places dotted around either city that I could potter around for an hour or so. (Or, also, feel free to recommend some of the bigger museums like the Klimt one in Vienna if they're worth checking out!)",1,19,1706565450.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ae7giz/weird_museums_in_prague_or_vienna/,golgothaterrors
Classical concert in Vienna? ,Hi all! I'm going to Vienna alone at the start of September and just wondered where the best places are to see classical music that won't break the bank? St Peter's looks like a pretty venue and tickets are only £30 but not sure if this is a tourist trap? I don't really listen to classical music at all so anything I see will likely sound good to me! any advice/info is appreciated :) ,3,7,1721077739.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e46aub/classical_concert_in_vienna/,anon38713
Vienna first time visit + café recommendations ,"Hey everyone! My husband and I are visiting Vienna for the first time in late October, just for a couple of days. 

We are looking for recommendations - apart from the obvious/Google recommended places, but specially good cafés or small restaurants to visit, that are normally not on the organic search results. 

We don’t party or drink, and we are interested in cultural stuff and photo spots.

We are staying close to the Vienne-Midi Station as it seems to be the best area for a quick ride to the airport.

Traveling to Vienna via Budapest,"I'm traveling to Vienna from Israel in August for a Taylor Swift concert.

Is there anything I'm overlooking that would be a problem with this plan? I'm not a very experienced traveler and I'm looking for some reassurance that this isn't a stupid idea.",7,13,1713336496.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1c636n9/traveling_to_vienna_via_budapest/,sarah_peas
What travel destination most exceeded your expectations?,"I enjoyed reading comments on the “most [meh](https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10azq5t/what_is_the_most_meh_countrytrip_you_have_ever/) destination” thread.

I’d love to hear about destinations you had low expectations for, that grossly exceeded them. 

Mine was Ottawa. 

We ended up there on a trip with extended family.  I’d heard mostly negative things about it: it was sleepy, boring and not particularly worth visiting.  

I really enjoyed it. The canals and walkways were beautiful in June. People were cruising around on boats having a good time. We felt totally safe walking around at night.  Good cycling infrastructure with beautiful scenery.  I enjoyed our tour of Parliament and a few other buildings.  Stayed in a nice historic hotel for a very affordable rate. And while it wasn’t a foodie destination in the same way that other cities might be, we ate some great meals there.

Suggestions for Munich and Vienna in December?,"Hello, I’m thinking of traveling to Europe in early December. Right now I am looking at Munich and Vienna as possible locations. The focus of the trip will be checking out the Christmas Markets, but I was just wondering is there still a lot to do other than that? Maybe museums you can recommend? 

I’m just wondering if tours and other activities will be limited due to the weather. I’m from a warmer climate so I’m not really sure what to expect or what to plan. Like are outdoor food markets and flea markets still open during the colder season? 

I’ve tried looking at guides and videos on YouTube but the bulk of them focus on the summer months and Christmas Markets. 

So if you have any suggestions let me know!

Mostly looking for ideas on outdoor things, short hikes, biking, things like that. 

Only things set in stone is flying in and out of Munich and some castle in Vienna that my wife has to visit. Other than that we are pretty flexible.  We will be renting a car to get around.

Berlin/Prague/Vienna/Budapest,"Hi everyone -

My husband and I are planning a two week trip in late spring. It seems as though airfare is cheapest to fly in and out of Berlin so that’s the tentative plan. 

We were thinking of spending four days in Berlin, three days in Prague, three days in Vienna, and three days in Budapest. Is this cramming too much in one trip though? 

When on vacation we really enjoy driving and exploring the countryside. Also enjoy hiking, museums, World War II, history, museums, castles. Not so big on nightlife, but do enjoy good meals as most people do. 

Are we crazy to want to drive the entire trip? Often we plan our trips in a loop so that we’re not seeing the same sites both ways. This trip does not lend itself to that as much. Should we eliminate one of these cities? I feel like this trip would be much more doable with an open jaw flight. But those are much more expensive and there would be the additional expense of renting a car in one location and dropping it off in another.

Advice greatly appreciated!",2,23,1697826667.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17ci25a/berlinpragueviennabudapest/,lefty709

Tips for navigating Vienna?,"I'm going to Vienna in a few weeks, and I have never been to Austria before. Not really looking for tips on things to do, as I can find that myself (although if you *are* dying to recommend something, go for it). But I'm a little nervous navigating a new city (not such a seasoned traveler), so I'm wondering if anyone has any practical tips?

- In particular, how is the public transport? What is the best way to get around (bus/train/tram)? And how do you buy tickets (app/on the bus/in a shop)? Can you get a day pass, and will this be valid on all services?

- How is the English fluency of people in Vienna? Do they mind switching over for tourists? And if I learn a few German phrases, will they understand it with ease, or is Austrian German any different? 

- Can I use a debit card everywhere or is it best to have cash? 

- Any other advice? I will be going for four days, and will probably only or mainly be in the city centre. ",1,4,1722331980.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1efp2d1/tips_for_navigating_vienna/,allthebeautifultimes

Vienna > Prague > Berlin Distribution,"Hi all,

I made a previous post about which Europe trip I should take in September and this community was such a huuuuge help!

|Day 1|7AM Land in Vienna|

|Day 2|Vienna||
|Day 3|Vienna||
|Day 4|Vienna (Day trip to Bratislava)||
|Day 5|Vienna||
|Day 6|Vienna > Prague||

|Day 8|Prague||
|Day 9|Prague||
|Day 10|Prague > Dresden > Berlin|Leave Prague early, spend the day in Dresden, leave for Berlin in the evening|
|Day 11|Berlin||
|Day 12|Berlin||
|Day 13|Berlin||
|**Day 14**|7AM Fly back to Vienna to catch 11AM Flight home||



* 5 nights in Vienna (1 day trip)
* 4 nights in Prague
* 1 day in Dresden (in between)
* 4 nights in Berlin

I originally wanted to spend more time (the most time) in Prague because it's the cheapest in terms of hotels and the plan was to spend like 6 days in Prague and have 2 day trips (Dresden and maybe Cesky Krumlov), but visiting Dresden in between Prague and Berlin seems to make more sense.
