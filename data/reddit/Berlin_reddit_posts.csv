What once-popular tourist destinations are now largely forgotten or abandoned?,"# 

I'm curious about places that were major tourism hotspots in the past but have since fallen into obscurity or been largely abandoned.

Some examples that come to mind:

* **Bodie, California**: Once a booming gold rush town with 10,000 residents and countless visitors, now a preserved ghost town state park
* **Varosha, Cyprus**: Former Mediterranean resort that attracted celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor in the 1960s before becoming a ghost town after the 1974 Turkish invasion
* **Belle Isle Amusement Park in Detroit**: Early 20th century premier destination with 50,000+ daily summer visitors before closing in 1982
* **Hashima Island (Gunkanjima), Japan**: Industrial tourism site with record population density in the 1950s, abandoned in 1974 when coal mining ceased
* **Spreepark, Berlin**: East Germany's only amusement park that attracted 1.7 million visitors annually before closing in 2001

What other places have you encountered that were once overrun with tourists but are now largely forgotten? What caused their decline - geopolitical changes, economic shifts, environmental disasters, changing travel preferences?

Also curious if you think any of today's over-touristed destinations might experience a similar fate in the future! Maybe Lisbon or Barcelona?",2165,1101,1745790939.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k9fmq3/what_oncepopular_tourist_destinations_are_now/,FrozenOppressor

"Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Vienna, or Zurich","I am planning a trip for April 2026 of approximately 2 weeks in length. I currently have an itinerary of Rome-Barcelona. On a previous trip to Europe we visited Prague (liked), Paris (didn’t like), Florence (liked), Rome (liked).  I have previously been to Copenhagen as well, which I enjoyed. My SO spent quite a bit of time in Switzerland 30+ years ago, but I’ve not been.

We talked about going back to Rome someday, hence the current itinerary. However, this is going to be only our second trip to Europe as a couple (first trip was >10 years ago) and we don’t get to travel to Europe very often. We also have a friend in London that we’d like to visit so I am considering replacing Rome with another city to see other parts of Europe and adding London, and would like some advice on which city to possibly substitute.

About us:
- We prefer not to move hotels too often, so we want to be in a city 3-5 full days and move at a more relaxed pace
- we like food, culture, and museums (art and national history, not the more niche ones like spy museums etc). A museum visit will likely take most of our day unless it’s really small
- walking yes biking no
- Hyatt globalist and Marriott Platinum, but could really use the nights for Hyatt so that would be my strong preference 

I am building an alternate itinerary to bring up with my SO. Between Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Vienna, and Zurich, which one should I add to London and Barcelona, and what makes you say that?

Trying to decide between Berlin and Copenhagen? Solo traveler 35F,"Hi all! I’ve been trying to search on Reddit which area would fit me better but can’t find quite the information I need.

I traveled solo to Amsterdam this year and my favorite thing about it was able to walk anywhere in the city and be able to take the train/bus to the beach, national parks, basically anywhere in The Netherlands. Exploring the country was so incredible.

So, I’m leaning towards Berlin but I would also like public transit access to nature/bodies of water and it seems like Copenhagen would be better for that? I also would love recs for other places in Europe where I can have a mix of city and nature facilitated by public transit.

Will we realistically be able to cover all of these sights in Berlin?,"My wife and I are going on our honeymoon and are first time cruisers. One of the excursions is from the coast (Warnemunde) to Berlin. The excursion description says the train takes 3 hours to get there, and we'd be leaving at 8am. This likely puts us in the city at 11/11:30ish. There is no exact time it says to be back at the train station, but the total time of the excursion says 12 hours, so assuming it also takes 3 hours to get back to the Warnemunde port, I'd assume we'd leave at 5pm. That leaves 5 to 6 hours to explore. Can we feasibly see all of these things if I get a public transit day pass using the BVG Fahrinfo app:

\* Brandenburg Gate  
\* The WWII Memorial (right next to the Brandenburg Gate)  
\* Reichstag Dome (We applied for tickets at the 12:30 time slot)  
\* The Siegessaule  
\* Cafe am Neuer See Biergarten  
\* Checkpoint Charlie  
\* Berliner Dom  
\* Museum Island (if we don't actually go into the museums - just walking around the island)  
\* Berliner Fernsehturm (also not planning to go to the top - unless there's time)  
\* Alexanderplatz World Clock   
\* East Side Gallery

How do I take this bucket list trip?,"I have stage 4 cancer.  I'm not dying yet, but the treatment I was on stopped working, and now I am trying other treatments.

Having said all that, my family and I (husband, and 3 kids -9,10,17), may not get a lot more time to travel all the places we wanted to see before I'm gone.

I have never been to Europe, and I've always dreamed of visiting London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome (or Venice or Tuscany), and eating my way through the continent!

I am wondering if there is a way to visit all those places with 5 people in 2-3 weeks.

Train?  River Cruise?  What's the best way to get around?  Is there a way to get help planning this kind of trip?  Places to eat? Basically everything?

We are looking at a budget of $35,000 ($6k per person).

Edit:  to answer a few questions

- I am from the US (Denver, CO).

- The soonest we'd want to go is probably the fall.  My kids get a week off in October.  But if we should try and do next summer, that would give us even more time to plan.

Edit 2:  you guys are so amazing!  You've given me the confidence to know we CAN make this trip, even if the thought of planning it is quite overwhelming!

I'm the kind of person who usually does all inclusive because I don't like to have to figure out every detail!  

I'll likely take the suggestion of many of you to reach out to a travel agent and see what they suggest.  Seems to be the smart move!

Edit:  I got more messages and comments overnight than I have ever gotten before!  Thank you all.  It will take me a while to sift through.  But this is why I love Reddit!  When someone needs help, you all show up!

Edit:  a lot of you have been saying to take the trip sooner.  Unfortunately, I'm currently getting chemo every 3 weeks until the end of April, which means I feel pretty crappy 2 weeks out of the month.

So I can't plan the trip until I know how I'm going to feel when my chemo is done.

I really want to hold out until October so it won't be so hot, and I'll know where I'm at as far as how I'm feeling.

I know it's a risk that I won't be well enough.  If things get to that point, I'll probably cash in my 401k and just go!",1231,247,1739747507.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ir5gno/how_do_i_take_this_bucket_list_trip/,smartypants333

I also climbed the pyramids, and got a piece of the Berlin Wall as a souvenir. I'm not sure if these are frowned upon now.

Should I stay longer in Berlin or go to Dresden?,"Hi all, I'll be in Berlin from May 18-30 for a Maymester. I will then be making my way to Vienna for a summer semester. I'm planning on stopping by Prague and Cesky Krumlov (it's 10 days between Berlin and Vienna). My question is, before I head to Prague, should I stay in Berlin or go to Dresden?

My question is, should I stay in Berlin (May 31-June 3) or go to Dresden?

Looking at budgeting/pricing, they both seem to be about the same price in terms of hotels (at least the ones I'm looking at) and public transport.

I've waited my entire life for this - please advise,"Hi all!  I'm 40, a single father, my son joined the Army making me an empty nester.  I resigned from my job a couple of months ago, and I am 30-45 days away from being able to cut away and disappear for a while.

I plan to not have much of a plan - I want to take a suitcase, my golf clubs and a passport and just... go for a while.  I've budgeted $100k for a year of travel and intend to see the world until I get bored or run out of money, whichever comes first.

I have never taken a true vacation before; the reality of what I'm about to do (and my lack of experience) is settling on me. What am I not thinking of that could make this go poorly? What \*should\* be planned? Is bringing my golf clubs dumb?

In my brain I envision something like this:  Go to SE Asia first, Vietnam and Thailand I'd like to visit.  I don't know how long I'll stay, but I'm confident I can find a place to stay that's decent and stretches my budget. From there, I really want to learn how to scuba dive in New Zealand and see Poor Knights(edit).  I've never been to Europe so if after those two stops I'm still hungry for more I figure I'll just start in Portugal and work my way up to Berlin for what I hear is a great place to go dancing.

I'm not married to any ideas. I love EDM, I want to go dance and see the world and have fun for a while with no responsibilities or obligations - meet new people, figure out who the hell I am, y'know that kind of stuff.

I've fantasized about this moment for a very long time. I am equally excited and terrified. If you were in my shoes, what kinds of things are you doing to ensure this year goes smoothly?

EDIT:  Golf clubs are out, I was on the fence there thanks all lol

EDIT2: Thank you everyone for the advice!  I did go to REI to try on a backpack and got overwhelmed. They put a bunch of weights in a 65+10 Osprey and it was worse than any rucksack I ever carried lol. I'm thinking a large duffel bag with backstraps is probably cool, and I'll just adapt on the fly for things I need.

Europe first vs. SEA first, I'm not sure. I'll think on this as I get my house ready for rent. Europe feels like a budget sink and that's why I wanted to leave it for last; I didn't think I would have trouble with language or culture in SEA. These are the reasons I chose SEA as the starting point (plus proximity to NZ. I visited Sydney when I was in the Army, but I owe Melbourne it's due yet)

Figure out my phone plan ahead of time (I was just gonna roam and keep my AT&T plan). 

I will definitely get my 'jabs' (new slang lfg), my passport is good for many years, I'll find some good travel insurance (never heard of or considered this, thanks all), Barcelona > Berlin for my dance vibe ;)

Thanks :)

Edit 1: I have about 4 hours left before I have to leave for my gate for boarding, I’m hanging in there! Glad I stayed in the lounge for the day. I’m super beat and I have insane travel anxiety (I think that traveling solo is just a bit too overstimulating for me) so it’s been good to relax and have some decent food.

To make matters worse, there is actually no way to get between 2nd class and 1st class cars on this train, so literally all 1st class passengers were sprinting from 1 end of the (very crowded) platform to the other end to get onto the train (also the train arrived at 14:05 with scheduled departure of 14:10 so there was real risk you could miss the train if you didn't run). I would actually suggest standing in the middle of the platform and then you can avoid this rush either way.
2. If you book this particular train online, you can request a seat reservation but you can't select the seat, or even request a window / aisle. I strongly suggest calling the reservation hotline instead to request a specific seat.
3. For 1st class specifically, on the NS website, it said very clearly that 1st class seats only have power outlets on the window. This is false, actually there are power outlets under every seat - but only the window and middle seats have access to a desk. If you are planning to do work / use your laptop (which I assume many people are doing on this nearly 6 hour train ride) then you should really try to get the window seat >> middle seat, again which requires calling the NS phone number in advance.
4. This only changed a few months ago so I can't blame the internet for being wrong, but there is no longer a dining car on this train, just a snack cart.
5. This is just personal opinion but unlike many other intercity trains, this one actually can get quite full (according to another passenger in my compartment who travels this route regularly) and people are sitting on the floor in 2nd class. Keep in mind this is April, not even peak travel season. I would say it's pretty much a necessity to book a seat reservation in 2nd class or just spring for 1st class.",9,8,1745239079.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k4cgww/small_tips_about_taking_the_train_between/,Dry_Row_7523
Berlin alternatives,"Hi everyone! I’m planning a trip for the summer with some friends.

Got 5 days to make it from Berlin to Helsinki - would appreciate some help with an itinerary,"Basically what the title says. I had a different trip line up for that week in June, but my plans fell through and now I find myself in an unusual position of having a 5 day gap between cities.

I have a strong interest in history, especially the Warsaw pact and Jewish history. I do speak fluent russian and ok Ukrainian, but realize that it's a sensitive issue in the region and plan to stick to English.

Right now looking at Krakow or Gdansk for an easy train ride from Berlin, but not seeing any straightforward connections into the Baltics.

"Six nights in Berlin; one night in Hostel, 5 nights in general hotel -autistic traveller","
L
I’m going to Berlin in the last week of June for 6 nights. I’m hoping to do possibly a day trip to Postdam as well. Just to note that I am really active and often out from 10 am to 10 pm sometimes 12 am and place emphasis on tourist destinations. I cover a lot of tourist destinations in one day. Is the length of stay too much for my hectic schedule?. I've done some research and most people spend four or five nights in Berlin.

I am trying to save money so was wondering if i can stay one night in hostel. 

It’s worth noting that I’m autistic and therefore needs to be taken into consideration and whilst I’m good at masking that doesn’t entirely absolve me from getting into conflict so I’ll probably need to pack good headphones. I have done some research.  Hostels are very cheap but without the hotels, i will be looking at £500-£600 for six nights without. 

Any recommendations for hotels would be greatly appreciated as well as places to eat and the length of stay. Appreciate that this is a duplicate post but I haven't really mentioned my autism that much.

Getting around Berlin,"I’m looking to do a short break around Berlin in April and wondering the best way to get around. It looks like there is a pretty good public transport system and I will likely do lots of walking - but I just wondered what the best ticket would be to buy regarding the A B and C zones.

From the airport, in the C zone, I will travel to my hotel, but for this do I buy one specific ticket for this journey? Or would it be cheaper to buy an ABC ticket to travel around once I’m in the city centre? 

Are there passes for a few days that you can pay for in advance? As I wouldn’t then be travelling back out into the C zone until going back to the airport? 

I’m just wondering how others have navigated this and what the best/cheapest option to get around is, or if things are generally easier to walk? (Other than the airport)

What neighborhoods/general areas to stay in Berlin,"Hello,

Tried searching around for good answers but some things are a couple years old and wanted to get some possible up to date information/advice

I will be visiting Berlin for a weekend in August and wanted to get some ideas on areas to stay. I am traveling with my partner, and it will be our first time there.

As an aside, we are interested in the following things:

* museums-art, history (would love to visit private galleries too, if that is a thing)
* general history (low hanging fruit but for example the Berlin Wall)
* coffee shops, cafes, vintage shops, good food varieties
* I noticed there are a lot of parks so we'd love to have good access to good parks

In my research online, I've found people recommending Prenzlauer Berg, Hackescher Markt, and Friedrichshain as good areas to stay at. I've also been looking at the location where the [Hotel Luc](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+Luc,+Autograph+Collection/@52.5161254,13.3868306,15.42z/data=!3m1!5s0x47a851dae305d99d:0xd828c3d3582ddfc4!4m20!1m8!3m7!1s0x47a851e0ce50d3fb:0x69ec81cf4ec66f34!2sHackescher+Markt,+10178+Berlin,+Germany!3b1!8m2!3d52.5237159!4d13.4022679!16s%2Fg%2F1tt1rqsd!3m10!1s0x47a851dae35ffc41:0x2059e3d3a52ca2ab!5m4!1s2025-08-02!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d52.514489!4d13.390907!16s%2Fg%2F11j1hx9rnc?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMxMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) is located (is this downtown?)

Premium Economy DC-Berlin?,"I have the opportunity to go to Germany this January, in about three months.

I just got back to the States from traveling around Europe for 6 weeks with my wife and 1.5yo son. Here is what I learned.,"
Edit: I actually had screwed up some formulas in my spreadsheet. The true cost of our trip was somewhere between 18-20k, as I'm too lazy to split all our credit card bills into travel/non-travel.

At first I was considering just posting a reel of pictures from my trip and collecting some modest comment karma, but instead I'd like to share my experience in a way that might benefit others who might be thinking of extended trips to Europe with a child of a similar age. Old enough to walk and enjoy things, young enough to be free on all modes of transport.

Our itinerary was Stockholm - Berlin - Munich - Riva, Italy - Genoa - Corsica - Rome.

1) The cost.

Our six weeks of travel cost about $18-20k My original early budget of $10,000 was completely delusional for the kind of trip we were looking to have. 12k of that was on accommodations and travel, and the rest on food, activities, and other things (travel insurance, car rental, etc..) You can definitely do it for less, but then you will be staying farther from city centers, cooking more at home, seeing fewer sights, and generally will be concerned more with budgeting. Personally, this approach was antithetical to the kind of trip we wanted to take. In our minds we were on a trip of a lifetime, and penny pinching seemed like it would just ruin our fun. I believe we made the right choice, though obviously we had to ensure that this was financially viable for us.

2) The work.

Roughly speaking, I took about 3 of those weeks off and worked for the other 3 weeks. Some were half days, some were a few hours off in the middle of a day, some were several days off at a time, all depending on circumstances. Being able to do this required a lot of prep communication with my colleagues on ensuring continuity and progress on our projects, but my job is extremely accommodating in this regard. My advice for those in remote jobs who are unsure if this is possible at their workplace is first closely research company policy, then find others who've worked remotely from Europe while employed at your company, and then bring it up with management. In my opinion, working in Europe on American (eastern, time zones more west might require a formal schedule adjustment on your part) time is perfect when traveling with a child. . They're up early, so you can go out and do stuff, go to playgrounds, museums, sights. Then your spouse can take over childcare for the first half of the workday (or you can take the first half of the day off) and for the second half of the workday the baby is sleeping and you can't go anywhere anyway, might as well work. At first I was concerned that work was going to be a huge bummer, but aside from a couple of days when I would have rather continued exploring Roman ruins or drinking beer in Munich, it was actually good to have a productive outlet rather than just have an extremely long vacation.

3) The childcare

If you are an average American family with a child, you likely get some occasional or regular help with your child or children from others, like your parents or a nanny, or daycare. When traveling, you will not have those people around (unless of course the grands or your nanny are going to travel with you). Having to take care of your child 24/7 without any help while on vacation is taxing and can feel like ""why the fuck am I doing this in the first place??"". I definitely had those thoughts. However, there are some important positives to this fact and ways to manage the weight.
The biggest benefit is the bonding experience. At home, my wife and I were both working, and trading off healthcare duties based on schedules and nanny availability. We were tired, unfocused, irritable. Often, we did not feel like our son was getting the best of us. On this vacation we were laser focused on him out of necessity. We were both present for all his little milestones and firsts, discoveries, foreign words he learned. His needs and presence were a blessing and opportunity to bond in a way that in my opinion would not have been possible in our particular situation.

3a) Outside childcare

This is apparently controversial, but mommy and daddy need a break sometimes. During this trip we employed the services of babysitters we found through reputable agencies, babysitters we found on Facebook (with a paper trail and references!!!), and of drop in day cares. The services available were dependent on location, and we had to get creative. Some hotels partner with babysitting agencies, some airbnbs have babysitting recommendations as an amenity, some cities have easy access to on-demand babysitting (Berlin) but drop-in daycare doesn't seem to exist as a concept (also Berlin). In Rome, we sent out emails to all kindergartens within reasonable distance of our Airbnb asking if we can drop our child off there. One said yes, and we used their services, but finding a babysitter seemed like a complicated process that we were ultimately not comfortable with. The going rate for a sitter from an agency in Stockholm is 60$ an hour. So we used facebook and found a fantastic sitter for 20$ an hour.
Do lots of research, send lots of emails, and ask lots of questions. As with anything related to parenting,  some people are going to judge you and claim that you're insane for ""letting strangers watch your child"". Well, a lot of strangers watched our child while on this trip and they all did a great job. Decide what you and your partner are comfortable with, set ground rules, and enjoy a much needed break while a (hopefully) qualified professional watches your child.",916,1000,1696187637.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16x9xki/i_just_got_back_to_the_states_from_traveling/,azzwhole

"Considering going to either Munich or Berlin, Germany for a few days before I go to Prague/Vienna/Budapest. Which city do you recommend?

As far as nightlife, I don't care too much about the clubbing scene (I'll be mostly jet lagged anyway), but I also don't want everything to be deserted or dead after dark and it would be cool to be able to grab a beer and hang out(I imagine this is true for both cities). As far as budget, I'm not too picky about accommodations, as long as they are clean. Although I'm guessing one city might be cheaper than the other? That could be a factor for which I would choose. Another consideration is which city is more ""unique"" and will have things that I wouldn't already see in Prague, Vienna, or Budapest? I know they are all different cities, but would want to go for a city that might offer me something that isn't too similar to those three cities. Or will I not really have to worry about that?

Sixt Berlin Beware,"Rented a sixt vehicle in Berlin on 6th Dec 2024. Good price, easy pickup...

Next day, the vehicle stopped working in the middle of my chores. And now the horror starts...

1. The English speaking customer service closes at 1600 CET
2. There is no case reference given when you call
3. There is no record of any promises made, details provided
4. No local phone number to call, so every time you have to go through the European automated call center

After an hour on phones, the best that Sixt came up with was to offer me another vehicle that was 35 minutes drive away.

Picked that one up, came back to the original one. The tow truck showed up but didn't wait for 10 minutes while I unloaded the broken vehicle.

So I had to leave the broken vehicle by the roadside and come back the next morning. The tow truck insisted that I travel with them to the repair shop, which took another hour. The Sixt recommended repair shop was not equipped to repair the vehicle, so the tow truck spent another 30 minutes to find out what next. Luckily, the driver told me that I can leave.

Now it is 11th March 2025, a full THREE months later... Got an email from Sixt stating that there is new damage to the broken vehicle and they want me to explain it.

Luckily, I had purchased full insurance. But this is so incompetent and unprofessional of Sixt!! 

To accept a return and then call back after THREE months to claim a damage?!?

I am trying to find the BBB equivalent in Europe and Germany to file a complaint.

So beware before you rent a Sixt vehicle in Europe... And keep ALL records!!",0,3,1741699343.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1j8qm0i/sixt_berlin_beware/,NaturalIngenuity5505

Copenhagen/Stockholm vs Berlin/Prague/Vienna in mid-September?," Hi all,

My BF and I (both mid-20s, from USA) want to go to Europe sometime in mid-September and need advice on what’s better suited for us based on our interests.

We were thinking a 10-14 days to either:

* Copenhagen > Malmo > Stockholm
* Berlin > Prague > Vienna

I’m doing research on both trips and am a bit conflicted on which is better suited for us.

We’re not big on night life (not big drinkers), so we're more of early risers. We love great food and would try fine dining, coffee shop, pastries, architecture, nature. We’re not big on museums, but I wouldn’t mind visiting 1 or 2 museums. We do however love walking around and visiting major landmarks while enjoying the city.

We are definitely more chill people and are okay with wandering around or staying an hour or two in a coffee shop relaxing. 

I’m leaning towards Copenhagen/Stockholm because it seems less busy and relaxing and we can maybe take more day trips, but Berlin/Prague/Vienna seem to have so much to offer that I feel like I would be missing so much (especially since Vienna and Prague seem to have much more interesting architecture, although Berlin is more so about the museums).

Does anyone have any thoughts about which trip they think would be better for us? Or just general facts that I'm overlooking? Also interested in your experiences if you've been to any of the cities I mentioned!

Traveling is not the same experience for women as it for men and it's insane what women face around the world,"Anyone who thinks traveling (or just traveling and honestly just existing) for women isn't hard - I urge you to think about the millions of women who face harassment. I myself have been either sexually assaulted, harassed, groped, catcalled heavily or followed in: Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Waterloo, London, Lisbon, Rome, and Naples. I was recently assaulted in Naples and posted about it to let people (esp women) know what can happen and instead I received messages from tons of men telling me I'm ""playing a sad victim"" and that I'm crying about it (I was literally hugged, groped, and kissed today by a total stranger on the street while walking)

It's not easy being a woman and still enjoying things worry free like men can and it sucks we've created a culture and a world where this is prevalent. I'm not saying men don't have to be worried about solo travelling, but women have to be worried about everything men do AND assault on top of that. It's to the point where I can't even go out at night when I have paid to travel to cities, or go to famous landmarks, or bars/clubs, or even take public transport at night. 

On top of that, things like pepper spray and such are illegal in so many countries and harming the other person (as self defence) may even result in the woman being punished if the law deems so. But we need to understand that women cannot defend themselves like men can in situations such as being attacked. We are simply not that strong physically. I know for a fact that I and many other women cannot get a man off us if we tried to. So why are we expecting the same ""self defense"" efforts from men and women? Knowing that using a pepper spray will get me in trouble with the law but the man who raped me can walk away if proven innocent blows my mind. 

I'm tired of following endless precautions yet still being targeted for things like this and assaulted. People are always blaming women too like ""oh you must've dressed wrong"" or ""you must have smiled at him"" and if not blaming women, people will only be giving tips out on what women can do to make sure that they are not assaulted. But WHY are we pinning everything on women and making it their responsibility? Why can't we teach guys that this is not okay by having stringent laws and punishments and just realizing the human factor when it comes to making laws regarding ""self defense"" because unfortunately, women are physically weaker.

I'm tired of hearing that ""this is the culture with [ ] men"" or that my clothes made it seem like ""I wanted it"". Traveling and just this world seems unfair for women and men need to acknowledge their privilege and advocate for changes too. It isn't cool if your buddy assaults me and then you just laugh as if it wasn't a big deal. It isn't cool for you to say that I just shouldn't travel if it's like this. It isn't cool for you to assume that anything I did caused this. ",2847,97,1714610632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ci2ddg/traveling_is_not_the_same_experience_for_women_as/,xrshxa
Final hours of my 16 months around the world trip,"**TLDR:** Made redundant at the end of 2022, didn't want to find another job. Packed up and travelled the world.

**update** done for now, flight soon, thanks for the questions. 

**update 2** ok really done now, boarding.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down. That coupled with the fact that we were cooped up after some of the most longest and strictest lockdowns it was time to get out and see the world.

The objective of the travels was essentially to explore and ""live"", as you will see most of the places we stayed were capital Cities. We ended up doing ALOT of day trips from the major capitals either by train or tour company. Most of the time it was much cheaper just to do a full day tour than to actually hire a car for the day.

Best way to get from Berlin to Budapest on December 31st?,"Hi!

I am traveling to Europe on Dec 17th. I'll be in Vienna Dec 18 to Dec 22, Prague Dec 22 to Dec 27, and Berlin Dec 27 to Dec 31. However I am also going to be in Budapest for New Years, from Dec 31 to Jan 2. I have booked hotels already in all places but I am trying to figure out the most effective way to get down from Berlin to Budapest. Is a 11 hour train ride worth it (as in beautiful scenery)? Or would a cheap flight (as well as additional baggage cost) be more effective so its less time traveling? This is my first time in central Europe so I want to try to make the best out of this. I also know that traveling New Years Eve may be tough so I'm not sure which mode of transport is best. I've heard so many horror stories about Ryanair and the like but are those small cheap flights within Europe bad?

Reccomendations for an extra stop near Paris/London/Berlin over christmas,"Hi all, please help me plug a hole in my itinerary!

I'm travelling through Europe over the christmas period, will be leaving Paris 19th Dec and need to be in Berlin by the evening of the 28th. Between then I'd like to spend 4-5 days collectively in London, including Christmas eve/day (visiting friends) but would love to include another city in that time. I'm completely flexible in my dates beyond Christmas in London, so would love recommendations for a \~2-3 day visit to another city that is a reasonable train/bus ride from one of London/Paris/Berlin (I don't mind adding one flight, but don't love the idea of flying both legs). 

Hopefully this makes sense but I see two sort of timelines here...

Paris (leave 19th) -> ? (19th-22nd)-> London (22nd-28th)-> fly to Berlin (arrive 28th)

Paris (leave 19th via Eurostar) -> London (19th - evening 25th/26th) -> ? (25/26th - 28th) -> Berlin (arrive 28th)

For reference I've visited all 3 cities before and spending 4+ days in each again so really looking for a cheeky new city to explore. Have never explored France outside of Paris, UK outside of London/Bath/Oxbridge or Germany outside of Berlin/Munich. Have visited Prague a couple times and well acquainted with Switzerland, otherwise open to any and all recommendations!

My least favourite city I have been to in Europe has got to be podgorica in montenegro! (sorry) found it pretty soulless to be honest.

My favourite I have two (cheating) hear me out.

1. Sarajevo. Was only in Sarajevo for one day and stayed overnight and it was awesome. Really charming city and full of soul as well.sarajevo was alot bigger than I thought it would be and the city centre has a really nice modern area.

2. Budapest. Me and my partner went to Budapest in February for a week and we really loved the city. Great people we met there.enjoyed learning the basics of the language too!! (hard!!) beautiful architecture and the city pretty big as well. Plenty to do!!

Should I visit Berlin or Dresden - I’m from Central Europe and don’t care about nightlife,"Hey all,

this month, I’ll be visiting Germany on a work trip. I’ll have two days to see a city relatively close to Leipzig, so I’m thinking of visiting either Berlin or Dresden.

I’m from Central Europe, so I’m not looking for any “special experiences” that might appeal to Americans, for example, as I’m used to living in the general area around Germany.

I’m mainly interested in seeing historical buildings. They don’t have to be very old, I also like relatively contemporary history. I don’t care at all about nightlife, drinking or pubs.

Like I said above, I’ll be staying in the chosen city for two days. I wanna take it slow and not rush to see everything at once (because I live close to Germany and can visit whenever. I’ve just never been to that part of Germany before).

I’m not constrained by money, but I don’t have a car, so I’ll be getting around via walking and public transit.

5 days left between Berlin and returning to Amsterdam,"Basically, I booked a return ticket (to Toronto) about 6 days after I plan to leave Berlin, departing from Amsterdam.

I travelled by train from Berlin→Málaga with my 🐕 - some tips,"Recently I went to visit some family living in Málaga. As I wanted to stay for a longer period (6 weeks), I brought my 25 kilo dog with me. It was quite a trek but I want to relay my experience in case anyone is hesitant to travel by train for such a long distance or bring a dog with them.

* **Day 1:** Berlin to Lyon - 11 hours of trains in total with a 1 hr layover in Frankfurt. Overnight in dog friendly hotel. Deutsche Bahn for leg 1 and SNCF for leg 2.
* **Day 2:** Lyon to Barcelona - 5.5 hours of trains with a 30 minute layover in Montpellier. Overnight with friends in BCN. SNCF both legs.
* **Day 3:** Barcelona to Madrid - 6 hours of trains with a 2 hour layover in Madrid. Ave high speed both legs.

I took a return route which was roughly the same.

Overall, really enjoyed the train journey. Breaking it up into three days was just the right amount. I didn't feel overwhelmed by the travel and had time to relax each evening in Lyon and Barcelona. It was a little bit much for my dog however, on day 1 he was quite restless and difficult to get him to settle. But he was a bit better on day 2 and 3, also helped that the train journeys were shorter.

**Most scenic parts:** Montpellier → Barcelona. and Madrid →Malaga. On the return journey it was a slightly different route through Germany, via Erfurt and Erlangen which is beautiful scenery but veeeeerrryyy slow.

**Best trains:** Ave in Spain was the quickest by Kmph and also the best prices. First class on SNCF was very comfy. DB first class was fine. Speaking of which...

**Tip:** Get first class tickets if you can. They were only about 20-30 euros more expensive on the French and German trains and worth it, especially with the dog.

**Dog friendly:** On the German and French trains you can take the dog with you on any train you want. You just need to muzzle it if it's in the aisle. Some conductors were more strict about this than others. Some also let me put him on the seat beside me as long as I put a blanket on it, others wouldn't let me. The Spanish trains only allow you to take dogs over 10 KG on very specific routes, and only one train a day on that route. More info here: [https://www.renfe.com/es/en/travel/informacion-util/pets](https://www.renfe.com/es/en/travel/informacion-util/pets) . However once you factor that in and plan accordingly, everything else was smooth. I like that they give you a little travel kit for the dog when you check in at the station!

**Cost:** I'm not going to lie, it was quite expensive overall - factoring in two hotels, dog tickets and many different trains. It cost roughly €1000 for the entire return trip. That said, if you are not travelling with a dog and/or you have friends in some cities on the way, you could reduce that cost a bit.

**What would I change next time:** I would go Berlin → Strasbourg, and then Strasbourg →BCN as that makes the travel roughly 8 hours each day. Secondly, I will check with my vet about a mild relaxant for my dog, to make the more stressful legs a bit easier on him.

Norse Check-in at Berlin,"Hello all, my wife and I have to make a self transfer at Berlin to JFK over a two hour layover. According to the airport website, we will be able to transfer without going out through security, and only passport control (EU to EU is our first flight).

I recognize that Norse only has check-in at their front desk, but I don't think we will make the transfer if we elect to go out to the front desk and then back through security. If we just make the transfer inside the airport, will we be able to check in at the gate? That's the only way I see a possibility of our making the connecting flight.

Thanks for your help!

EDIT: Ok everybody, thanks for your feedback. We made it! We had a 2 hour layover which shrunk to 1.5 hours when our Italian flight delayed 30 minutes (va bene), and we were still able to catch our Norse flight with a few minutes to spare. We BOOKED IT from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1, flat out ran our asses over there with everybody staring at us. The process was: disembark, baggage claim (we didn't have any), change terminals, Norse desk, security, passport control, gate. You can make a security appointment (called Runway) using a service on the Berlin airport website, which is free, but we didn't end up using ours, as our first flight was delayed. I even had enough time to buy a sandwich before boarding. You can also call the airport directly and speak to an English-speaking operator (+49 30 609160910); I spoke to two different operators and they were both extremely helpful.

Is 3-4 Cities too much in 14 Days (Munich-Berlin-London/Paris)?,"Hi everyone,

I have tickets to the Euro Cup in Munich this summer and was looking to pair it with a few other cities.

I was thinking of Berlin since is not too far and its where my grandmother had grew up and its nightlife

I also have friends in London and Paris (more so in London) and have never visited which I would like to see. It also appears much cheaper to fly or home from one of those cities vs Munich or Beron
back to Canada.

Has anyone done a trip similar and have any suggestions or things I should consider before finalizing for a 2 week trip. I am also willing to consider other German cities or countries too.",3,28,1706563875.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ae6tkz/is_34_cities_too_much_in_14_days/,bsauce97
Question on Qatar Airway's air-rail connection via Deutsche Bahn and Berlin BER airport,"Hi. I'm new to reddit and international traveling as a whole and would like to solicit some question on Qatar Airway's air-rail connection.

I'm planning on a upcoming trip to Germany in October/early November which will end in Dresden, flying back to Asia. I shopped around and noticed Qatar offers a ""air rail connection"" service from Dresden HBF Railway station (They call it 'XIR' on their website) to Berlin BER where the plane will fly out of Doha. In the plan, I will arrive at Dresden HBFThe timing and offering seems quite attractive to me, but I have a few doubts before committing myself to the ticket.

Specifically, I have the following questions:

1. From what I have heard from my German, Deutsche Bahn has been a shamble in recent years. Is the railway connection between Dresden and Berlin reliable?
2. On the website, the system estimate there will be a 2hr 17 min (or 2hr 57 min or 4 hours, depending on the train connection/flight i select) transfer time in BER. Suppose the connection is reliable, is a 3 hours connection time in BER sufficient? (For reference, I will both be leaving Schengen Area as a non-EU citizen and with both checked and hand-carry luggage.)
3. I'm quite curious for how is the ticket between the Dresden to Berlin leg is handled. As in: how many trains will i be riding, how many traintransfer at where, and how is the ticket being transferred to me.
4. If anyone have used Qatar's collaboration service with Deutsche Bahn, I would love to know if there are any interesting stories, quirks or things to look out for.

Sorry for the many questions. This is my first long-distance travel since many years and all the selection and planning are very daunting to me.



Thanks a lot.

Christmas eve things to do berlin and prague,"Hi All, 

I am travelling to berlin from prague. I'll be in prague 21-22 december. The plan is
23rd Reach berlin 
24-25th Do all the ""open"" things - Brandenburg gate, check point Charlie, berlin wall, memorial, east side gallery, street art, graffiti, christmas markets, clubs/christmas eve party
26th Musuems, Reichstag, Charlottenburg Palace
27th Anything missed, 7pm leave berlin

My question here is should I leave prague at the earliest and reach berlin by 11am to have more time in berlin or should I stay and explore prague? 
Will anything be open on 23rd? Initially I thought I'll do musuems on Monday but I saw all of them are generally closed on Mondays in berlin. Also a friend is joining on 24th. So I could space out some things but then I'll have to visit them again anyway with my friend. Hence the confusion

I am open to activities other than seeing tourist sights like going for some art workshop.

Tldr; where to spend major part of the dayof 23rd december prague or berlin?

Heathrow security staff lost our passport causing us to miss our flight,"So a few weeks ago my friend and I were travelling to Beirut from Heathrow airport. We went through security and her bag was moved aside for extra screening, but when she got it back she noticed the passport was no longer in there. 

We alerted security and they had started looking around for it, but were primarily focused on telling us to unpack our bags over and over. After we unpacked our bags for the 5th time, they started to realise the passport had been lost somewhere in the security area after the bag was put on the belt. They had about 3 staff looking for it without any luck. At this point our flight was leaving in 10 minutes. The icing on the cake was a security staff telling my friend that he’ll find my friends passport if ‘she smiles for him’.

Security suggest that we rush to the gate and see if they can let her on with drivers license. Obviously not allowed and who in their right mind would travel without a passport. At the gate we ask if there’s anything they can do to get us on the flight, and they say it’s out of their hands.

They close the gate and I shit you not 10 seconds later, a call comes in at the gate and it’s security saying they found the passport.

They FINALLY reviewed CCTV footage and saw that it fell from the bag and tray when a staff member moved it for extra screening. 

At that point it was too late and we had missed the flights. 

Heathrow hasn’t offered us any assistance let alone compensation for fumbling the passport. In fact the manager at the time justified it by saying ‘life isn’t fair’. We were left without a flight and they refused to put us up in accomodation for the night, telling us to sleep at the airport.

As well as losing out on our $1.2k flights, we had to fork out another $1.5k for accomodation and new flights as a result. 

Is Heathrow / the security company obligated to offer us some sort of compensation as they are at fault if losing the passport? 

If anyone has any recommendations we would LOVE to know.",1169,315,1688370642.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14pch70/heathrow_security_staff_lost_our_passport_causing/,12909216

Where to go by train from Berlin for a few days?,"I need to go somewhere from Berlin to work remotely for a week.

Ideally something laid back like Greece or Spain but at the same time not 40C outside.

Needs to have a good working and a social party atmosphere for a single 30 year old, and decently cheap prices on everything. I like to meet people, preferably to make genuine connections. I need something between a big city where people are too busy to answer, and a small city that's too boring

Prefer not Prague or Poland but I need to be there in a week anyway. So other cities in CZ might be ok, but I'm aiming toward western Europe more. I could go to Barcelona but I would need a expensive flight and I wanna go somewhere by train, preferably France.

All right, I'll go first.

I was once staying at a hostel in Berlin, during covid. Because of covid, Germany closed all of the hostels, and all travelers of other hostels were rebooked into a hotel, which happened to have dorm rooms. So there was this Swedish guy, who was there already for 5 months, who liked to drink his home made liquer and go out every night. This one night he came back at around 4 o'clock. He entered to room, grabbed my feet for a few seconds, and then went to bed.

I want to take my time while also seeing as many cool things as I can before I fly back to the my side of the globe.

  
I've got some ideas of what I want to see: definitely spend time exploring London and Berlin, stop off somewhere in the Netherlands, look into stopping off in Scotland or France (but I bet it will be very cold and dark in Scotland!). I'm super interested in the history and the culture, so looking for museums and old architecture, and anything else that will be a fun memory.

  
So my big questions are:

- Where should I explore outside the big cities in Netherlands/Germany?? Out-of-the-way tourist towns? Natural landscapes?

- Should I stop off in Scotland, France, Belgium? What's worth detouring for?

- What else should I try and see around England?

I have enough money to travel, but some country are now completly off my list for now for this reason. I can't seem to find anything in Barcelona, Rome or Berlin that's not north of 200$ for a terrible sketchy room. 

Even hostels now are crazy expensive for a single room.  I don't care about dorms, i'm not 18 anymore and I travel with my SO, 50-70 bucks for a dorm is nonsense still.

It's sad for young people. I was able to afford backpacking in Europe 10 years ago when I was 18, it seems it's impossible nowadays without couchsurfing.

also, if you're into some easy hiking, climb up to the Belvedere Santa Lucia, a watch the trulli houses from above. 

  
Visit Trullo Sovrano, the trulli house turned into a museum now and if you got any chances visit nearby towns like Locorotondo and Matera as well. Theyre beautiful and full of charm.

"Planning a 16 day trip to Europe this March to Berlin, Prague, Krakow and Budapest","I was wondering if you guys had any advice and if this plan is viable?

I'm going with a friend. The current plan is this:

* Spend the first 5 days in Berlin (with a day trip to Leipzig in between).
* From there we'll take the train down to Prague, and spend 3 days there.
* We'll take a domestic flight to Krakow, where we'll be for another 3 days.
* Then, we'll take yet another domestic flight to Budapest where we intend to stay for 3 or 4 days in total (haven't fully decided on this one yet).
* Finally, we'll take a flight back to Berlin where we'll fly back to the US the next day.

Is this a viable plan for 16 days? We were actually going to go 14 days originally, but we extended it to 16 so we can more easily fit in Krakow (in particular so we can see Auschwitz). I understand four locations in one trip is a lot, but I feel like 16 days should be enough to cover it. But I figured I'd ask others for their thoughts on this.

Also: In Budapest, we haven't decided if we'll take a day trip to Bratislava since that's only 2 hours away. We thought it might be cool to cross off another country on the trip.

My husband and I are planning a two week trip in late spring. It seems as though airfare is cheapest to fly in and out of Berlin so that’s the tentative plan. 

We were thinking of spending four days in Berlin, three days in Prague, three days in Vienna, and three days in Budapest. Is this cramming too much in one trip though? 

When on vacation we really enjoy driving and exploring the countryside. Also enjoy hiking, museums, World War II, history, museums, castles. Not so big on nightlife, but do enjoy good meals as most people do. 

Are we crazy to want to drive the entire trip? Often we plan our trips in a loop so that we’re not seeing the same sites both ways. This trip does not lend itself to that as much. Should we eliminate one of these cities? I feel like this trip would be much more doable with an open jaw flight. But those are much more expensive and there would be the additional expense of renting a car in one location and dropping it off in another.

Advice greatly appreciated!",2,23,1697826667.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17ci25a/berlinpragueviennabudapest/,lefty709

Budapest vs Prague vs Berlin - 5 days,"I have 5 days free after an Istanbul/Antalya trip and am planning on visiting two of these cities (I am thinking all 3 will be far too rushed). I'm also considering just doing one. 

27 solo male, planning on staying in hostels (hopefully social ones). 

Fairly frugal traveller so cheaper destinations are nice.

Looking for:

\-Good food 

\-Nice areas to walk around (good architecture, parks, etc.) 

\-Good nightlife (for at least a night or two)

\-Enjoy most tourist attractions, but don't need to fill my day with them

Vienna > Prague > Berlin Distribution,"Hi all,

I made a previous post about which Europe trip I should take in September and this community was such a huuuuge help!

|Day 1|7AM Land in Vienna|

|Day 2|Vienna||
|Day 3|Vienna||
|Day 4|Vienna (Day trip to Bratislava)||
|Day 5|Vienna||

* 5 nights in Vienna (1 day trip)
* 4 nights in Prague
* 1 day in Dresden (in between)
* 4 nights in Berlin

I originally wanted to spend more time (the most time) in Prague because it's the cheapest in terms of hotels and the plan was to spend like 6 days in Prague and have 2 day trips (Dresden and maybe Cesky Krumlov), but visiting Dresden in between Prague and Berlin seems to make more sense.

"Berlin, Leipzig, or Dresden?","Hi all,

My itinerary (travelling solo, 21M) has a gap where I leave from the Erfurt area in Germany and have 8 days to arrive in Vienna (neither can change) this April

My current plan is to go Berlin, Prague, then Bratislava, but after some research I’m starting to have doubts

I’m interested in photography, architecture, and will refuse to enter anywhere with loud music and alcohol. A lot of people have mentioned Berlin as this kind of city, which makes me think whether I should go to Dresden/Leipzig instead, or even skip one of Prague or Bratislava if Berlin shouldn’t be missed?

Haven’t visited any of these places before and I don’t have preference other than photography and architecture. Budget is tight, slightly negotiable, but not a primary concern for the right plans

Berlin Vs Stockholm for summer solo trip,"I'm a 19 year old from the UK and am planning my first international solo travelling experience during the late summer and am stuck between choosing Berlin or Stockholm as my place to visit. I kinda want this trip to be on a budget (about £1000 total) since I'm learning to drive and am going to uni soon but am ok to splurge a little.

Berlin was the first place I was considering since I've never been before, the accommodation is surprisingly cheap at that time of year and I always love travelling to London since I enjoy all the different cultures and areas there and I feel Berlin would be a similar experience. Plus the city seems to have an interesting history with its involvement in the cold war. If I were to go I would also try and visit nearby cities such as Hamburg for some variety. What puts me off Berlin is the fact I've already visited parts of Germany in the past and I kinda want to go somewhere new and experience a new culture. Plus I hear Berlin has the reputation of having a big club scene and being an introvert who doesn't go clubbing or drink that doesn't really sound like my sort of thing meaning I might struggle to fit into the city.

Stockholm is another place I've been considering. I've never been to Sweden or that far north as a matter of fact so I feel it would be a new experience for me. It also seems far more relaxed compared to Berlin which feels more appealing to me. Plus I'm not the biggest fan of hot weather and with it being slightly more North compared to Berlin I would hope it would be more cooler. Like Berlin if I were to go I would also make an effort to try and visit different places in Sweden while I'm there. What puts me off is how expensive Sweden apparently is and I don't want to spend too much money while I'm away. Plus it's smaller than Berlin so I may get bored of it more quickly.

So does anyone have any thoughts about what may be a good place for me?",0,5,1719274422.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dnsndg/berlin_vs_stockholm_for_summer_solo_trip/,Fartnite111
2-3 weeks. Starting in Berlin. Where to after?,"Hey r/travel.

In October 2025, I will be travelling to Berlin (for the Berlin Marathon) to start my trip, flying from Vancouver, Canada. I am very unfamiliar with Europe in general so I'm struggling on how to plan the rest of the trip. This would be my first time travelling to Europe.

I would be 26 for this trip. I'm not the most interested in walking through museums and such but I can enjoy some things to sightsee. Also not particular in partying. I think my goal of this trip is to experience all the new cultures, foods, and sights.

One thing to consider is there is a chance that my parents would be joining me for this trip. With this in mind, places that are walk-friendly would be a plus.

Right now, I think making my way west to Amsterdam -> Brussels -> and ending in Paris. I am open to suggestions about other cities to visit in between. For this route, a quick Google search looks like costs are comparable? I think I read in some threads I was randomly browsing is these two modes of travel could be comparable, but different levels of hassle of going to the airport, security, etc.

The other route I'm considering is going to Prague -> maybe Vienna? -> somewhere in Italy.

My budget isn't clear right now but I don't expect to be desparately frugal. However, which route would is more economical in terms of travel, food, and accomodations?

Thanks! It's over a year from this planned trip but I feel the need to do my research early.",0,8,1714263182.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cet3kn/23_weeks_starting_in_berlin_where_to_after/,kyleyle
"Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, or Elsewhere?","I have a work meeting in Belgium mid-April where I am fortunate enough to be able to extend my trip by 6 days for a personal vacation. The work meeting ends Thursday night and I am free to go wherever Friday morning. I only have to be back in Brussels the following Thursday for my return flight to the US.

I am a recently single 32 y/o guy looking to meet new people, party, visit cool bars/cafes, learn history and appreciate architecture, and eat some tasty food (in that order of importance).

Berlin (Cold War history) and Munich travel (late October),"My fiance and I are going to Germany in late October.

We will be spending 3 days in both Munich and Berlin (taking the train between the cities).  

We like museums (and not art though, but more history).  We enjoy German beer, history, food, and good scenery.  I don't need crazy nightlife (we are pub people more than club people) and I'm fine being back at my hotel by midnight.

I am big into the history around the Cold War, so I know there will be things to do in Berlin for me.  What would you recommend?  And where do you recommend staying in Berlin?  
For Munich, I guess what do you recommend we do or see there?

"10 Days in Germany. Considering Cologne, then Berlin, then Munich. Would you do this? Any other suggestions?","I will have 10 days in Germany from NOV 23 - 2 DEC. My Main draw is the Christmas Markets, but having never been to Germany I will be heavily focusing on the regular tourist sights during the day. Berlin and Munich do not start their Christmas Markets until the 27th, Cologne's starts on the 23rd. 


My current idea is as follows:  


*23rd - Land in Frankfurt - Take train to Cologne. Plane lands at noon. Giving customs 2 hours, and the 2:40 train that takes an hour I should arrive in Cologne at 3:30pm. Enjoy first night of Christmas Festival  

*24th - Other threads suggest Cologne can be seen in a day or two. Considering seeing a bit more of Cologne this morning then taking train to Berlin (Possibly a train I can sleep on at 11pm or so?)  

*25th - Looks like there is an 11PM sleeper train that could get me to Berlin at 8am. Stay in Berlin through the 28th - allowing one night of Berlin's Christmas market  

*29th - Train to Munich. Unsure of when. Looking like there aren't really any night trains with beds between this route? Stay in Munich until flying out on the 2nd  



When traveling I like to utilize every minute. Combining sleep with travel sounds incredible to me - I can deal with it being a little less comfortable than a hotel room for two of the nights.

I was initially hoping to see a second, neighboring country - literally any of them. I am open to leaving out Cologne entirely, as I will still get to enjoy the Christmas markets from the 27th on in both Berlin and Munich, but the flights directly to Frankfurt works well with my intended leaving time-frame, and Cologne is just up the road - feels like its hard to pass up? I would love to take an almost striaght shot from Berlin > Prague > Munich, but I am thinking 10 days will not be enough to really get a quality experience of all three. Doing that would mean leaving Berlin before the christmas festival starts, and Prague's does not begin until after I return home, leaving only Munich's christmas festival. That may be acceptable if Munich's is a top notch experience. That I have no idea about, seems there are so many any just as many differing opinions on each one. I am also entertaining the idea of my first stop being somewhere other than Germany, and arriving to spend the latter half of the trip between Berlin/Munich. A few days elsewhere, and a sleeper train right into Berlin, maybe.

Any suggestions here? Is this clean, concise and worth it?

"Copenhagen, Berlin, and Prague?","Copenhagen, Berlin, and Prague?

My husband are I are thinking on planning a trip to those three places at the end of August to early September.  We’re thinking of flying out of Toronto to Copenhagen, then flying to Berlin, taking a train to Prague, then flying out of Prague back to Toronto.

We were thinking about four nights in each city.  I visited Berlin in 2018, and I loved that city.  Everything about it was amazing.  I’ve always wanted to visit Copenhagen, and Prague seems very cool.

On our honeymoon, we went to Amsterdam, Belgium (Bruges, Ghent, and Brussels), and Reims and Paris.  Paris was our favorite, then Bruges, Amsterdam, Ghent/Brussels, Reims.  Unfortunately, we only planned one night in Ghent and Brussels, which might have contributed to their position.  I loved Amsterdam’s scenery and museums, but I liked French and Belgian food a lot more.

A few questions:
1. Does this sound like a good plan? 
2. We were thinking of doing a day trip to Malmo while we’re in Copenhagen.  Is it worth it?
3.  Are there any days to avoid in these cities?  For example, any day where most things are closed?  On the other hand, do any of these cities have a great day to visit.  We went to Mexico City this past summer, and Saturday was a lot of fun with the markets.
4.  Is four days / nights each a good way to distribute the time?
5.  If there’s a city that you’d recommend instead of Copenhagen or Prague, please let us know!

Our interests include eating, drinking, markets, museums, cats and dogs, quirky museums, etc.  We like sight seeing too - I’ve heard that the train from Berlin to Prague is beautiful.

If you have any other suggestions, please let me know!  Thank you!",6,28,1672872167.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/103hk3z/copenhagen_berlin_and_prague/,abbeycrombie

Which is a better airport - Prague or Berlin w Austrian Air,"Does anyone have experiences with these airports/ airline for arrival, baggage, check-in, security, & food options? 

I have to decide on a flight from Vienna (using Austrian Air) to either Prague or Berlin where I connect with an Icelandair to Keflavik.  The cost differences are minimal.  It will be on a Friday morning (if that makes any difference).  There will be checked bags. 

VIE - PRG - dep. 09:45. arr. 10:35   

VIE- BER - dep. 09:15. arr. 10:25

  
Both of the IcelandAir flights from PRG & BER to Keflavik  -  dep. @ 14:05.  

 There are more flights from VIE - BER if there's a problem. But will it take longer to pick up baggage, check in w Icelandair  & process security at Berlin?  (We have Global Entry, but that's just for US).

Best way to travel from Berlin to Amsterdam by train with luggage?,"So i decided to spend the entire month travelling through europe with my girlfriend and in a couple of days we’ll be taking an ICE train from Berlin to Amsterdam.

I couldn’t find a single spot to place even one piece of luggage regardless of booking first class and seat reservations. The reason i decided to travel by train is because i read online people saying that i would be just fine, but if i knew what was coming i would have taken a plane.

She is not open listening to my ideas or just go and see all on the way of one destination. She doesn’t like to walk I discovered, coffee is to cold or to hot ….. hahaha all is wrong all the time, she doesn’t do mistakes only others. She say Berlin is ugly and didn’t even go anywhere. I just left her in the hotel and told her with apology that I would like to see stuff and not keep waiting for her since we have limited time in Berlin. What do you think guys.

How can we go from Berlin to Toronto in May 2024 with a cat? Seems awfully difficult to find good flights back home.,"My wife and I plan to travel back to Toronto with our cat, and it's very difficult to find anything.

Iceland air states that they do not allow animals on stopover flights, so this is a no go.

Our only option is a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt (I'm not sure how bringing an animal on this AIRBUS A321NEO domestic flight will work).

Also should we stay on the flights that are operated by the same airline? Or should we switch to a flight that will be operated by first Lufthansa (Berlin to Frankfurt), and then Air Canada going from Frankfurt to Toronto.

Or maybe should we take the train from Berlin to Frankfurt, then just take the flight there..?",0,12,1699706423.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17stkgg/how_can_we_go_from_berlin_to_toronto_in_may_2024/,WSBTurnipGod

Berlin=>Sarajevo=>Berlin – without airplane,"Hey,

I have a 4 day stay in Sarajevo coming up mid of April '24 and I was wondering if you have ideas how I can get cost efficient (and especially hassle-reduced) from Berlin, Germany to Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzogovina.

I'd like to avoid travel by plane from Berlin to there (if possible – if not, please recommend me your departure airport), so ideally it's a 1-2-stop journey, potentially in Zurich, Munich, Vienna, Graz, Zagreb or Budapest. I enjoy night/sleeping trains!

I'm looking for an interesting and pretty city to have the stop(s) and some good deals on the last mile from there to Sarajevo.

Practical data SIM/eSIM readily available in Berlin Airport,"Hi all!
New to this sub, if this has been asked already; would appreciate it if we find the link to this discussion.

Have an upcoming trip to Germany in April and be landing in Berlin Airport, trip will last for 2 weeks. I will be needing a data SIM. It doesn't matter if it's physical or eSIM.

I already have Airalo (they work great in Asian countries, I read that they are not so reliable in Europe) and also from their package I feel they are quite expensive compared to where I am currently.

Can you recommend a provider that offers value for money with fast and reliable connection? I may be using it for video calls/meetings and work related stuff but nothing more than that, like games and stuffs.
It'd great if I can pick them up or buy them at the airport when we land.

I've posted Airalo's offering in Germany:

2 Day Trip Suggestions from Berlin,"So, I will be in Berlin in September for a work conference. I am planning to take my wife with me. We'll explore Berlin in the evenings together and she'll be solo during the day when I'm at the conference. The conference ends on a Thursday and I'm thinking we will fly home on Sunday (for work purposes it's easiest if I fly back from Berlin, however I'll look at itineraries and work out what makes the most sense).

This would leave us available to travel on Thursday afternoon/evening and not needing to fly home until Sunday around mid-day (again, this could be out of Berlin at mid-day or wherever we end up going for the weekend depending on what makes the most sense). Since it's only 2 days I'd like to go somewhere that I can get a direct flight from Berlin or worst case a very quick layover so that we are spending Thursday night in a hotel rather than on a red eye.

My goal would be try to keep these flights to under $1,000 for two adults although this is not my primary concern. Obviously if there is something with EasyJet/Ryanair that wouldn't be too hard, but I'd prefer to stay away from these types of airlines if possible. I'm fairly open to suggestions on the specific destination. We enjoy food, art and culture, but also wouldn't mind a relaxing couple of days on the Mediterranean if that seems to be the best option. I do not want to stay in Germany. I'm probably going to start the trip with 1-2 days in Munich already and then we'll be in Berlin for 3 more, we will want to leave Germany by that point. Also, no Paris. We've both been to Paris multiple times and absolutely love it, but for this I would prefer to do something different. I would probably rule out anywhere in the middle east as well.

When I plug Berlin to Anywhere into the Google tool the first things that jump out at me are Rome, Athens and Barcelona (the only one of these I've personally been to is Rome and there's still a lot I haven't seen - my wife hasn't been to any of these locations). Cairo is very tempting as well, although it's a little more expensive and I'm not sure if 2 days would be enough time. I should also add that I'm not opposed to train travel. Prague is another one that could be on my list which would be an easy train journey from Berlin. Let me know your thoughts. If you had Thursday to Sunday free and your starting point was Berlin where would you go and why?

"Germany Advice: Berlin, Hamburg and...?","I am going to Germany soon for a couple of concerts, in Berlin and Hamburg. I'll be there two weeks. As an American and former art school weirdo, Berlin is my ""Paris"", the European city of my daydreams, and I'm excited for art, history, fashion and nightlife. Hamburg also sounds great and I'd like to have a decent amount of time there.

Should I add a third thing? I like the idea of seeing the Baltic Sea, so I was thinking of visiting Rostock/Warnemünde. It will still be winter but I love the ocean all the time. My other thought was to visit Quedlinburg, as the Harz Mountains look beautiful. However, I don't drive and will be relying on trains/public transit so I'm not sure how accessible the area would be. Would it be worth it to visit one of these places for a day or two, or should I just hang out in the big cities? Or is there some other amazing thing I'm overlooking?

I am from India and she lives in Berlin, Germany. I'll be flying to Berlin and then we plan to cover Amsterdam and French Riviera along with Berlin.

I've never been to Europe and she also has spent almost all her life in India (went to college in Berlin this year). Asking for any and all suggestions related to any must visit places/accomodation or travel hacks etc. (literally anything could help as we have very less idea)

Keep in mind that we've both just started earning to want to keep it budget friendly.

Also posting a few lingering questions here if anyone can help me with these.

Thanks in advance!

I know it's a long post. So please feel free to read and answer to only 1 or fee of the questions below. 

1. Were thinking of staying in AirBNBs at every place except Berlin where she has her own place. Please confirm if this is the best way to stay.

2. Travel: We intend to travel via trains in Berlin, to amsterdam, flight from Amsterdam to Cannes and travelling within french Riviera by train and then back via flight to Berlin. Please confirm if this seems like the best way.

3. Which would be the best town to make base in the French Riviera? We plan to make base in one town and do day trips to other places we want to visit.

4. Amsterdam nightlife: must visits?

5. Amsterdam red light area: must visits?

6. We also want to try going to a nude beach. Which would be the most comfortable one in French Riviera for someone who has never gone to one.

7. Any other good couple activities/romantic destinations we should look to go to?

Advice on train or plane Paris to Berlin,"Hi there! Looking for advice from folks who have decided to take the longer train ride instead of flying between cities in Europe. I'll be traveling by flight for most of the trip so also thinking it might be nice to switch it up when I can.

If I take a flight, it will be a 2ish hour flight but would take an hour to get from each city center to the airport and vice versa, plus time going through security etc, so in total **door-to-door 6.5 hours**. Also note that it would be a bit cheaper to take the train.

The train would be about **10 hours door-to-door** with the train ride itself being 9 hours (including 2 transfers).

Is it silly/miserable to take the long train ride instead, or make sense/might be more enjoyable? Most of the day will be travel either way, and I'm thinking it might be a bit less shlepping around with my suitcase if I train.

My home base will be at my uncle/aunt's house in Berlin so I won't need to pay for lodging/food for about half the trip, just meals out and entertainment etc. I also have about $1.5k USD in Euros, a gift from my boss.

The problem arrises that my debit card has a 1% FTF, my credit card (which is discover if that's relevant) has a $1000 credit limit, and I've heard it's best to stay under 30% credit utilization. I imagine I could easily spend over $300 on lodging (hostels) and food alone being away from Berlin for less than a week. However I'm not entirely clear on the effect of credit utilization on credit score- does it really matter if I have no problem paying it all off and I go back to 10% avg utilization when I get back from the trip? I'm certainly not planning on having any credit inquiries in the next 6-9 months. Paying off my credit card every time it nears $300 is inconvenient but an option, though I'd still use my debit for ATMs if I needed more cash. I'm also considering trying to open a new checking account and get a new debit card with no FTF, or just saying fuck the credit utilization and paying off my credit card when it nears $1000. The internet told me places that accept credit/debit are uncommon in Germany but my dad who's visited Berlin twice in the last decade said he hardly used Euros at all. I admit I don't have a very concrete plan on where I'm going to visit outside of Berlin, I'm kinda playing it by ear 🫣

The best option with my limited knowledge seems like paying off my credit card before $300 as much as I can and using it for all purchases it's accepted for, using Euros only when mandatory, and having the debit card if I run out of Euros or an emergency. Is this the right choice?",2,4,1706579757.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1aecspi/cash_vs_credit_vs_debit_in_europe_mainly/,rowan__11

Road Trip - Any suggestions for hotels with parking in Hamburg and Berlin,"Hi,

I don't often post on Reddit but I often see some very helpful replies for people asking for help and advice. If this is the wrong subreddit for this question then I'm happy to be pointed in the right direction.

I'm planning a road trip this year and the first stop will be in Hamburg for a night to visit the miniature wonderland the following morning. After that, I will be driving to Berlin for two nights to see the sights and a show.

If anyone knows of any hotels that have parking (underground?) in these cities then it would be a great help.

Other tips or things to see wouldn't go amiss either!

"Heading to Berlin, like history, suggested tours/agents/sights","I'm going to Berlin soon. I've been once for Biz and spent a weekend on Museum Island which was stunning. I'll do that again. But I didn't have time for tours, historical, Nazi terror, Cold war stuff.

Suggestions for sights and tours?  


TLDR; Background of this trip (for the idle curious, nothing to do with the question):

We are busy moving into our overly delayed remodel and dealing with finishing up, final punch lists etc, but decided to visit Germany anyhow because we're Jewish and my wife's family who survived fled to Israel and the US. Now the town where they were from has a 1200 year celebration/""we're sorry we killed your families, here's some music and dialog"" tour. I figure it might be interesting and the hotels and food are free for a couple of days in a small historical town. Plus, we'll meet some of the distantly related family. I have my own attitudes towards genocide etc. Don't hold it against the children that their parents sat by or actively murdered. Genocide is the extreme form of human ingroup/outgroup tribalism/big alpha-leader behavior. It's universal, I don't know that I'm in any way ""morally superior"" nor know that I would have taken a stand (as I hope I would have). My take is that the children should especially mourn what was lost: Due to once in millennial particulars of inbreeding, cultural isolation and intensive religious worship of learning, the group of Jews that they killed had been producing a disproportionate percent of the greatest scientists, philosophers, artists the world has seen (let's say from 1/billion to 1/million ratio). 2/3s of that productive group were murdered. We might have already cured cancer, or tinnitus, or depression etc. Beyond the humanity of the situation, that's the direct (and unknowable) loss. After this visit, my kids have to get back to work so we have just enough time for a few days in Berlin which they have not seen.",1,8,1689187093.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14xwt7r/heading_to_berlin_like_history_suggested/,blarryg

Is 14 days enough for London/Paris/Amsterdam/Berlin?,"My gf and I are traveling in December of this year and already have our tickets to London booked. The plan is this:

Land in London on the morning of the 15th > Eurostar to Paris that same day and stay until the 18th > Take a train to Amsterdam on the 18th and stay until the 20th > Take a flight to Berlin on the 20th and stay until the 23rd > Fly back to London on the 23rd and stay until we fly home to the US on the 29th

I've got family in London, so that's why we're staying there the longest. Amsterdam isn't necessarily a must and I know only one full day of exploration won't do the Netherlands justice, but it's pretty close to Paris and I would like to visit. 


Does this seem rushed? Should we allot more time to Amsterdam? Just cut it out completely? Does the order of the countries make sense? I've thought about cutting Berlin but I'm much more interested in going there vs Amsterdam, but it is definitely out of the way (hence the flight). I would have preferred for our only flights to be to and from London and to travel by train only once we're in Europe, but it seems like too much travel time to get to Berlin and then eventually back to London if going by train.

Planning a 2 week trip to Central Europe (Berlin>Prague >Krakow>Vienna) in 2023. Some questions about visiting in the winter.,"My sister and I are (hopefully) going on our first international trip in 2023. We were planning on going at the end of November. This would get us some free vacation days from Thanksgiving and hopefully see some Christmas markets. However I have a few questions. 

* Thanksgiving is on Nov 23 and 24. Will Christmas Markets be open then? Googling this mostly brings up information for 2022/2021.

* How is traveling around central Europe in the winter? I am from the Midwest so I am used to moderate cold. I am more concerned about public transit. We plan on using it to get around cities and taking (overnight?) trains between cities.

* The most ""rural"" place we will be going will be a day trip from Krakow to see Auschwitz. Not sure if we should be concerned about getting there in winter.

* I know days are going to be shorter but will they be TOO short in winter? Should we be worried about tourist things being closed during this time?

I have some non weather related questions as well!

My main goals were to visit Berlin and Krakow, since we will be spending two weeks people suggested I visit Prague and Vienna as well. Does the route of Berlin>Prague >Krakow>Vienna make the most sense?

Our plan was also 4 days in Berlin, 3 days in Prague, 2(.5) days in Krakow, and 3 days in Vienna. Should that be enough time in each place? Should we cut out a city and spend more time someplace else?

"Going to Berlin in a couple weeks on a budget, need recommendations of things to do","Like the title says, I’m leaving for Berlin in less than two weeks. It’ll be my first time visiting as an adult (last visit was at 16, 11 years ago) and I have no idea what I’ll be doing for most of the trip. I’ll only have about $800 for the two weeks and will need to budget a good bit.",1,1,1699568661.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17rotj5/going_to_berlin_in_a_couple_weeks_on_a_budget/,wasted-spac3

Berlin at Christmas,"Hi All,

Me and my girlfriend are going to Berlin in a couple weeks, planning on going to the christmas markets, Berlin wall, memorials, and botanical gardens but we are now getting concerned these places may be closed or at least restricted. Was hoping to get advice from someone who's been there recently or lives there on how open/accessible things are in Berlin atm?",7,24,1637697574.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/r0lrpa/berlin_at_christmas/,ajl97

Beer (Vienna-Berlin),"I heard from a friend from Brussels that there are bars that have those little glasses you can taste different kinds/brands of beers. (Like in one order you get 10 different beers. I don't know if it was clear lol) 

My question is, are there any places in Berlin and Vienna that have this? I will travel this summer and I thought it would be great to taste as many different beers as possible since these countries are in the beer side of Europe.",9,7,1682697195.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/131ylro/beer_viennaberlin/,Pechorin-v-stambule
Is it possible to drive from Berlin Germany to Pattaya Thailand.,"Thailand is on mainland Asia which is land connected with mainland Europe where Germany Poland Spain etc. are. so would it be physically possible to drive from Europe to Thailand without the use of a ferry? For some reason google maps says cant find a way there by car from Germany to Thailand, It does however give me a walking roue of 100 days to Thailand. Driving from Berlin to Accra in Ghana is routable by car with an estimated trip of 6 days. Yes flying is faster and almost everyone will suggest it but I'm really interested in overland car trips from Europe to Asia its not like everyday someone were to drive from eg Delhi to London or Moscow to Nairobi. I wouldn't even mind a month in the car as long as im seeing new places and meeting cool people.",7,17,1657659127.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/vxlboy/is_it_possible_to_drive_from_berlin_germany_to/,Right-Echo-1849

Singapore-Berlin by bus and train,"This October, I’m going to Japan for an exchange semester. The last weeks, I’ve been sketching out a “little” trip for the time after that semester.

&#x200B;

In short: Starting from Singapore, I want to travel back home to Berlin without going by plane.

&#x200B;

I’ve figured out 2 routes + 1 alternative, which seem to be doable. These are not final yet though, since I might want to stay a few days in some places or visit some more. For the routes, I just focused on finding a way home. In general, I’d rather take the train than going by bus, even if it is a little more expensive (but not overly expensive) or takes more time. I also wanted to avoid going to Russia. The start of this project would be March or April 2024, depending on how long the exam period at my exchange university will take.

&#x200B;

I’ve created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_zVg2KZfXBckAvVjiAiQvHFFs5zzti5ZWk28ePZn4o/edit?usp=sharing) with the most important information (I’m quite proud of it tbh \^\^’)

Route 2 would probably be my most desired route, since I always wanted to visit Nepal, but it got quite some gaps in the public transportation department with the biggest problem being, that there isn’t really a good way to cross the border between Myanmar and India by public transport. I could imagine myself going to hike to the Nepal-China border (if possible, of course).

Route 1 & 2 share the same big public transport gap between Aktau and Kuryk.

Route 1.5 would be the alternative, since it would include Nepal and avoid any big transportation gaps. But I would have to take the plane back home to Berlin.

&#x200B;

The most information for this has been gathered through [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) and [seat61](https://www.seat61.com/index.html).

I you guys have any ideas for a better route or even solutions for my transport gaps, please feel free to share them. Also, feedback and other recommendations are appreciated too.

&#x200B;

*One more thing:*

For now, I’ve been planning just for myself, but if anybody is interested, I’m looking for travel buddies, that might be crazy enough to join my journey. Feel free to contact me :)
