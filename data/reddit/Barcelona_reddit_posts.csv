I thought Barcelona was overrated. Until I went.,"I was in France visiting family when I found out I has a bonus week off for time in lieu so I decided to take a long weekend somewhere. My criteria was not too far from where I was, accessible by public transport, and easy to get home from. Barcelona fit the bill, tickets were fairly cheap so I went. 

I'd heard people raving about how beautiful the architecture and the history is but to be honest, I don't care much about architecture and history. Most of my trips are to remote, isolated places with beautiful natural scenery. I just wanted a place to lay on the beach and relax. I've been to Paris and absolutely hated it. It was cramped, smelly and full of tourists (yes, I recognise the irony) 

It's a amazing city. Most places are easy walking distance from the city centre. The beach is really clean and well maintained. The government has staff to pick up litter from the beach and the sea, and the facilities are surprisingly decent (for public toilets). 

I went to check out some of the tourist sites when it was too hot to lay on the beach and I was impressed at how many of them are in such close proximity, and are free to view or a small donation. 

Overall, things were pretty easy and there was a laid back atmosphere. It's clearly a tourist destination but it didn't feel like a rip off tourist trap like some places 

If you were on the fence about Barcelona, give it a shot. I'd stay longer if I could",2004,441,1690208089.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/158bwqm/i_thought_barcelona_was_overrated_until_i_went/,tomgrouch
I really enjoyed Barcelona,"I’ve been to London and Paris which I liked. This was my first time in Spain.

The highlights for me were:
Montserrat omg the views there were amazing 😍 Glad I didn’t listen to some reviews who said to skip it.

Costa Brava- climbed to the top of the view point and got a great view of the coast. Water was cold but it was beautiful.

Park Güell-lots of tourists who hogged the best views but it was so beautiful. I could’ve stayed there til it closed.

Sagrada Família-of course and just the architecture in general.

Picasso museum and casa Batlló were just ok. Didn’t wow me. 

Also I did the hop off and on bus which I didn’t initially plan to but really enjoyed it. Not sure why more people don’t recommend it.

The food was just ok. Don’t shoot me. Wasn’t bad but again okay. I did have some good sangria I know that’s not what the locals drink but..Cava was cool too.

I guess it’s a city people love or hate but I’m glad I went.

Didn’t have any issues with pickpockets thank God. Had a cross body bag that was mostly under my jacket. Nothing in my pockets. Felt safe. I didn’t take transportation bc my friend preferred cabs.

Barcelona was underwhelming,"Visited Barcelona recently for a few days as part of a larger Spain trip. I had very high hopes because of how much praise and hype Barcelona always gets. 

Honestly though…I was a little disappointed and in fact, I would probably place it as my least favourite place out of everywhere I visited in Spain (Madrid, Granada, Sevilla and San Sebastián). 

Some of the architecture is cool but I felt like there’s nothing that it offers that other major European cities don’t do better. It was smelly and kinda dirty, and I felt some weird hostile vibes as a tourist as well. The food was just decent, and none of the attractions really blew me away, other than Sagrada Familia. The public transit and walkability is *fine* but again, nothing amazing. 

I usually like to judge a place based on its own merits but while in Barcelona I couldn’t help but compare it to other major European cities I’ve been and loved, like Rome, Paris, Lisbon, London, Prague, Istanbul (kinda counts I guess) etc. and finding it a bit lacking.",1159,765,1724721587.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f24vjj/barcelona_was_underwhelming/,Wooden_Mood_3359
Is Barcelona still a good place to visit?,"I know it's kind of extremely cliche but I've never been to Spain. 

I'm just wondering if the stories of locals literally aggressing tourists in restaurants with water pistols and the like are exaggerated. 

Like I'd love to visit but at the same time i want to have a good time and if the locals are that sick of tourists i can just go elsewhere.

So I'm wondering if anyone here has recent experience to share about Barcelona?

Overtourism has ruined Barcelona,"I recently visited Barcelona despite the repeated advice not to go.

I had heard about all the anti-tourist protest and the general decline of city but went anyways.

From the moment I got to the city center I realized just how insane the overtourism situation was. There were crowds of people EVERYWHERE. Every attraction, park, and metro station was packed despite this not even being the peak summer season.

The huge tourism numbers also just changed the local economy so much that everything was a tourist trap. 

Every cafe and restaurant close to the major sites had terrible reviews detailed various tricks and scams they used on tourist. There were also all these brightly lit convenience stores everywhere with outrage prices.

Beyond the crowds and tourist traps what really made me hate the city was the aggression from the locals. 

They DID NOT want to interact with anyone who was not a local and clearly hated tourists. When I was using the self checkout at the grocery store I needed help so I taped the request assistant button and some old women walked up, tapped the screen to close the request, and walked away without even looking at me. Later when I was at the airport I tried to ask one of the airport employees for direction to the check-in counters and she just yelled loudly ""No entiendo!"".

Needless to say, I won't be returning to Barcelona.",0,33,1738585398.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ignuqn/overtourism_has_ruined_barcelona/,Candid-End-6364
Barcelona airport security took my husband to a locked room by himself and forgot him,"My husband got SSSS on his boarding pass and went through that additional screening. After that, they took him to an empty room and told him to wait there. After waiting a while he tried to open the door and realized it was locked. After almost an hour he started yelling, which got someone to come. They were shocked to see him and asked how long he was in there.

What if no one heard him yelling? What if he had a heart attack in there? I feel like this is so much worse than just a customer service issue.

Saw a woman traveling alone leave her duffel bag at a gate and swiftly walk away at Barcelona airport,"I was recently traveling alone in Europe for work and when I was departing back home from the Barcelona airport, I witnessed something that freaked me out so much and want to know what others think. As an American living in the post-9/11 travel world, it is a huge no-no to leave bags unattended anywhere in the airport, so not sure if this is a rule internationally as well but want to hear from others who might know more. Here goes:

I arrived at the airport for my flight quite early and my gate had not yet been announced when I got to the terminal, so I decided just to choose a random gate to sit at until I figured out where I was going. As I was sitting, I noticed a woman traveling alone who approached a seat just across from me with a purse and a duffel bag. All of a sudden, she left her duffel bag on the seat and immediately started walking away and didn't look back. I watched her speed walk all the way down the terminal until I couldn't see her anymore (she wasn't walking to the bathroom btw, because the bathroom was directly behind where I was sitting and she was walking away from it), and all that was running through my head was announcements that I've heard in airports in the past: ""... if you notice a bag or piece of luggage that has been left unattended, report it immediately.""

I walked up to the nearest gate attendent and explained to her what I just saw, and I expected her to let someone else know so they can investigate the bag. Instead, she explained to me that every piece of luggage that is in the terminal has been through security so it most likely wouldn't be a threat and that many people who don't have the means or don't want to pay for their baggage will just leave it behind at the airport.

I suppose it makes sense that if it has gone through security then it is most likely fine, but it still freaked me out and it doesn't completely make sense to me why someone would leave a bag like that and walk towards the terminal exit. I decided to sit at a different gate just in case my hunches were correct, and eventually departed on my plane. What do others think? Is this normal behavior or would you have been freaked out as well?",1053,233,1719181465.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dmy09y/saw_a_woman_traveling_alone_leave_her_duffel_bag/,_missea

Is the anti-tourism in Barcelona really that bad?,"I'm planning to go on a little trip with two of my girl friends in September. All 3 of us are from Europe and it's the first time we go on vacation together. 

We really wanted to go to a city in Europe and Barcelona seemed perfect for us. That was until we did further research and saw all the news about locals complaining about tourist, protesting and ""attacking"" tourists with water guns. That kinda put us of. 

We're not the kind of people to get really drunk and be loud in the streets late at night. But we don't wanna be somewhere, where we aren't welcome.
Or is this all mostly exaggerated by social media?

Some other cities we considered are:
- valencia
- Seville
- Rome
- Lisbon 
- Porto 

What we had in mind of doing in the city is: walking around (sightseeing), shopping, going to the beach or the park, visiting cultural monuments and maybe go out to a bar once

We're still very young and inexperienced, for my friends it's the first trip without parents (I already did a solo trip to Prague). We also know this trip is maybe quite ""last minute"", but it was also a spontaneous idea.

Violent theft in broad daylight in Barcelona ,"Hello Reddit community,

I am writing this post to share a horrifying experience that my family and I went through on our first day in Barcelona. There were 6 of us walking together when we had to split for a short bit due to a big van-like taxi parked on the street. At that point, my mom was in the corner of a street, with the street breaking into a small gully.

As my mom stood there for literally 5-10 seconds trying to notice the brand of the taxi, (note that this is my parents’ first time in Europe, so they want to notice everything!) a man started running towards her side. She initially thought he was just jogging, but as he got closer, he pushed her , snatched her gold chains and ran away. My mom was in shock and let out a loud scream. I turned back and saw my mom holding her neck and pointing towards the running man. I tried to follow him but couldn't catch up.

The incident took place on C/ de Sant Pere Més Baix, 62, Ciutat Vella, 08003 Barcelona, Spain, right opposite the Musik Boutique Hotel. When we spoke to the receptionist of the hotel about the incident (to understand if there is some cctv around), he told us that thefts like this are common in the area and that there is a gang operating in the vicinity.

My mom described the thief as around 180cm tall, with black curly hair, Caucasian skinned and aged between 22-28 years old. He had a lean but strong built. It is truly disheartening to see such criminal activities being normalized in a popular tourist destination like Barcelona.

We went to the police station to complain. In the 3 hours we were at the waiting area, we saw new families from various countries, individuals (single travelers and Spanish speaking people could be locals themselves), etc. come in and join the queue to speak to the translator / staff at the reception .. every 15-20 mins! Imagine the state at other police stations all over Barcelona!

This post is a heads-up for anyone planning to visit Barcelona - watch out, and stay safe. We won't be returning, and we'll make sure to warn everyone we know about this city.

What's even more absurd is the news about locals' use of water guns to deter tourists. Seriously, water guns? Such stories and experiences are enough to deter tourists.

Edit - To all those saying that my mom should have known: first, we are beating ourselves to this second to not have noticed what she was wearing or thinking hard about everything that could have gone wrong. And since this is someone’s first day in a European country and this person is old and not well travelled, I didn’t expect this person to be super aware and prepared. My parents hail from India and they have only looked up to Europe as a whole. But I agree that I should have been more prepared to get stolen from, mugged, check my pockets every minute, look at everyone with a suspicious eye, be paranoid about everyone around me scheming to pick pocket us, etc. Sadly enough, im not even being sarcastic!

Second, there were Spanish speaking people coming to the police station every 30-45 mins we were there apart from the international tourists. Some had their wallets stolen, entire bags or phones. So this is more than just “hey tourist, do you not know what you’re getting into?”. I hope people that live in the city don’t put all the responsibility on tourists to not wear gold chains or carry phones or wallets, but really tackle this!",385,272,1723314526.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1eozwos/violent_theft_in_broad_daylight_in_barcelona/,Difficult-Mulberry21
Boarding denied: Barcelona to Dublin,"Well, writing this from the BCN airport.

Had an early morning flight today to DUB from BCN by Vueling. Boarding was denied at gate claiming no valid documents to travel. It was a birthday vacation with wife (birthday tomorrow). 9 days were planned across Ireland starting today until Nov 3rd.

We hold Indian passports, reside in Barcelona with Spanish Residence Permit. Good travel history with over 30 countries across 4 continents, valid US, UK visas in addition to the Spanish residence permit.

We were travelling to Ireland under Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme (SSVWP) which allows Indian passport holders to visit Ireland without Irish visa if I have a valid short stay UK visa and I have entered UK in the last 180 days. Our exit from Ireland has to be either before UK visa expires or the UK entry permission of 180 days expires, whichever is the earlier. My UK visa is not issued in India, hence it's not a BIVS visa which gives entry to both UK and Ireland. But the Irish SSVWP is applicable for the UK visa I hold.

Coming to the current incident, flight was at 5:40 in the morning, we left our home at 1:00am, reached airport at 3:00am. Our boarding pass was issued, UK visa was verified, we checked in a bag and no drama while issuing the boarding pass. Fast forward to 5:00am while we were boarding, I unfortunately met one of the worst behavioured and unprofessional dumbass at boarding gate. She claimed that I need Irish Visa to travel to Dublin. I explained her the case, but she was very negligent and not interested to listen. She called her ""so called boss"" and asked if she can allow us and we are travelling with UK visa and apparently her boss said no. Meanwhile I kept telling her it's not just UK visa, but with entry stamp of UK within last 180 days. She never heard and just kept saying no. I even had the mail from Irish Embassy in Madrid stating that I can travel to Ireland. The rule exists in Irish govt website and IATA travel center website as well. She was just saying no to everything and was behaving as if she has the final say. I requested to talk to her boss to which she denied. She even rejected my request to give it in writing. She wasn't even listening to my case, she started shouting ""no""  in the very beginning if I even try to talk. I wasn't even sure on next steps or how to go back as I will have to cancel my exit immigration. I tried asking that, the moment I opened my mouth, she started shouting ""no, you need a visa."" She called the security and then we were escorted out of the boarding area, through immigration to the arrival area.

As it was early morning, no customer center was open. I went to the check-in counter and found a representative of Vueling, who looked like manager of the people who handle check-in. I explained him our case of denied boarding, he took us to a check-in counter where they called Dublin airport (I assume Irish immigration officials in Dublin airport) and explained the case. On receiving the confirmation that we can travel, he rebooked us on a flight later in the evening. He told us that he has entered the message in the system under our booking so that people at boarding gate will know our case.

Post this, we went back to the arrivals area where our checked-in bag was lying on the belt, collected it and came back to check-in the bag again in about 20mins. Guess what, repeat of same story. It was some other stupid employee in the check-in counter this time, rejected to check us in saying we need Irish visa. I explained her the story, we were just denied, it's your colleague who rebooked us just couple of minutes ago, he has entered the message in system against our booking, we are travelling with visa waiver, but all she was saying is that I need Irish visa. I lost the patience this time and just shouted at her to go home if you do not know the rules and are not interested in working. Thankfully found that person who rebooked my tickets, and he told her our case and we are checked-in now. 8 more hours to kill in the airport before the flight and I am still not confident that we will be allowed to board in the evening flight. He has told me that he will inform the necessary people and assured us that we will fly. Sitting at the airport, just with hopes as only the time will answer.

We had our train booked to Galway from Dublin today afternoon which we will miss, will have to figure out our last moment stay now in Dublin. I am skeptical of booking this even now as I am not confident that they will allow us to board in the evening.

All Vueling has given us is a rebooking on a flight 13hrs later, meal vouchers worth 40 euros per person. I would like to know from the travel community - what are the rights I have here and whom do I reach out for compensation? I have raised the compensation request with Vueling through the app already, but I definitely dont want to settle here for something small. In addition to the waste of train tickets, a night stay in Galway, I will have to book a last moment stay in Dublin and all the stress and harassment. Plus I lost a day of my trip.

TLDR; zero knowledge employee at boarding gate denied us from boarding the flight. We are at the receiving end, sleep deprived us, wasting time from 3am at airport and now waiting for the rebooked flight at 6:30pm in a hope that they will allow to board.


UPDATE: Boarded the evening flight, reached Dublin, cleared immigration in less than a minute, took the bus straight to Galway, reached our stay at 1am and straight away crashed on bed.

What once-popular tourist destinations are now largely forgotten or abandoned?,"# 

I'm curious about places that were major tourism hotspots in the past but have since fallen into obscurity or been largely abandoned.

Some examples that come to mind:

* **Bodie, California**: Once a booming gold rush town with 10,000 residents and countless visitors, now a preserved ghost town state park
* **Varosha, Cyprus**: Former Mediterranean resort that attracted celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor in the 1960s before becoming a ghost town after the 1974 Turkish invasion
* **Belle Isle Amusement Park in Detroit**: Early 20th century premier destination with 50,000+ daily summer visitors before closing in 1982
* **Hashima Island (Gunkanjima), Japan**: Industrial tourism site with record population density in the 1950s, abandoned in 1974 when coal mining ceased
* **Spreepark, Berlin**: East Germany's only amusement park that attracted 1.7 million visitors annually before closing in 2001

What other places have you encountered that were once overrun with tourists but are now largely forgotten? What caused their decline - geopolitical changes, economic shifts, environmental disasters, changing travel preferences?

Also curious if you think any of today's over-touristed destinations might experience a similar fate in the future! Maybe Lisbon or Barcelona?",2166,1101,1745790939.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k9fmq3/what_oncepopular_tourist_destinations_are_now/,FrozenOppressor

"Went to Ski in Grandvalira - Anodrra, and spent the weekend in Barcelona","We decided to visit Andorra to ski, and spent the weekend in Barcelona. We heard the skiing in Andorra was fantastic, so we decide why  not! Why not have an excuse to visit a new place right? The skiing was decent, we got 2 days of clear skies. Not everything was open, but I would say Andorra is a beginner/intermediates dream ski area. To get to Andorra is easy, there are busses all day long to the villages from the airport. We decided to stay in Pas de la Casa as it was more like a small town with things to do/eat/nightlife, but it was still very very limited. The ski resort is called Grandvalira, and you can ski from town to town.

We decided to spend a day down in the capital, which was only a short bus ride. The capital is known for its shopping, and this massive spa resort. We ate at some nice places, and the shopping was meh. We were able to walk through the capital twice in half a day while stopping at some shops, but there wasn't to many interesting things.  I would say its probably not worth the 3 hour bus ride from Barcelona if you weren't coming to do any mountain activities. I heard the mountain biking is fantastic.

We then spent the weekend in Barcelona, did the usual tourist things like eat at the market, and visit the Gaudi architecture.  The food was fantastic, and one thing I really recommend doing is join a bar crawl. We have done bar crawls all over the world now, and for around $20 its great. You get to meet new people, go to bars that you would have never found, and the $20 includes drinks/shots at each of the 4-5 bars/clubs you will visit.

Are Rome and Barcelona truly too busy (and hot) in July?,"Late 20s, Canadian couple. 

We have our honeymoon booked. Flying into Barcelona July 16, and home from Rome July 30. These are direct flights at least. We would spend a couple days in those respective cities, and then probably a bit of time in Girona and/or Amalfi coast, etc.

Are Barcelona, and even more so Rome going to be too crowded (and hot) this time of year? Especially due to Jubilee in Rome? 

We went to Paris in summer 2023 and found it to be totally fine. Same thing with Iceland last summer. 

Due to my partner being a teacher, it's summer, Christmas, or nothing. 

And even those cities are super crowded...it is the ones that have direct flights. ",30,117,1741660242.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1j8gk8m/are_rome_and_barcelona_truly_too_busy_and_hot_in/,arsenalastronaut

"trip started off great, then went downhill in Barcelona, and now I'm not sure what to do ","So I am currently in the last week of my month long trip. I started in Ireland solo where I had an absolutely incredible time. Then I met up with my dad in Germany and we explored Munich and Salzburg for a week, again, I had such a great time.

Last week, I traveled to Barcelona alone. On my second day, I got my phone and wallet stolen, which had all of my credit cards in it (I know I should have split up my cards and kept some back at the hostel, won't make that mistake ever again). I struggled to enjoy the remaining days I had in Barcelona and getting cash to spend was a hassle. At first I was just looking for Americans at the hostel I could Zelle for cash until my dad agreed to Western Union me whatever I needed.

Now, here's where I really messed up. The last leg of this trip was gonna be in Colombia to meet up with some buddies. I was so excited to not be traveling solo again, and knew that being without my phone and wallet would be much easier with them, and I could actually enjoy my time. A few months ago, I booked a separate booking from Barcelona to Madrid and then Madrid to Cartagena. Doing it separate was a few hundred bucks cheaper and I would have had 4 hours of layover, with no checked bags, which I thought would be plenty.

Flight to Madrid ended up being 4 hours late and I missed my connection to Cartagena. Talked to the reps and because I booked separately, there was nothing they could help me with - $900 gone just like that. Got my dad to book me a hotel by the Madrid Airport and I'm here now.

Now I'm really torn about what I should do. Booking a flight to Medellin tomorrow (where my friends will arrive on Tuesday), and booking a flight straight home tomorrow is roughly around the same price \~ $800. I really have been looking forward to this trip with my friends for a long time - I do still want to go. But over all the stress and wasted time and money I've experienced over the past few days, I also really just want to be in my bed at home cuddling with my dog.

I know I'm the only one that can actually know what is best for me here, but wanted to know if anyone has been in a similar position as me and could share some advice.

Update:

Just booked my flight to Medellin. Thanks for the encouraging comments that made me realize, don't let shitty things happening ruin the entire trip. When I think about it, I really won't have many opportunities to travel abroad with my friends in my life and I need to take advantage of these opportunities when I'm young. My dog, my family, and my shitty job, will all be waiting for me when I get home.

Lessons Learned:

1. ALWAYS be vigilant about possessions in busy tourist cities, especially in Barcelona and drinking. Never take more than one card, and a bit of cash out. Leave the iPhone locked up at the hostel/hotel when I am out at night, and use a cheap one for directions/calling etc.
2. Never book two separate flights for a connection, even if it's a few hundred dollars cheaper, unless I can get 12+ hours of layover. Always buy some type of flight insurance or refundable ticket for expensive international flights.
3. Get travel insurance.
4. Keeping a positive mindset. I was not mugged, or physically harmed, or injured in anyway. My mishaps cost me a shit ton of money and stress but learning and gaining experience is a part of traveling. The lessons aren't always sunshine and rainbows, but valuable nonetheless.

Update 2: 

Few things I wanted to add. The way I got robbed is after the club, myself and 8 other people from the hostel all went to go sit on the beach. None of us were piss drunk or anything but tipsy enough to not be on high alert. After sitting on the beach for a bit, I decided I wanted to jump in for a swim. No one else wanted to so i asked the group if they could watch my stuff while I went. A big mistake was asking the group in general, rather than a specific person. After being in the water for a few minutes, a couple others joined in, leaving like 3-4 on the beach with all our stuff. 

The people that didn't get robbed kept their valuables in their shoes. 2 people got stuff robbed out of their pockets (including me) and 2 purses were stolen. I wouldn't consider Barcelona a dangerous city really, mostly because a vast majority of thefts occur with 0 confrontation and violence. Theft is pretty common though if you are a young traveler, going to be out late, drinking, and dropping your vigilance. It's difficult to be on high alert at all times, even after a few drinks, so the best thing to do is keep anything you cannot lose back at your accommodation when going out at night. In the 6 days I was at the hostel, I heard of at least 10 people that got something valuable stolen from them outside the hostel. So, it's not super rare like some are suggesting - if you are apart of this young, being out late, and drinking demographic of tourists. 

Also shoutout to Wolter's World. Anytime I'm traveling and I'm homesick, not really feeling in the travel mood, or just overwhelmed, that mans videos never fails to comfort me and get me excited again.

Shops and restaurants scamming tourists in Barcelona? ,"I was in Barcelona last month with my SO, we stayed there for 6 days. I know that in some countries, tourists are  overcharged in shops, restaurants, etc, but I had never experienced this in Europe. In Barcelona, this happened to us on at least 4 occasions: 

1) We found a bar in the Gothic Quarter with a sign advertising 2 Aperol Spritz for 9 €. We thought it was a good price and went in. We had the drink, but when it was time to pay, the bill was 13 €. The waiter told us the advertised price was only valid until 6 pm, but we had entered the bar at 6:30 pm and they hadn't taken down the sign. Since the difference was small, we just let it go. 

2) Also in the Gothic Quarter, we went into a shop and bought 2 jamón ibéricos that were clearly marked as 10 euros each. Only after we had paid and left did I realize that the charge on the card was 30 and not 20 euros. 

3) At a small restaurant in Barceloneta, the total bill was 20% higher than the sum of the items ordered. I questioned the lady who served us, who seemed to be the owner, and she explained that there was an additional charge for sitting outside. I am aware that this kind of charge is common in Spain, but in this specific restaurant, there was no information about it anywhere (not on the menu or any sign). The restaurant only offered outdoor seating, so I find it a bit strange to charge extra for something that is the only option. 

4) At the Sagrada Familia gift shop he total for the items we bought was 42 €, but the cashier initially charged 59 €. We complained and he said that one of the items had been scanned twice by mistake and apologized. Ok, this one might have been a genuine mistake, but still annoying.

Anyway, we loved the city but felt that in Barcelona specifically you are more likely to fall for this kind of scam. It seems the city is filled with these tourist traps, something we did not experience in other Spanish cities we visited on the same trip. I just want to understand if this perception is correct or if we just had bad luck.",181,127,1717672071.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d9fkfz/shops_and_restaurants_scamming_tourists_in/,witz93
Share positive Barcelona experiences with me! PLEASE,"I’m about to leave for a trip to Barcelona, I’ll be staying in the city for over a week. I’m excited but every time I look up travel threads about Barcelona all I read is stories of people get robbed and pickpocketed. It is putting a damper on things and giving me cold feet. Literally every time I do research for my trip I feel like it’s all I see and read. Last night I even had dinner with two friends who recently traveled there, I was excited to hear their recommendations. Instead all I heard was how one of their phones was stolen and how the other one caught a pickpocket in the act! It’s driving me bonkers and making me sooooo anxious. 

So PLEASE - for my own sanity, I’d love to hear some positive travel stories. How many of you have traveled through Barcelona and been fine? Had fun? No run-ins with pickpockets? Would love to go back to the city? It’s my first time going and I want to feel excited.

I understand it is a real problem in the city. I am sensible and aware. I am bringing a money belt and bought a pac-safe bag for this trip. I bought a lanyard for my phone. I’m going to make myself a hard target. But I still have cold feet and can’t seem to look up Barcelona without finding a million stories of people’s unfortunate experiences.

"Bizarre - very personal additional ""security"" questions asked at Barcelona airport Delta check-in","A bit bothered by this and wondering if anyone has experienced the same thing.

I am flying from BCN to JFK on Delta. After doing self bag drop, the agent behind the desk directed me to two men by the counter for ""security questions"". I was confused but went over anyway. 

They scanned my passport again and asked the below questions:

""Where are you flying to?"" 
""How long have you been in Spain?"" 
""Are you here for tourism?"" 
""What did you do here?"" (not satisfied with my answer of eating, drinking, and sightseeing) - ""What specifically did you do?"" - ""Where did you go?"" - ""Why did you do these things?""
""How many times have you been to Spain and Barcelona?""
""Did you come here by yourself?"" 
""Are you in Spain by yourself?"" 
""What made you want to come here?""

I find the questions to be incredibly intrusive, as they would not be satisfied with vague answers and only moved on when I went into very detailed explanations like ""I was mostly in x and y neighborhoods in Barcelona and went to this and that place because I am interested in the architecture and art and food"" ""I am not here by myself because my partner is living here right now and I am visiting."" I also had to recount timing and number of my past visits. 

Some background - I am a US citizen. I have been to Spain for about ten times in the past two years, staying for no longer than a month. I have mostly entered the Schengen Area via airports outside of Spain. There is no history of criminal activities or immigration violations. 

I asked for the reason for this screening and it is required by whom, US government or Spanish government? And they simply said both, to make sure I am not doing anything bad (!?!??!). At the end of the day, I wonder if I could just refuse answering these. What would be their rights to do this? Who were those people? 

I wonder if this check is for every passenger out of Spain, or Barcelona, on Delta, to United States? Or random? Or they had some reasons to choose me specifically? 

Would love to hear from your experience and also give travelers a heads up. ",0,55,1750159895.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ldkq01/bizarre_very_personal_additional_security/,teehansa

"Booked apartment in Barcelona, just found out about previously undisclosed age limit","Hi all

I booked through a third party travel agent website which sells packaged flights and accommodation. 

I have just now had a look at the listing for the accommodation on the providers website, as they have more up to date photos of the apartment, and I have noticed under house rules that it says ‘only adults over 25 years old and/or families’

This was not listed on the travel agents website, and I have checked thoroughly. 

The booking process involved listing all of our ages, and nothing has been flagged so far, it’s all gone smoothly.

Barcelona & Girona Trip Report,"My wife and I just returned from Spain. Our itinerary is basically like: 2 days in Barcelona, 4 days in Santa Susanna (for business purpose), and 1 night in Girona.

First, I will probably never buy Go City pass again. It’s effective for 2 days, NOT 48 hours. Because of this misunderstanding, the 2 of us ended up paying over 70 euros for the Barcelona BusTurístic. And, from my understanding, Go City is a platform, and you will still need to book tickets for some of the tourist spots through various vendors. And even if you have booked the tickets, the vendors will cancel on you, which is the reason I wasn’t able to explore Park Guell.

Second part is transportation. From Santa Susanna to Girona, I took a Rodalies train headed to Figueres. The ticket machine didn’t work, so me and other tourists had to buy tickets from windows across the pathway, which was a bit annoying. And I was really surprised and confused because no one was checking our tickets and there wasn’t any kind of gates.

As a Chinese, I was surprised to find so many privately owned transportation companies. Public transportation in Barcelona was not cheap at all for us. Luckily we bought the T casual, which turned out to be very useful, and almost used all the 10 entrances. We were also grateful that our T casual ticket was applicable to the train to the airport. But I heard its price will rise in 2025 (?) Not good news.

We took a taxi once and a journey from mont juic to Sagrada Familia costs 18 euros. We also used Cabify once, and a 10 minute ride cost 10 euros. Pretty expensive, at least for us.

On our way back to Barcelona from Girona, we were lucky enough to get tickets from the window when the machines already stopped selling them. It took me a while to realize that AVANT belonged to Renfe and is a type of high speed train. I noticed that it ran at the speed of 200km/h. 

Thirdly, on where to go.

With Go City, we explored the Gothic Quarter and Sagrada Familia with 2 different guides. Both tours are bi-lingual, namely English and Spanish, so we had to wait when the guide was speaking Spanish. It seemed to me that the first guide spent much more time speaking Spanish, which is another reason I won’t buy Go City anymore - limited options! But of course if you can speak both languages, you can benefit a lot more from the tours. And the second guide was talking about how some angels on the façade were designed by a Japanese architect and because of that these angels have squinting eyes, blah blah, for quite a long time. Which I think is very racist.

Sagrada Familia and Casa de Batllo were definitely highlights of this trip. I had high hopes but still was shocked by how beautiful they were. Btw, I really liked the handhold phone-like audio guide with number buttons. One simply needs to tap the numbers and listen. I used this type of guides in Basilica de San Felix in Girona as well and found it really handy. Apart from its grandeur, Sagrada Familia’s construction timeline was also very interesting-next to it we saw a building with a banner that reads “our houses are legal”.

Girona is a lovely place for hiking and eating. We especially enjoyed walking in the old city and on the ancient wall when there were warm sunlights. But we did not enjoyed the urine and feces on the wall. We bought a combination ticket for Basilica de San Felix, Girona Cathedral and Girona Art museum, which were awe-inspiring architectural creations. 

At last, some random thoughts.

There was a guy on our train back to the airport who was leaving packed tissue paper on empty seats next to passengers. And after some time he came back to collect these paper. I wonder how much he is gonna charge if someone took one pack.

Btw, you should be mindful of the ground in Barcelona, because there was feces in an elevator leading to the Left Luggages in Sants Estacio -we were really grateful that we saw it.

I'm starting in Rome but from there we are looking to fly somewhere in Spain to spend 3-4 days there. Originally we wanted to try to cram 2 cities in Spain during this time but decided to just commit to one city.

I really enjoy very mainstream tourist attractions/cities so I wanted to go to Barcelona. However, I feel like just about everything I read on reddit and elsewhere says Barcelona is not that great and people prefer other places in Spain so now I'm at a loss.

Based on what I've read, it seems people overwhelmingly enjoy Seville. I've seen videos and pictures and I do agree it looks pretty.

Was hoping to get confirmation that I really should try to avoid Barcelona and opt for Seville? Overall, looking for somewhere with nice tourist attractions and really good food. Nightlife is a plus but not a requirement, we arent the type to party as hard as they do in Barcelona/Ibiza but I was interested in lightly checking out a club scene.

I'm also open to other recommendations, but preferably somewhere thats easy to fly to from Rome.

Need advice? Luggage stole in Barcelona with important meds,"I’m not sure what to do. My bad was stolen at the Barcelona airport today.  It was a large suitcase full of clothes for a longer trip and most importantly my wife’s medications.

I have no idea how to get her prescriptions refilled as our insurance has to do a prior approval to get it released early for this trip.  We have about 12 hours before we are supposed to leave Spain and I’m lost.

I’ve filed police reports, a report with the airline.  My luggage had an AirTag in it and I went to the location where it shows it and its residential apartment buildings. The police don’t seem to care at all.

 I also have no clue where to find plus size clothing for men and women here since about 2 weeks of clothes were in the suitcase and we are bigger people.

Got a fine in Barcelona because my friend wasn’t wearing a helmet – can I be held responsible?,"Hey everyone, and I hope I did not choose the wrong sub for such question but I need some advice on a situation that happened recently in Barcelona.

I rented a scooter while visiting the city and was riding with a friend who accepted the fact that I only had one helmet. I was the driver and I was wearing a helmet, but my friend (the passenger) wasn’t. We got stopped by the police, and my friend got a €200 fine for not wearing it.

Here’s the issue: the license plate number of the rental scooter (which was under my name) is written on the fine. Now my friend is acting like he might just not pay it, and I’m worried the fine might come back to me. Could the authorities contact the rental company, and then the company charge me instead, since I was the one who signed the rental contract?

Has anyone experienced something similar in Spain or elsewhere in Europe? How do these things usually play out?
Thanks in advance!

Is There Another City That Feels Like Prague?,"I traveled to Europe a long time ago, and I really enjoyed Prague. On the other hand,  I didn't personally connect with Paris. Sorry to Parisians.

I’ve been searching online and looking at photos of cities like Vienna, Milan, Florence, Barcelona, Munich, Warsaw, etc. But none of them seem to have the same atmosphere as Prague.

I think there’s something special about Prague—maybe its architecture or the layout of the old town—but I can't describe exactly what it is.

Renting a bike in the Netherlands and returning it in Barcelona?,"Heya!
I kinda have a weird question,
Me and a few friends are planning to go to Barcelona by electric bike from the Netherlands this summer. 


but the only problem would be the way back home, because we don’t want to cycle 2000+ km back to the Netherlands. 
And all the other options for the way back are very complicated if we need to take an electric bike with us.

So we were wondering, is it possible somewhere or somehow for us to rent a bike in the Netherlands and return it in Barcelona (or another city within like 300 km)

We wouldn’t mind paying extra. And if anything would break on the way there we would get it fixed, and if for some reason the bike wouldn’t work anymore at all we would make sure the bike would get back home.

Or does someone maybe have an better idea? 

Thanks in advance for any tips 😊

"After hours of research, I need some help understanding Madrid Versus Barcelona","I am a 32F from the US going to travel to Spain in February. There were some change of plans from my earlier post, but I am also going to places you all have suggested before Spain. 

That said, I’ve spent hours looking at how each city is laid out by district and neighborhoods, site seeing and more. I understand it all but I found this puzzling: it is commonly suggested to spend more time in Madrid than Barcelona. I am aware Madrid is MUCH bigger (21 districts and 131 neighborhoods is massive), but it seems that Barcelona has that whimsical (Gaudi) experience, arguably more touristic… 

That said, do you all feel I should really spend 2-3 days in Barcelona and 3-4 in Madrid? I have 7 total days. I enjoy museums, architecture, and great food (I know you can’t go wrong in these cities for that.

TLDR: should I really spend less time in Barcelona than in Madrid?

March 2025 - London + Edinburgh + Paris (+ Barcelona?) 16 days. Help me solve a complex problem.,"We are going to London to see a single (special) West End show in early March. We were originally just going to go for a long weekend, but then I thought ""Why not extend the trip to go to Edinburgh?"" since we've both never been.

Then my partner said, ""I'd like to go to Paris too."" And I said ""That's ok with me.""

And then I thought, ""While we're at it, we might as well try to squeeze Barcelona in there too."" Since it's also on our wish list of places to go as well.

So now it turned into a complex problem that I'm trying to figure out lol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luckily, we are decently flexible on the number of days we can travel, probably up to 16 days. So, I'm trying to balance out the itinerary with as many spots as possible, without going overboard and making the trip too hectic. My fundamental question is, what is too much?

We've been to both London and Paris before so we probably don't need to max out the time there.

What's the optimal number of days to spend in each place? Since we've been to London and Paris before, we probably don't need to spend a full itineraries' worth of time in there. It also doesn't seem like you need to spend more than a couple of days in Edinburgh.

So far, the rough itinerary i've come up with is this:

1. Fly in: 1 Day
1. London: 4 days
1. Edinburgh: 3 days
1. Paris: 4 days
1. Barcelona? 3 days?
1. Fly out: 1 day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we do include all the locations, what is the most efficient order to visit these places? Since there are no nonstop flights to or out of Edinburgh from our home, it seems like we'll need to:

1. Fly into London
1. Take the train to Edinburgh
1. Fly from Edinburgh to Paris
1. Fly from Paris to Barcelona
1. Fly from Barcelona back home.




Any advice is appreciated. How should I think about this?",10,38,1734824626.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hjmaj2/march_2025_london_edinburgh_paris_barcelona_16/,aghowl
10 Days Solo Trip mid-November -- Nice/Barcelona,"Hi!

I am planning a 10-day trip to two places I've been rarin' to go -- Nice, and Barcelona. I haven't been to both, but have been to EU before. It's a solo trip this mid November, I want this trip to be more relaxing, laid back ie Nice, however I also didnt want to miss out on Barcelona since it's not that far away (and it's not cheap going from where I from -- Asia)

1. 10 Days in Nice -- would this be too long for this area? Especially on cold weather days? Looking to do some hikes if I go this route but Im afraid not a lot of options.

2. 5 Days Barcelona / 5 Days Nice  - if I opt for this, would it be better land in BCN first, then the 2nd leg is Nice? Thinking of flying instead of trains.

Beware of pickpockets!,"We’ve been to Europe a bunch of times, and never had any problems - and I guess we got lax.  Two weeks ago, my wife, kids, and I are walking to our rental in the gothic quarter of Barcelona - at about 10:30 at night.  The streets were lively and we felt safe.  

My wife had put her cell phone in the side pocket of a small backpack she was wearing.  At an intersection, as the light turns green for us to cross, she says to me, “someone just took my phone!”  

After confirming that she was sure - she then proceeded to point out the two guys that she thought were responsible.   I approached them (they were walking the same direction I was) and asked them for my wife’s phone back.  They mumbled something, refused to make eye contact, and kept walking.  I opened the find my phone app on my phone and could clearly see they were in possession of the phone.  

I kept up the chase for about a block, imploring them to just give me the phone back.  I told them repeatedly that I could see that they had it.  Finally, I yelled “policia!” One guy turned around and handed me the phone.  As I walked away his buddy threw a drink at me (but missed) and the thief himself spit at me (and also missed).

I felt both stupid and heroic.  My wife was happy to have her phone back.  We learned our lesson - keep valuables close at hand and in places that can’t easily be reached.

Did we get screwed over by our hotel in Barcelona?,"We did a tour in Spain with additional hotel stays, our Madrid hotel experience was flawless, they provided a lot of services for us for no extra charge like getting us tickets to museums, but in Barcelona we felt we were getting constantly screwed over. They charged us a tax first thing, which I guess is a thing there, they also charged us to hold our luggage since we got to the room too early. We didn't have any of these charges in Madrid.

The biggest one is we asked the hotel to call a taxi because we couldn't see any outside the hotel. Everyone told us we could do this so we assumed it was not a problem. We told the front desk to schedule a taxi to the airport 30 minutes from now so we could go up and finish packing. When we arrived at the airport the price was really high, like double or more what it should have been for a 20 min trip. Turns out the front desk didn't schedule the taxi in 30 minutes, but told the taxi to be there right away, so we got charged for 30 minutes of waiting. The taxi driver also told us there was a fee from the hotel for calling the taxi, which they didn't tell us about. We couldn't really do anything to dispute the bill so we just paid and left.

Is this a normal thing that we just weren't aware of? Or was the hotel screwing us over?

I've waited my entire life for this - please advise,"Hi all!  I'm 40, a single father, my son joined the Army making me an empty nester.  I resigned from my job a couple of months ago, and I am 30-45 days away from being able to cut away and disappear for a while.

I plan to not have much of a plan - I want to take a suitcase, my golf clubs and a passport and just... go for a while.  I've budgeted $100k for a year of travel and intend to see the world until I get bored or run out of money, whichever comes first.

I have never taken a true vacation before; the reality of what I'm about to do (and my lack of experience) is settling on me. What am I not thinking of that could make this go poorly? What \*should\* be planned? Is bringing my golf clubs dumb?

In my brain I envision something like this:  Go to SE Asia first, Vietnam and Thailand I'd like to visit.  I don't know how long I'll stay, but I'm confident I can find a place to stay that's decent and stretches my budget. From there, I really want to learn how to scuba dive in New Zealand and see Poor Knights(edit).  I've never been to Europe so if after those two stops I'm still hungry for more I figure I'll just start in Portugal and work my way up to Berlin for what I hear is a great place to go dancing.

I'm not married to any ideas. I love EDM, I want to go dance and see the world and have fun for a while with no responsibilities or obligations - meet new people, figure out who the hell I am, y'know that kind of stuff.

I've fantasized about this moment for a very long time. I am equally excited and terrified. If you were in my shoes, what kinds of things are you doing to ensure this year goes smoothly?

EDIT:  Golf clubs are out, I was on the fence there thanks all lol

EDIT2: Thank you everyone for the advice!  I did go to REI to try on a backpack and got overwhelmed. They put a bunch of weights in a 65+10 Osprey and it was worse than any rucksack I ever carried lol. I'm thinking a large duffel bag with backstraps is probably cool, and I'll just adapt on the fly for things I need.

Europe first vs. SEA first, I'm not sure. I'll think on this as I get my house ready for rent. Europe feels like a budget sink and that's why I wanted to leave it for last; I didn't think I would have trouble with language or culture in SEA. These are the reasons I chose SEA as the starting point (plus proximity to NZ. I visited Sydney when I was in the Army, but I owe Melbourne it's due yet)

Figure out my phone plan ahead of time (I was just gonna roam and keep my AT&T plan). 

I will definitely get my 'jabs' (new slang lfg), my passport is good for many years, I'll find some good travel insurance (never heard of or considered this, thanks all), Barcelona > Berlin for my dance vibe ;)

\*Leave Friday and arrive Saturday in Malaga (3 hour connection in LHR London, different airlines)

\*Sunday afternoon train to Granada

\*Monday and Tuesday Granada  

\*Wednesday morning train to Cordoba, evening train to Seville (?)  or better to spend the night, where would we store luggage with a day trip?

\*Thursday Friday Seville

\*Saturday train to Madrid

\*Sunday morning flight out of Madrid

\-----------------------------------

Would love an opinions on the above!  While I would love to visit Andalusia, I am a bit concerned about the logistics and feeling rushed with that itinerary.  I would kind of hate to miss Granada if we are in Seville, but we could also do a split of Madrid and Seville to keep it more simple and at least see some of Andalusia.  We would have to come back for Granada.

We are coming from the West Coast USA, so there is a significant time change to deal with.

Tips to avoid theft in Barcelona? ,"I'm going to spend five days in Barcelona and am doing my due diligence in plenty of 'research' online beforehand. 

So.. it seems like theft as in pickpocketing/purses being grabbed while out on the town is pretty rampant.

I'm assuming leave passports/super important stuff at the hotel and hidden in luggage vs. in clear sight. But for when I'm actively sightseeing, is having cash, my credit card and phone in a clutch that I'm basically always holding onto 'safe' by Barcelona's standards?

Any tips/warnings are welcome!

Barcelona experiences,"My husband and I are doing a Euro trip in August. We’ll be in Barcelona for 3 days and I really want to see a flamenco show. I’ve been to one before in Seville last year but it will be hubby’s first time in Spain and I want him to see one too. I already know that Barcelona isn’t known for Flamenco but we are not traveling to Andalucía this time and we’ll have to make do with the options in Barcelona.

I wanted to know if anyone had any recommendations for Flamenco shows. I’ve been looking at:

-Flamenco Barcelona SL (City theater)
- Official Casa Sors
- Los Tarantos
- Tabloa de Carmen
- Tablao Flamenco Cordobes

We’re really just looking for the best show; we don’t care about food/drinks as we can eat elsewhere.

Also if there’s another entertainment experience in Barcelona that you think is better, we are open to looking at something else. TIY .

Barcelona/Madrid,"My husband and I are traveling with my parents to Madrid and Barcelona in October. Looking for tips/recommendations on what we should do! Especially which spots we should prioritize and any restaurant recommendations. 

We will only be there about 9 days so splitting the time between the 2 main cities. It’s mine and my family’s first time but my husband has been and loves it. 

We are wanting to do a day trip to Avila/Segovia and/or Toledo. Want to try and see a flamenco show if there’s are recommendations on which one. We don’t care for shopping but love the history/architectural sights, especially cathedrals, but don’t necessarily need to go in everywhere so wondering what people feel is more worth it.

9 days in Barcelona or 3 days in Paris + 6 days in Barcelona?,"Hey everyone, first time poster here. I have done solo trips to both Thailand (3 weeks) and Japan (2 weeks), and had a bunch of fun in both. I love staying in areas with tons of nightlife (I stayed in Shinjuku in Japan and Silom in Bangkok), so was originally planning on staying 3 days in Amsterdam, catching a flight to Barcelona for 9 days. Planning on doing some Jiu-Jitsu every morning in Barcelona and just walking around until nighttime hits at which I'll hit the nightlife scene. However, because all of my accommodation (except for Amsterdam) is currently refundable, I've thought about possibly taking 3 days in Amsterdam, taking a train down to Paris for 3 days, then taking another train down to Barcelona for 6 days.

Flying through Amsterdam to Barcelona with short layover,"Hoping to make the most of my short 4.5h layover by walking through the sequence of events here and seeing if I'm missing anything. Thanks for any advice!

Coming from Canada and will arrive in Schiphol airport (mid morning, mid week). I will only have carry on. 
1. Arrive in one of the non Schengen gates. 
2. Go through security and passport control. I'm flying business class and I hear there is a priority lane? Can anyone confirm?
3. Once I'm in Schengen area of airport, I can just leave to go on the train bound for Amsterdam Centraal station, right? 
4. I believe the train is pretty frequent, and is about 20 min.

I'll spend about an hour downtown. Just to see the canals, get a couple souvenirs for the kids. Hopefully my Jetpac eSIM will actually work. Then back to airport for flight to Spain.
1. Take train from Centraal to airport. 
2. I'll have electrically checked in already.
3. I have a security appointment for a bit over and hour before departure. 
4. Otherwise, is there a priority lane and can business class passengers use it? In general does Nexus matter in the EU? 
5. Go through security, get to gate in Schengen area of airport. 
6. Depart.

Any thoughts? Am I crazy to try to leave the airport? My alternative is to sit in the lounge but I hear they're kinda crowded anyway.

EDIT: Thanks all for the advice and reality checks! I'll stay in the airport and hang out. Bad news: my flight back home on Saturday has only a 1hr connection at Schiphol, going from Schengen to non Schengen. No idea why the travel agent booked such a tight connection.

22/23 year old group of lads (6 of us) are going for a city break in late feb / early march.

First things first, we plan on going in either late feb / early march. so while barcelona might not be boiling, it'll be a nice change from the cold weather in the uk.

We love drinking - so nightlife is important to us...

During the day, we want a good mix of sightseeing, nice places to get food, and also some fun activities too!

Price isn't TOO big of an issue, since we're only going for a few days, and aren't hugely limited budget wise.

We fancy the idea of maybe going to a football game (Barcelona might be a stretch, since they're a huge club and tickets would be sparse). However, it's not an essential.

Valencia vs Barcelona from 7 to 12 August,"Hi all! My girlfriend and I (both 23) are planning a trip to Spain from August 7–12, 2025, and we're torn between **Valencia** and **Barcelona**. Flights + hotel cost about the same (\~€1.1k), so budget isn’t a factor.

**Our priorities:**

* Beach: Just 1–1.5 days max
* First time in Spain
* Pace: Active, but relaxed enough to fully enjoy without feeling exhausted, as we rarely travel abroad (1-2 times per year max).

**Our thoughts so far:**

* **Barcelona**: Big city, lots to see, 4–5 days seems ideal. But August might be crowded and very hot.
* **Valencia**: Quieter and more laid-back, but most people say 3–4 days is enough. We’re not sure how to fill 5 days unless we plan day trips.

So, would you pick **Valencia**, knowing we may need to organize outside excursions, or **Barcelona**, which has plenty to offer but comes with tourist crowds and heat?

Barcelona to Narbonne - Bus vs Train,"Looking for travel advice. I’m planning a trip with myself & sister (20s) plus my grandmother (70s). She is relatively adventurous and no major mobility issues.

We are flying into Barcelona and staying in Narbonne, FR for a week. We originally planned to take a train but the cost seems quite high compared to bus (over 500 euro for 3 with discount cards).

I’m pretty familiar with trains in the region and expect it to be quite busy for the late August timeline we are planning. 

Any experience with BlaBlaCar or Flixbus? I assume the train is worth the splurge but my previous experiences didn’t feel like it justifies the 3X price tag.

I’m not particularly budget minded for the trip but felt a bit of sticker shock as Ouigo does not run this line.

Edit: I have done the math with the 50 euro age discount cards for 30% off. Unfortunately it saves only like 10 euros unless you are booking a ton of train rides.

Barcelona Hotel(s) over New Years,"Planning on a trip to Barcelona for New Years...

Trying to figure out the best place to stay. Sounds like Gothic Quarter is too touristy and the restaurants aren't great. Seems like the area above either Eixample or Gracia further north... I'm a huge foodie so prefer to not eat at tourist traps and we like to walk to most places so I'm thinking around the Eixample area..

Right now looking at a few choices :

NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel Calderon - Seems to be very central if I'm not mistaken? Says its a 5\* hotel although by the pictures, I can't say it seems like it is.

Hotel Condes de Barcelona - Also seems like a nice hotel but I'm wondering if its too far north to walk to most places?

Hotel Barcelona Center - Same as above but slightly cheaper

Also a few H10 hotels (Metropolitan / Cubik / Urquinaona Plaza) - These seem like they might be a bit too south and close to the tourist traps.

In May, went to Salzburg (4/13) for a day trip. I currently live in Munich so it's a short train ride from there, about 2hrs. In June, I spent two weeks in Italy: flew from Munich to Naples (stayed 3 days), then Rome (4 days), Florence (5/13; 3 days), and Venice (2 days).

Throughout the Summer, went to the Greek island of Zakynthos (6/13) for about 4 days and also visited some places across Germany (7/13; Schloss Neuschwanstein in the image). In September, spent a weekend in Liechtenstein (8/13) and, from there, went to St. Gallen, Switzerland (9/13).

In October flew from Munich to Barcelona (10/13) and, while there, took a train to Girona (4 days in total). After that, flew to the Azores - São Miguel (11/13) and Terceira Islands (5 days in total). 

To wrap up the year, flew from Munich to Luxembourg (12/13) earlier this month, spent over 1,5 days there, and then took a train to Belgium, where I visited Ghent (13/13), Bruges, Antwerp and Brussels for about a week.",3453,64,1735598236.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpzl9p,rubesf9

Looking for feedback on my 1 week Barcelona & Portugal Itinerary,"Hello, I am currently planning a 15 day itinerary for 1 week in Barcelona and 1 week in Portugal and I was looking for feedback. One thing on my mind is while Barcelona is huge I feel like most of my trip is condensed into one area so I was wondering if there is any feedback that regard.  
  
**1st full day:**   
To anticipate jetlag I made this day a bit more straightforward and simple which is walking down la rambla, going to la boqueria and seeing Casa Batllo, Casa Mila and Casa Vincens in a straight line with only getting tickets for Casa Battlo, get vermouth somewhere on the way to parc turo where we relax and people watch. 

Then find somewhere close for dinner and walk around Sants where the hotel is. 

**2nd day:**   
Take a train to Figueres to see the Dali Museum, then ride the train down to Girona, get lunch and explore some churches like Sant Pere de Galligants, Girona Cathedral and other points of interest. Get dinner back in Barcelona

**3rd Day: (sunday)**

Get Xurros for breakfast, visit Palau de la Música Catalana, go to mercat del born and then visit the Cathedral of Barcelona and explore the gothic quarter. After 3pm go to Montjuic Castle for free admission and also check out the Olympic Pool.

**4th Day:** 

Get the full package for Montserrat, do some light hiking + see the Black Madonna. 

**5th Day:** 

Sagrada Familia in the morning for the Nativity lighting, was planning on doing the guided tour + tower visit even though I heard the tower is sometimes underwhelming.  Then, go to Recinte Modernista de Sant Pau and slowly make our way up to Parc Guell for a late picnic. 

**6th Day:** 

Go down to Tarragona and see the roman monuments and other points of interest, get lunch and then take a train up to Sitges to do more walking and possibly dinner. 

**7th Day: (last full day in Barcelona)** 

This will be our wind down day as we prepare to go to Porto, see the Picasso Museum and explore some other points we missed like Arc de Triomf and stop by Mercat de Sant Antoni. Very slowed down day where we might go souvenir shopping. Nothing heavily planned for this day.

What cities are deceivingly cheap or expensive?,"For example, London and Washington are considered expensive cities to visit. But a family of 4 can visit museums for free over the course of a week that would cost them $500 in entry fees in other cities.

Meanwhile “cheap” cities like Istanbul now charge $30-50 for each of their Top 10 landmarks, so visiting Basilica Cistern, Galata Tower, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi in just one day is going to cost $150 per person.

Barcelona is also considered a “cheap city” because food and walking around is cheap, but hotels seem very pricey and every attraction was a $$$ pit. Even smaller places that took only an hour or so: €25 for Casa Mila, €35 for Casa Batllo, etc.

"Barcelona , Nice , Cinque Terre, Florence, Rome Itinerary","Hey all, looking for some help putting together a  trip this summer.

Flying into Barcelona June 28th

Barcelona June 28-July 2nd

Nice/Southern France July 2nd - 5th

Cinque Terre July 5th-8th

Florence July 8th-11th

Rome July 11-13th

My wife and I would prefer to do all this via trains. The train from Barcelona to Nice is 8.5 hours so we’re not against doing half the leg and staying one night in a different city before making it to Nice. Any suggestions on this?

We know 2 nights is not a lot in Rome but we’ve been here before and it’s more of a convenient place to end with an international airport to get us back into the U.S. 

These dates can also change depending on feedback. We’re interested in mainly hitting the highlights of each city along the way , having food food and maybe having a slow day or 2 on a beach.

"9 day trip through Barcelona, Porto and Lisbon Itinerary","Thanks to reddit-induced anxiety I've swapped itineraries around a bit. Currently sticking to mainly Portugal with some brief time in Barcelona this March. 
How does this look so far?

My main uncertainty currently is the 12th/13th, hoping to include Coimbra and sacrificing a little time in Porto/Lisbon to do so. 
There are so many amazing sites to consider and it's been difficult saying no to things (such as Madeira Island).

Land in Barcelona 1pm Saturday March 8th.
8th: Mercado, Tapas, Gothic Quarter/Gaudi Cathedral

9th: 1/2 day trip to Montesserat, Gothic Quarter/Gaudi
we aren't inclined to go to museums or buy tourist sight-seeing tickets etc. just happy to be in the city, walk around, see beautiful things and eat good food.


Land in Porto 2pm Monday March 10th.
(wanting to be in Porto during the week, hoping it's less touristy than the late week/weekend?)
10th: settle in, walk along the river front, Livraria Lello if possible, Sunset view, Pastel de Nata + dinner

11th: Duoro Valley (I don't drink alcohol however would still like to see!)

12th: Livraria Lello if missed, head to Coimbra to see the University Library (thermal baths if possible)Stay in Coimbra? Porto? Head to Lisbon after?


13th: Depart from Porto or Coimbra to Lisbon if not there already. Check out LX Factory, viewpoint or walk around, dinner

14th: Sintra: not intersted in going into Pena Palace but wouldn't mind the beautiful hike up there, I heard the Moorish castles are very nice to see
Happy to skip/see Pena Palace from a distance and head to other spots

15th: Alfama neighborhood, check various viewpoints, dinner, evening jazz

16th: head back to Barcelona, relax, beach? gift shopping, dinner before flight

17th: flight at 11:30am from Barcelona to the States


EDIT: to add that we are doing Barcelona because we booked flights in/out of Barcelona. It wasn’t thought out well because going was an impulse decision to begin with (not sure if you’re interested to know that long story). 
One of the people traveling in our group has a lifelong wish of going to Lisbon and it gradually turned into a Portugal trip from that point. 
So yes, in hindsight, it would have been wiser to fly in/out of Portugal however the flights are non-refundable. It’s an inconvenient situation but I’d like to make the most of it.

I have already visited the “main 6” destinations in mainland Spain - Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla, Granada and Malaga. So I am looking to visit a new city/cities in mainland Spain.

- Great architecture, buildings and beautiful streets with bust cafés bars and restaurants

- Tasty local cuisine and good restaurants/tapas at affordable prices

- Really good nightlife with busy pubs, bars and clubs and lots of students

Why is Barcelona so elevated on the European stage?,"Visited last summer, hit all the major spots (Gaudi + museums + montjuic etc etc etc), went to the beach, tried tapas, popped into random markets and squares, wandered around - yet there was a distinctive lack of “wow” factor that I felt in every other European city I have visited. For one thing, the streets weren’t nearly as “charming” as I thought they would be. In fact, a lot of the city seemed very monotonous and lackluster. Also, I seriously fail to understand the hype around tapas. Maybe I didn’t have them correctly…I’d love to be proven wrong. 

Had some poor experiences with locals as well - was met with rudeness at a cafe when I started speaking in English, and even more rudeness after I made an attempt to speak Spanish…tbh felt like I was being mocked. 

Barcelona, as a whole, didn’t leave a lasting impression on me, unlike every other city I visited. 


What was I missing? Why is Barcelona so hyped up? Is it more of a “stop along the way” for an overall Spain trip? Or is it seriously worth it as a standalone?

I’m wondering if other parts of Spain are worth visiting - how does Barcelona compare to Madrid, Seville, Valencia, etc?",5,56,1707358164.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1alkj8g/why_is_barcelona_so_elevated_on_the_european_stage/,Confident_Kitchen555

Booking hotel for small family in Barcelona- what am I missing! ,"Hi, I’m looking for hotels in Barcelona for this December for 2 adults and a 10 year old child. Excepting a few hotels, most do not allow me to book a single room for the three of us. They all say book two rooms. This is on booking.com. Went to many hotel websites and checked, this is the case. Called a few hotels, they also say rooms only allow two guests so I have to book two rooms. Who takes two rooms for a family of 3?? Why not just charge extra for the child and be done with it? Have travelled a fair amount (but first time in Spain) and used booking.com mostly. This is the first time that the majority of hotels have this 2 persons to a room limit. I have like maybe 1-2 hotels in the desired area and budget that allow 3 in a room. Wanted to check if I’m missing anything before I go ahead and book from these limited choices.

Day 1-2 : Barcelona
Day 3: Montserrat Day trip
Day 4-6:  Pyrenees - Vall De Boi? 
Day 7: Back to Barcelona
Day 8: catch a morning flight back 

Would like to ask if the weather is suitable for hiking at the Pyrenees? And are there any other recommendations besides Vall De Boi? It would be great if the places are near Barcelona and easily accessible. 

Currently, with the limited information online about Vall De Boi, we are not very sure which town we should stay at and what else is there to do other than visiting the churches and the mountains.

1 week Spain Trip - How many days split between Barcelona and Mallorca?,"My wife and I are going to Spain at the end of May and trying to decide how many days we should split our time in Barcelona and Mallorca. We're thinking either 3 nights in each or 2 nights in Barcelona and 4 nights in Mallorca. It's only a week because we are saving more time off and money/points for a trip to Greece for a family wedding later in September. 

Option 1

* Day 1 - land in Barcelona 9:00 AM (overnight flight)
* Day 2 - Barcelona
* Day 3 - Barcelona
* Day 4 - Fly to Mallorca
* Day 5 - Mallorca
* Day 6 - Mallorca
* Day 7 - Fly home

* Day 2 - Barcelona
* Day 3 - Fly to Mallorca
* Day 4 - Mallorca
* Day 5 - Mallorca
* Day 6 - Mallorca
* Day 7 - Fly home

For Mallorca, we want to see some site but mainly relax on the beaches and resort.

We have some points so we plan to stay at the Grand Hyatt Barcelona and the Kimpton Aysla Mallorca.

Additionally, I read mixed things on whether you should or shouldn't rent a car in Mallorca.

Barcelona to Montserrat day trip - your advice on planning and ticketing?,"Hi all,

I'm visiting Montserrat from Barcelona with my mother on Wednesday 9 April and I would really appreciate and benefit from some help planning for the day. So thank you in advance.

For context, we are travelling there on our own by public transport (R5 line and cable car). We plan to visit the Montserrat Monastery (not watching Boy's choir), museum, have lunch, and take the funiculars up/down for the views.

So far, I have seen multiple people suggesting the Trans Montserrat Card/ToT Montserrat Card and we are planning to get the Trans card to cover all core transport and entry to the Monasterry. However, it also says on Barcelona's Turisme's website, that *access to the Black Madonna and basilica is included, no pre-booking required but ticket holders must queue for entry*.

My question here is:

1. As no pre-booking is required, is entry still guaranteed and we can do it anytime of the day? How long should we expect the wait to be?
2. Approximately how long would it take to visit the whole the Monastery, if we are not queuing to see the Black Madonna?
3. Is the Museum worth seeing?
4. . Aware that there will be a lot of groups and tours, what's the best way to plan for the day to avoid the crowd? Should we start with the funiculars and get the views early then visit the Monasterry after 2:30/3:00pm assuming it will be a little less crowded as the groups start to leave?
5. Finally, do you have any suggestions of decent restaurants/coffee shops at Montserrat?

Morocco vs Istanbul Vs Other Destinations near Barcelona for gay (MM) Travelers,"I am a gay American male debating on a trip to Barcelona this year with my partner. From Barcelona we are also debating on going to either Morocco or Istanbul. I'm aware that Morocco is not open to the lgbt lifestyle so the obvious no public PDA & being openly gay in public are the basic tips that i've seen people bring up.

  
Our other option is to visit Istanbul instead which to my understanding might be more open to the lgbt lifestyle than Morocco so i'm not too concerned ( Correct me if im wrong ).

  
My partner really wants to visit Morocco as he thinks as long as we are careful we will be fine so my biggest dilemma is deciding on whether to consider it or not. But is it worth going through all of that precaution into the unknown ?

  
My biggest concern is comfort & safety. We would be sharing a hotel room , are regularly lowkey  as far as how we present ourselves - so most times we can pass as being straight if that makes sense, & are not ones to show public affection anyway.

Am I being too dramatic? Should we take the chance & just go to visit Morocco or take the safe route & save that trip for another time in the future & just go to a more lgbt friendly destination instead...

(Also it doesn't say STUDENT ID on the card) The card always worked in my home country, however.

Would it be better to get my high school ID issued before I travel to Spain or get at least the online version of ISIC the card? Or will showing my current student profile on my school website work?

**What I like:** I am more into meeting kind people, great taps, good drinks, beautiful alleys, old architecture, romance for the wife, hole in the walls, hidden gems, a nightlife of bars and plazas, open late with a good crowd, flamenco, shows. 

**Not interested in:** I am not particularly interested in seeing too many churches, or going clubbing. I saw a lot of churches in Italy and other parts of Europe.

Traveling is not the same experience for women as it for men and it's insane what women face around the world,"Anyone who thinks traveling (or just traveling and honestly just existing) for women isn't hard - I urge you to think about the millions of women who face harassment. I myself have been either sexually assaulted, harassed, groped, catcalled heavily or followed in: Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Waterloo, London, Lisbon, Rome, and Naples. I was recently assaulted in Naples and posted about it to let people (esp women) know what can happen and instead I received messages from tons of men telling me I'm ""playing a sad victim"" and that I'm crying about it (I was literally hugged, groped, and kissed today by a total stranger on the street while walking)

It's not easy being a woman and still enjoying things worry free like men can and it sucks we've created a culture and a world where this is prevalent. I'm not saying men don't have to be worried about solo travelling, but women have to be worried about everything men do AND assault on top of that. It's to the point where I can't even go out at night when I have paid to travel to cities, or go to famous landmarks, or bars/clubs, or even take public transport at night. 

On top of that, things like pepper spray and such are illegal in so many countries and harming the other person (as self defence) may even result in the woman being punished if the law deems so. But we need to understand that women cannot defend themselves like men can in situations such as being attacked. We are simply not that strong physically. I know for a fact that I and many other women cannot get a man off us if we tried to. So why are we expecting the same ""self defense"" efforts from men and women? Knowing that using a pepper spray will get me in trouble with the law but the man who raped me can walk away if proven innocent blows my mind. 

I'm tired of following endless precautions yet still being targeted for things like this and assaulted. People are always blaming women too like ""oh you must've dressed wrong"" or ""you must have smiled at him"" and if not blaming women, people will only be giving tips out on what women can do to make sure that they are not assaulted. But WHY are we pinning everything on women and making it their responsibility? Why can't we teach guys that this is not okay by having stringent laws and punishments and just realizing the human factor when it comes to making laws regarding ""self defense"" because unfortunately, women are physically weaker.

I'm tired of hearing that ""this is the culture with [ ] men"" or that my clothes made it seem like ""I wanted it"". Traveling and just this world seems unfair for women and men need to acknowledge their privilege and advocate for changes too. It isn't cool if your buddy assaults me and then you just laugh as if it wasn't a big deal. It isn't cool for you to say that I just shouldn't travel if it's like this. It isn't cool for you to assume that anything I did caused this. ",2856,97,1714610632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ci2ddg/traveling_is_not_the_same_experience_for_women_as/,xrshxa
Barcelona or Seville in late June?,"Barcelona or Seville?

Hello!! I am planning a 7 day trip to Portugal and Spain for my fiance and I in late June. The only definitive stuff thus far is that we are flying into Lisbon, taking a bus to the Algarve and spending the first 3 or 4 days there and then taking a train to either Seville or Barcelona and flying back to the US from Spain.

We are already very familiar with Portugal and have relatives in the Algarve, but very unfamiliar with Spain. I've been to Barcelona once, for two days almost 20 years ago and he's never been to Spain. We like being in walkable cities, with vibrant art scenes and great local cuisine. We're not really beach bums but enjoy beautiful scenery (and we'll have plenty of beach time in the Algarve). Budget wise we'll only have like $900 after flights (but accomodations and a lot of food in the Algarve will be free- thanks Mom).

Transportation wise, we won't have a car and both options present some challenges. If we do Seville,. it's pretty close to the Algarve, but get home we'd have to factor in getting to Madrid (most likely) to fly home and if it's an early flight we'll have to spend the night there the night before. If we choose Barcelona, the initial travel will be long and annoying from the Algarve, but then we can just get a flight back from Barcelona...

Any thoughts or suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated!

EDIT: Based on comments I'm leaning towards Seville- if we decide to do that, do you think it'd be easier to fly out of Madrid or Lisbon? By easier I just mean getting from Seville to that city

For those who say they don’t care being greeted with other languages, maybe you don’t. But it gets annoying  at certain point.

I’m looking for advice on:
	1.	Accessible and budget-friendly hotels: 

Which hotels with elevators and adapted bathrooms would you recommend? I’d prefer not to stay in apartments, and I’d like to avoid spending too much. Are there any discounts or benefits for people with disabilities?

2.	Transportation:

Is the metro fully accessible?
How do adapted taxis work in Barcelona?
Are there other accessible ways to get around the city? What’s the best way to use public transport?
	
3.	Tourist attractions: What are the must-visit accessible spots in the city?
4.	Food: Any nice and accessible restaurants you’d recommend?

Thank you so much for any tips or personal experiences!",2,2,1737815487.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i9o4rs/tips_for_an_accessible_trip_to_barcelona_april/,fernee95

"Is Barcelona worth visiting during La Mercè, or it doesn't matter?","Hi guys,

Me and my girlfriend considering to visit Barcelona in September (less crowded and cheaper month i guess). We honestly want to combine sightseeing and relaxing on the beach. We're discussing two periods, first week of September and last one (with La Mercè included). 

So my question is, is it really worth it to see and be part of this event?

Europe 2025 - Prague to Barcelona,"Hi everyone, 

This will be my third solo trip to Europe and am wondering how my rough itinerary looks for this upcoming May/June. Here's what I have (roughly one month):

Prague (4 nights) - Train to Salzburg

Salzburg, Austria (3 nights) - Bus to Ljubljana 

Ljubljana, Slovenia (2 nights)

Bled, Slovenia (4 nights) - Train \[from Ljubljana\] to Budapest

Budapest (5 nights) - Flight to Portugal 

Lisbon, Portugal (3 nights - my second time here!) 

Porto, Portugal (4 nights) - Super short flight to Barcelona 

Barcelona, Spain (5 nights) - Flight home, also meeting some friends in Barcelona. 

Has anyone taken the direct train from Ljubljana to Budapest? It's about 9 hours it seems, which I don't mind, but I am a little hesitant as I need to make the train early from Bled that morning in order to not miss the direct train in Ljubljana. I was thinking of going from Salzburg to Bled, but it is a 7-8 hour train ride as opposed to the 4 hour FlixBus bus ride to Ljubljana (there is a FlixBus direct to Bled, but it arrives at 10pm). 

For the record, I have explored most of Western Europe already and really want to delve into some of Central Europe and get some ""sun"" towards the end of my trip. I'm not looking so much for advice on things to do, but whether or not this route makes any sense? Should I cut anything out or restructure my itinerary in any way?

Should I get married in Barcelona?,"Me and my fiancee are planning to get married in Spain.

I'm concerned though because I have heard about the backlash that tourist have been getting lately from the locals.  I understand how tourism is effecting their daily lives but we would most likely be staying in a hotel anyway and not contributing to the rental property problem.  We have wanted to go to Europe for a while now and are very respectful to other cultures, but I also don't know the rest of my family or hers will react.  I also don't want there first experience in Europe to be a negative one.  Any advice on if this is still an issue or if it would be better to go somewhere else?

We’re flying from LAX so I’m thinking land in Spain first then go to Paris and then Italy. Is that a good route? Would it be crazy to skip Madrid, Seville, and Toledo while in Spain? Should we save Italy for its own two week trip and just go to Spain and Paris? Appreciate all the help I can get.

"Tips for 2 full days in Barcelona during winter, on a budget (traveling photo nerds)?","Hello everyone,


Myself and 2 other friends will be visiting Barcelona and we'll have 2 full days to explore the city in the first week of December, with the intention of taking photos (we're amateur photographers), drinking some (local?) beers, and eating some local cuisine, on a budget (or where your average salary man would go out to). We've luckily secured fairly cheap plane tickets and accommodation already (100euro flights and stay, per person if anyone is interested, from eastern Europe to Barcelona).


We have 2 goals, visit Sagrada Familia and take photos form the outside, and explore the Gothic Quarter since we're staying right next to it, and again, take photos. Ideally we can add in some other things from your tips in between. Questions for you fine folks, and hopefully locals: 

- Are there are any bistros/taverns/bars where you can eat and drink something local at a non-tourist price or budget you can recommend?

- Are there more obscure areas of the city that have interesting photographic subjects that are not in the top X you can already find with a google search, especially with regards to the more bleak weather we're expecting for December?

- Any thrift shops you can recommend? As photo hobbyists and grown-up nerds we have interests in photo gear and anything 70's/80's/90's clothes/games/etc.


If there's anything else you'd like to mention please go ahead.

"Suggestions for a Family-Fiendly 2-Night Trip from Barcelona (<2-Hour Flight)

I’m planning a three-week trip to Spain from mid-December to early January. We’ll spend 12 days in Barcelona (to visit family) and the rest of the time exploring Madrid, Seville, Granada, and Córdoba.

3. Family-friendly, with activities or attractions that our toddler might enjoy

Barcelona Hotel Question,"My family of four is traveling to Barcelona for a few days in June. It will be wife and 2 sons 13 & other son who will be just turning 18. I see the Hoteling industry in Barcelona (especially the more popular hotels) do this thing where they force families to buy a second room (only allowing 2 to a room) even though they may have single rooms which would accommodate 4. We really don't want to split up things end being disjointed and out of sync based on experience.

Many of these hotels have a suites that have a queen or king size bed plus a queen size sofa bed. The sofa bed would be fine for my two sons but the hotel restricts the hotel room to two or three people. Funny enough, those that offer these room to 3 people, the same room when booking for 2 the price is X but when you book the same room for 3 (if they allow it) the price goes up by \~25-30%.

I'm fine to book a rate without breakfast so not to complicate things (although they have an awesome breakfast at the place I was targeting \[an H10 hotel\]). I'm fine to pay for a room with 3 registered at the higher price. If I understand correctly, anyone over 18 has to be registered anyway so I could just register my wife, older son and myself. Then have my younger son rejoin us a the Elevator when time to head up? My question is this, how closely do they police things and is my plan practical?

I see some of the slightly less popular hotels have picked up on this opportunity and offer family rooms.

What’s the best coffee you’ve ever had while traveling?,"I’ve had a lot of great coffee in my life, but one cup stands out above the rest. I was in Panama, visiting a small coffee farm in the Boquete region, known for producing some of the best Geisha coffee in the world.

The aroma alone was unreal—like jasmine, honey, and tropical fruit all at once. The flavor? Unlike any coffee I’d ever had. Bright, tea-like, and so complex it felt like it changed with every sip. No bitterness, no harshness—just this smooth, almost otherworldly experience. It was the kind of coffee that made me stop and think, oh… so THIS is what coffee can be.

VAT refund Barcelona Airport Experience ,"I’m traveling with my mother in barcelona. I’m flying home earlier than my mother while she continues her travels.

Planning a trip to Italy on Oct/Nov. Rome. Florence And Amalfi coast. Excited to go when it’s more dead and cooler there. ",279,895,1719746620.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1drzb29/whats_one_replace_you_definitely_want_to_go_back/,FilmmagicianPart2
Lisbon—>X—>Barcelona,"Hello Redditers! 

My partner and I are heading to portugal and spain at the end of the month. We purchased one way tickets to Lisbon and then one way tickets from Barcelona to home. So Lisbon and Barcelona are figured out. 

Like the title suggests, we’re stumped on our middle stop. We’re only going for 12ish or so days and of course we could just eliminate a third city and only go to lisbon and barcelona (and still that’s not enough time to truly experience those cities), but we’d like to add a third (smaller) city. Madrid is sort of conveniently located but I think Lisbon, Madrid, and Barcelona in 12ish days is overkill (for reference I have been to lisbon and madrid before, but this would be my partner’s first time).

I’m really fond of the idea of going somewhere in andalusia but game for anything. Some friends have been recommending Lagos/Faro, I’m just concerned that the weather won’t be beachy but honestly idk. For reference this would be around oct 1 if anyone’s been around there at that time.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a third city that don’t require a headache traveling wise? The less modes of transportation the better. I’ve done the headache traveling before like bus to bus to plane to border control etc but this is my partner’s first time to Europe so I want things to be as seamless and enjoyable as possible lol


Thank you in advance! ",1,7,1726421867.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fhi9ae/lisbonxbarcelona/,naihsadrak
Hotel prices are crazy now,"Hey, is it me or hotel/hostels prices have gone up significantly in recent years especially in Europe and North America? I understand that everything is more expensive now, but for christ sake how can people go to Rome now without being crazy rich?

I have enough money to travel, but some country are now completly off my list for now for this reason. I can't seem to find anything in Barcelona, Rome or Berlin that's not north of 200$ for a terrible sketchy room. 

Even hostels now are crazy expensive for a single room.  I don't care about dorms, i'm not 18 anymore and I travel with my SO, 50-70 bucks for a dorm is nonsense still.

It's sad for young people. I was able to afford backpacking in Europe 10 years ago when I was 18, it seems it's impossible nowadays without couchsurfing.

Btw I usually look prices on Booking and Hostelworlds.

Edit : I understand there's plenty of good deals at the moment, it certainly wasn't the case a couple of months ago. Lets say I'm speaking for prices between may and September. I understand that it's the high season but still, I was able to find places in may/june before and september is not THAT busy usually.",728,412,1701196232.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1862zg0/hotel_prices_are_crazy_now/,Available-Ad-4484
