"Madrid is an overrated travel destination, change my mind.","I (Italian) have traveled to Madrid 3 times as a tourist/for work. I have always thought it was a blend city and this last time I came with my GF (French) who had the same opinion. 

Let’s elaborate on it:
- Restaurant: we struggled finding places where we could taste local food that were not crammed and with normal tables and chairs. Everyone eats on a stool or standing, how can this be healthy or comfy?
- Food: the local food scene does not have anything special to offer, mostly bar food, greasy, heavy and tasteless. Seafood is not local, madrid is far from the coast (fried calamari do not count).
- City: this is possibly one of the most boring capital ever. Art is concentrated in the museums and theatres. The city itself does not have anything to offer in terms of architecture. Everything is boring, blend and very recent. One of the only ancient things is the Egyptian “””temple”””. 
- People: some people are nice but most are quite rude, apparently it is the local
way of being (and we spoke Spanish).

As I see that everyone praises this city, I feel obliged to discourage people to come visit Madrid.",38,54,1668607926.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ywuh38/madrid_is_an_overrated_travel_destination_change/,Legal_Ad6240

"Visiting Barcelona, Madrid, and Lisbon. How bad are the pickpockets?","Hello. I plan on visiting Seville, Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon. How crazy are the pickpockets there and what should I expect? 

I’ve visited other dense cities such as Rome, Paris, and NYC. I was super conscious of my surroundings and never saw any sort of pickpocketing. 

Should I feel just as safe visiting these cities? I’ve heard Barcelona was especially bad for tourists.

"Need to cut 1 city - Barcelona, Madrid, Granada, Seville, Bologna, Florence, Cinque Terre","We are planning on spending 3 days in each of the cities but unfortunately need to cut one city from the list. This will be my wife and my first trip to Spain and Italy (or anywhere in Europe), and we like cities with a mix of culture, nature and interesting things to see and do. We aren't big on clubbing or going to bars. Here are the contenders: 

* Barcelona
* Madrid
* Granada
* Seville 
* Bologna
* Florence 
* Cinque Terre

Keen to hear people's thoughts! 

Edit: thanks everyone for the feedback! I should note that my partner and I are quite fast paced travelers and it isn’t easy to get to Europe from Australia, hence why the packed itinerary. But I do understand the sentiment and will take that into consideration.

Barcelona was underwhelming,"Visited Barcelona recently for a few days as part of a larger Spain trip. I had very high hopes because of how much praise and hype Barcelona always gets. 

Honestly though…I was a little disappointed and in fact, I would probably place it as my least favourite place out of everywhere I visited in Spain (Madrid, Granada, Sevilla and San Sebastián). 

Some of the architecture is cool but I felt like there’s nothing that it offers that other major European cities don’t do better. It was smelly and kinda dirty, and I felt some weird hostile vibes as a tourist as well. The food was just decent, and none of the attractions really blew me away, other than Sagrada Familia. The public transit and walkability is *fine* but again, nothing amazing. 

I usually like to judge a place based on its own merits but while in Barcelona I couldn’t help but compare it to other major European cities I’ve been and loved, like Rome, Paris, Lisbon, London, Prague, Istanbul (kinda counts I guess) etc. and finding it a bit lacking.",1156,765,1724721587.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f24vjj/barcelona_was_underwhelming/,Wooden_Mood_3359
Is There Another City That Feels Like Prague?,"I traveled to Europe a long time ago, and I really enjoyed Prague. On the other hand,  I didn't personally connect with Paris. Sorry to Parisians.

Now I’m planning to travel to Europe again this summer, and I want to feel the same charm I felt in Prague—but not *in*Prague this time, because I didn’t have a great experience with the food there. Sorry again.

I’ve been searching online and looking at photos of cities like Vienna, Milan, Florence, Barcelona, Munich, Warsaw, etc. But none of them seem to have the same atmosphere as Prague.

I think there’s something special about Prague—maybe its architecture or the layout of the old town—but I can't describe exactly what it is.

If I can figure out what makes Prague feel so unique, maybe I can find another city with a similar charm.

One week trip: Madrid vs Lisbon vs Both?,"My wife and I are in the final steps of booking a weeklong trip in March. We're stuck between Lisbon or Madrid. For context we've visited Spain in the past, spending a week in Logrono and Barcelona. We also have a friend who lives in Madrid who we could definitely see if we went there and MIGHT be able to join us in Lisbon for a day or two. 

For those who have been to both, how do they compare for price, food, and ease of travel? 

Also, my wife thinks we should choose one or the other, would it be too rushed to try to split the trip between the two?

Update: Thanks everyone! After reading your firm endorsement of both cities, and also getting creative with the booking, we realized the best (and cheapest) option is to fly into Lisbon and travel by bus to Madrid and fly direct out of there. We'll likely spend more time in Lisbon, definitely hitting up some of the cities nearby.",11,58,1726838890.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1flc0nt/one_week_trip_madrid_vs_lisbon_vs_both/,tnnr
"After hours of research, I need some help understanding Madrid Versus Barcelona","I am a 32F from the US going to travel to Spain in February. There were some change of plans from my earlier post, but I am also going to places you all have suggested before Spain.

I understand it all but I found this puzzling: it is commonly suggested to spend more time in Madrid than Barcelona. I am aware Madrid is MUCH bigger (21 districts and 131 neighborhoods is massive), but it seems that Barcelona has that whimsical (Gaudi) experience, arguably more touristic… 

That said, do you all feel I should really spend 2-3 days in Barcelona and 3-4 in Madrid? I have 7 total days. I enjoy museums, architecture, and great food (I know you can’t go wrong in these cities for that.

What airport(s) do you avoid? Which are so easy to maneuver that you’d recommend to others?,"I’m in Madrid right now and had heard how Barajas was very modern and architecturally striking.

You have to go up and down elevators to get everywhere, with lines at all of them.

I’ll stick to Dublin for transatlantic flights from now on.

\*Leave Friday and arrive Saturday in Malaga (3 hour connection in LHR London, different airlines)

\*Sunday afternoon train to Granada

\*Monday and Tuesday Granada  

\*Wednesday morning train to Cordoba, evening train to Seville (?)  or better to spend the night, where would we store luggage with a day trip?

\*Thursday Friday Seville

\*Saturday train to Madrid

\*Sunday morning flight out of Madrid

"First time traveling to Europe- how to efficiently spend 2 weeks (London, Paris…Madrid)?","Hi everyone,

My wife and I got married last year. We were planning to spend the second leg of our honeymoon in Europe, but based on availability, points conversions etc ., it’ll be better to go in September and use this as our belated First Year Wedding Anniversary travel rather than honeymoon.

We are both history buffs that learned French growing up from Grades 1-12 and also love shopping and dining. London and Paris are no brainers for us. I have heard conflicting opinions about traveling around as much as possible vs. honing in on a couple of major cities.

We would definitely start out by flying into London and spend 3-4 days there. From there, we’d go to Paris either by train or flight and spend at least 4 days here. Having an extra day in Paris is very important to my wife. We really only planned on London and Paris, so aren’t sure what would make the most sense to do with the rest of our trip. I was thinking of either going to Spain and spending 3-4 days in Madrid, or splitting that equally between Madrid and Barcelona.

I think this is how we’ll ultimately end up before returning home to South Florida:

London for 4 full days 
Paris for 4 full days
Madrid for 4 full days

Account for 2 days spent in the air.

Would it make sense to get back to London and catch the round trip back to South Florida from Heathrow (on points), or would it be better to just do a one way back from Spain for the sake of time?

Or, are we selling our selves short? With only 14 days, should we hone in on 2 cities only? Or should we add an extra day or 2 to our trip, work and $$$ permitting?

So.....I'm weighing up which one to go for. Rome clearly will have more options in terms of museums/galleries, although I do want to visit the Reina Sofia in Madrid. However what appeals about the latter is that I can plan a couple of day trips, most likely Segovia and Toledo.

What could be the deciding factor is how much is going on 1st January. While I know everything starts closing in both places on the afternoon of 31 Dec, it seems a fair number of events happen around Rome on NYD. Has anyone been then? Also Madrid seems to be a bit of a ghost town on that day.

Cities that never sleep which are busy from 10 pm-5 am? ,"What are some cities that are bustling from 10 pm - 5 am (midnight, early morning hours)? In other words, where you can easily find something to eat outside at street stalls, cafes, and supermarkets during times like midnight or 3 am.

It's because I'm a digital nomad who typically works night shifts with clients and employers on the other side of the world. Having to stock up on convenience store food at 8 pm and then heating everything up with a microwave isn't exactly fun.

I find that most cities around the world are sleeping from 12 am - 4 am, except for a few cities that genuinely never sleep, such as Cairo and certain parts of Singapore (Geylang and others).

Frankfurt Airport (FRA) is the worst airport ever,"I posted this in r/TravelHacks some weeks ago about layovers in Frankfurt, and thought it would be interesting to share in this sub about my experience connecting there. But for starters: I never thought, as a traveller, that I could hate an airport so much. 

For starters - remote positions for a 747 is such a dumb idea. Arriving there and a tow truck broke on our assigned gate. Not a great start. Then comes endless walking and confusing signage, coming back to where you started, the same concourse having Schengen and non-Schengen flights. I even exited the security zone by mistake and there were no signs whatsoever about this. 

Then comes very rude and unhelpful staff: security agents speaking German even when you say out loud you do not speak the language. One agent before passport control pretending he wasn’t listening to what I said and acting like I was stupid. I have not seen one single smile or politeness in those people. 

The mice! Right by a Lufthansa lounge, a mouse comes off the wall, grabs a piece of food from the floor and comes back. Or just casually crossing one side of the corridor to the other. Are the mice traps working? Guess not. 

I’ve been to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Madrid, Milan and all of those make sense, have centralised passport/security controls, and helpful personnel. It’s a shame that Lufthansa (which seems to own that place given how many flights they operate) allows this to happen. Not to mention the multiple passport/security checkpoints which allow you to pass them twice. It’s just a massive loophole.

"8 days in Spain, starting and ending in Madrid - is that enough time to visit another city or should I just stick to Madrid and its surrounding towns?","I’m planning some solo travel around a work trip to Madrid next week and I want to use my time effectively. This will be my first time in Spain and I’m currently torn between two options:

1.	Split my time evenly between Madrid and another city - I’m thinking Barcelona, Valencia, or Seville, or even crossing into Porto (though I’ve been there before)
2.	Stay in Madrid for the full week and take day/overnight trips to surrounding towns (Toledo, Sergovia, Salamanca).

My first day off will be next Friday (11/10) and my flight home from Madrid to London is 3pm the next Saturday (19/10). I’ve heard that 8 days is too much time for Madrid but I’m worried that things will be too rushed if I visit a second city but only spend 4 days in each.

Because of the flight schedule, I must start and end the trip in Madrid. I like walking and street photography, and I can speak basic Spanish. I also want to keep costs low so I’ll probably be staying in hostels for the entire trip.

Travel Conundrum. París or Madrid-Andalusia,"Hello! I'm giving my mom a trip to Europe and I'm torn between Paris and Madrid-Andalusia in early April.

We will have about 10 days to travel (maybe one or two more depending on travel time). I'm coming from Michigan and my mom is coming from Colombia. 

París seems to have more of a wow factor with things that are iconic. Travelling there would cost us about 1600 for both of us but the flights are really easy. I know Paris is expensive too. I will do Paris and maybe spend a weekend in another nearby region 

Madrid and Andalusia sounds a bit less iconic for what my mom knows but I know Spain is so so beautiful and also more affordable. Flying there would be like 1200 but I have to fly to Istanbul and on the way back I have an overnight layover. I would try to take the train to Séville and explore around Andalusia. I'm a bit concerned that the time is too tight maybe. But the affordability could be a big factor. 

I'm struggling a bit. What would you do? ",1,15,1736262145.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hvtblh/travel_conundrum_parís_or_madridandalusia/,convospeaknew
Can someone either talk me into or out of this proposed itinerary? (Advice: Madrid/Granada),"Hello all. 

I am looking at a few options for travel later in the year (specifically November, although it doesn't have to be this month) and I was looking at Granada to see Alhambra. November is ideal for me based on my work schedule and also having mild weather for the region at that time of year. 

However, I see that there looks to only be one flight in to Granada each day, connecting from Madrid. I know that Malaga airport exists as well and is relatively close by, although getting to Granada would be another headache that I wouldn't want to deal with after a long transcontinental flight (I am from the US) and a connecting flight, and language barrier (my Spanish is okay, but I don't feel confident about it enough to really trust it-- I would also be doing this solo, which compounds my fears a little bit too) which would always stress me out. So, seeing as how I am not particularly comfortable about this, my alternate thinking would be to fly into Madrid and treat it as a long layover in a sense (I've always wanted to see Madrid too, but this would obviously not be doing it justice, which is another concern of mine-- would I be doing it just to check off a box, you know?) 

The flights I am currently looking into would land in Madrid at around 8:00 or 10:00 local time. I figure that would give me enough time to see at least most of the key sights in the city at a leisurely enough pace (I am mainly only really interested in the Royal Palace-- however not going in for a tour or anything like that-- and Parque del Retiro if I only had less than a day) as well as doing some self-guided walking tours, etc. 

That being the case, I would spend the night in Madrid and then take a train the next day to Granada and stay there for a few days, seeing the main sights of the city on arrival day, Alhambra the next day, and then a hike in the Sierra Nevada the next day. The tricky bit that I am wondering about is whether it is worth it to train back to Madrid and spend another day there before I depart back to the US or potentially fly back out of Granada (I think this would be more expensive). I would just be stressed about that because with only one flight out of Granada a day, if I missed it, I would be screwed. 

Basically, I am wondering if it would be a waste of time (and money, hotels in Madrid for these two nights would be more than what I have estimated my whole time in Granada to cost, for instance) to follow the below schedule: 

Nov. 21 -- Land in Madrid, see a few sights, etc. 

Nov 22-25 -- Train to Granada. Checking out of hotel on 11/25 and getting the train back to Madrid on that date. 

Nov 25 -- Back in Madrid and fly out the next day -- I would probably stay somewhere close to the airport just out of my own paranoia and so I can rest easy knowing I can get to the airport quickly and stress less about it on a tighter schedule (the return flight would be at around 10:00 in the morning). 

I am planning on doing something similar when I go to Ireland in a couple of months, where I'll be landing in Dublin, moving partway through to Belfast, and then returning the final day of the trip to go back to Dublin/airport area rather than trying to make a more complicated journey to the airport on the date of the return flight (I am a very nervous person in case you couldn't tell). Any information or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

TL;DR -- Would you spend less than a day in Madrid before going off to Granada or would you try connecting from Madrid-- either to Malaga or Granada proper? ",2,5,1743957484.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jsyacm/can_someone_either_talk_me_into_or_out_of_this/,mdubs17

Madrid / Andalusia itinerary help,"Hi all, I'm planning a working trip to Spain (tourist in the am, computer in the pm) - April 21 - May 2. 

I'm a solo traveler looking to get the feel of a different place, take in some art/history/culture, enjoy some great food and walk my feet sore during the day. I speak a poor form of rudimentary Spanish and hope to improve that before going.  

Could you help me with the itinerary portion for Andalusia? 

I'll start out in Madrid on Monday, April 21 for 4-5 nights. I've been there for work a couple of times, but not spent any real time there outside of El Prado and a few good walks. I'd welcome a hotel recommendation in a good neighborhood (IHG even better!) and some killer restaurants for a solo traveler but am sure I can figure this out or post separately. In case I have to cancel the trip will be doing all hotel reservations. 

From there I'll go to Andalusia. I'll have from Fri/Sat April 25-26 to Friday, May 2, departing flight from Malaga. If I can push that back a day or two I will. I could use a lot of help here on where to go, stay, how to get about, etc. 

My constraints / questions for Andalusia are:

* I'd like to see the Alhambra (either Tuesday, April 29 or Wednesday, April 30) - so I guess that means staying at least 1-2 nights in Granada? Or can I successfully daytrip to the Alhambra? 
* I'd like to limit my number of stops and hotel stays - I'm guessing I'll have 2-3 between a starting point, Granada and Malaga before I fly out. I understand that will limit what I'll see and that's ok. 4 hotels in 7-8 nights would be a lot while working. 
* In terms of other places Seville is obvious - I've already spent a weekend in Seville and loved it; happy to return there but is there another spot I should consider? 
* I'd prefer to not rent a car to keep cost down but can do that if it makes my life easier vs. harder (e.g. finding places to park the car, extra parking hassles, etc...). 

Budget is pretty flexible - I'm hoping to do most hotels on points, flights are on points and then I'm not overly concerned... I figure $100/day average for the rest of the trip is doable but I could increase that if a Michelin restaurant, guided tour or a car rental is going to enhance my trip.

Why isn’t Heathrow widely flagged as a nightmare for connecting flights?,"The whole experience at Heathrow made me decide to avoid the airport in future entirely for connecting flights. Compared to other American, Arab and European airport, in Heathrow you have to:

1. Go through the nightmare security theater yet again (T5) even if the flights are on the same booking reference.
2. Except for not being required to take shoes off, the security theater is the worst here. Not only do they enforce the 100ml liquids like every other airport but this is the first and only time I’ve been asked to throw away sub 100ml liquids because they don’t fit in the ridiculous 20x20cm clear bag, a rule which isn’t even enforced by TSA in the US…
3. Chaotic lines - I thought the British were known for queuing? There were no security line anywhere but just law of the jungle. People were allowed to barge thru without facing any consequences 

My question is… why isn’t this talked about more? For example, people complain about TSA in the states etc. but this was easily the most horrible experience I’ve been through and made taking the connecting flight a nightmare. When transiting through Munich or DC, you simply don’t need to go through security again if you’ve already been checked through in your Origin airport.

"Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Portugal - is my trip long enough?","As title says,

My wife and I were planning on flying into Barcelona, staying for 3 nights, taking a train to Madrid for 4 nights, spending one day in toledo then taking a train to Seville for 3 nights and trying to see Alhambra and/or Granada…

After that taking a short plane ride to Lisbon and spend about 4 nights there.

A total of 14 nights. Are we doing too much?

I was thinking of shortening the trip to 10-12 nights and skipping Portugal and just spending more time in Spain, seeing more of Granada, alhambra and Toledo.

My wife also enjoys leisure days to explore and shop.

Student discount: Will a middle school student ID work in Barcelona and Madrid for a HS student?,"I'm currently a US high school student (international) and will be traveling to Spain (Barcelona & Madrid) in a few weeks. I didn't get my high school student ID issued, so the only thing I have is my middle school ID. The problem is that although it has my photo, my birth date, and the school name in English, my name is not in Roman alphabet, and I'm now 18 so I was wondering if museums would absolutely deny my validation of student. (Also it doesn't say STUDENT ID on the card) The card always worked in my home country, however.

Would it be better to get my high school ID issued before I travel to Spain or get at least the online version of ISIC the card? Or will showing my current student profile on my school website work?

I know the flexibility depends from museum to museum (I heard sometimes even the student ID doesn't work if you're not an EU resident), but I wanted to figure it out since I'll be going to several museums and most of them seem to offer student discounts.",0,3,1740340043.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1iwiona/student_discount_will_a_middle_school_student_id/,Severe-Friend-8004

How many days in each?","Hi guys, I am a 28m traveling with the wife. I am used to traveling and planning ahead, though Spain gives me FOMO and I am not even there yet. lol It seems there's so many little towns that one shouldn't miss which makes it almost impossible for me to decide.

BTW I know that Madrid is logistically better than Barcelona, however it seems Barcelona takes the same time to travel from than it would if I was in the Andalusia region getting to Granada for example? **Should I skip Cordoba, Granada, or Barcelona?** I'd love to hear your thoughts.

**What I like:** I am more into meeting kind people, great taps, good drinks, beautiful alleys, old architecture, romance for the wife, hole in the walls, hidden gems, a nightlife of bars and plazas, open late with a good crowd, flamenco, shows. 

**Not interested in:** I am not particularly interested in seeing too many churches, or going clubbing. I saw a lot of churches in Italy and other parts of Europe.

"14 Days: Porto, Lisbon, Seville?, Madrid - itinerary for Feb 2025","Hi all, 

I’m visiting Portugal and Spain for the first time next month! Will be traveling by public transit. I love art, good food, being active, hikes, seafood, pastries, street eats, scenic views, and live music. Yeah I love food :D I'm not into partying or nightlife, though drinks are aight.

Day 1: Porto — landing at around lunch time

Day 2: Porto (Douro Valley)

Day 3: Porto (Guimaraes / Braga)

Day 4: Porto

Day 5: Porto > Lisbon — early train

Day 6: Lisbon on a Monday

Day 7: Lisbon (Sintra)

Day 8: Lisbon (Cascais)

Day 9: Lisbon > Seville by plane

Day 10: Seville

Day 11: Seville > Madrid — late train (\*\*may switch earlier, for safety)

Day 12: Madrid on a Sunday

Day 13: Madrid

Day 14: Getting to the airport

My tickets are booked for Porto and Madrid already. I considered extending my trip but realised I'm unlikely to be doing day trips in Madrid after 1+ week of transfers and travel. My interest in Madrid is the art museums.

All in all, I have 3.5 full days in Porto, 4 days in Lisbon, 1+0.5+0.5 days in Seville, and 2 days in Madrid. Ideally, I'm trying to go for mid-paced, but not bored. Let me know what think! :)

**Questions:**

1. **Day 4**: I’m thinking whether to split Braga / Guimaraes, do Coimbra, do a walking tour in Porto, or add a day to Lisbon instead.
2. **Day 9**: Must fly out of Lisbon on Day 9 due to flight schedules. Am open to changing my flight for Madrid. Ambivalent on Seville - not sure how I feel about the key attractions of Real Alcazar and Cathedral, but heard Seville's worth the visit for a different vibe from Madrid. What do you think? Seville, Lisbon, or Madrid for Fri / Sat?
3. **Picking Attractions**: I got all-templed-out in Japan and Cambodia haha. Am thinking of doing one to two of each attraction across all the places I’m visiting - e.g. palace, garden, art museum, bookstore?, church/cathedral, ruins. Which would be your picks?

Traveling is not the same experience for women as it for men and it's insane what women face around the world,"Anyone who thinks traveling (or just traveling and honestly just existing) for women isn't hard - I urge you to think about the millions of women who face harassment. I myself have been either sexually assaulted, harassed, groped, catcalled heavily or followed in: Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Waterloo, London, Lisbon, Rome, and Naples. I was recently assaulted in Naples and posted about it to let people (esp women) know what can happen and instead I received messages from tons of men telling me I'm ""playing a sad victim"" and that I'm crying about it (I was literally hugged, groped, and kissed today by a total stranger on the street while walking)

It's not easy being a woman and still enjoying things worry free like men can and it sucks we've created a culture and a world where this is prevalent. I'm not saying men don't have to be worried about solo travelling, but women have to be worried about everything men do AND assault on top of that. It's to the point where I can't even go out at night when I have paid to travel to cities, or go to famous landmarks, or bars/clubs, or even take public transport at night. 

On top of that, things like pepper spray and such are illegal in so many countries and harming the other person (as self defence) may even result in the woman being punished if the law deems so. But we need to understand that women cannot defend themselves like men can in situations such as being attacked. We are simply not that strong physically. I know for a fact that I and many other women cannot get a man off us if we tried to. So why are we expecting the same ""self defense"" efforts from men and women? Knowing that using a pepper spray will get me in trouble with the law but the man who raped me can walk away if proven innocent blows my mind. 

I'm tired of following endless precautions yet still being targeted for things like this and assaulted. People are always blaming women too like ""oh you must've dressed wrong"" or ""you must have smiled at him"" and if not blaming women, people will only be giving tips out on what women can do to make sure that they are not assaulted. But WHY are we pinning everything on women and making it their responsibility? Why can't we teach guys that this is not okay by having stringent laws and punishments and just realizing the human factor when it comes to making laws regarding ""self defense"" because unfortunately, women are physically weaker.

I'm tired of hearing that ""this is the culture with [ ] men"" or that my clothes made it seem like ""I wanted it"". Traveling and just this world seems unfair for women and men need to acknowledge their privilege and advocate for changes too. It isn't cool if your buddy assaults me and then you just laugh as if it wasn't a big deal. It isn't cool for you to say that I just shouldn't travel if it's like this. It isn't cool for you to assume that anything I did caused this. ",2847,97,1714610632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ci2ddg/traveling_is_not_the_same_experience_for_women_as/,xrshxa

Visiting Madrid for 4ish days. Need advice on itinerary.,"Hi!

I will be in Madrid for approx. 4 days, from 6-10 April. I have a few things in my mind that I'd like to do, and I wonder if anyone can give me some insight regarding travel tickets/events and such.

Out of the 4 days I will most likely spend Sunday and Monday in Madrid itself, just walking around, mainstream sights and the likes (flight outbound is on Tuesday at 6am) I am considering going to a bullfight, although I am not sure how it is perceived in Spain at the moment. I found a place that sells combo tickets for a city tour + bullfight on Sundays, but I don't know if that's the best available option.

For the first 2 days, my plan is to visit a couple nearby cities like Toledo or Segovia, possibly both (or if you have a better recommendation, I am open to suggestions) My main question is, what would be the best ticket option for me? Should I just buy day passes for when I am in Madrid and the return train/bus for the other cities, or is there a better option than that? I am also wondering whether there would be any events in Madrid or nearby at that time that I should not miss (mainstream or ""hidden gems"" just as much)",83,46,1679840876.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/122nr8e/visiting_madrid_for_4ish_days_need_advice_on/,KirstenTillson

On the flip side I made sure we have central AC in our lodging ha…. We’ll be staying a week then a few days in Lisbon.

"Itinerary Critique: 2 weeks in Iberia (Madrid, Seville, Lisbon) ","Hello. My fiancée and I are trying to plan our honeymoon for the last two weeks of March. We've decided on the Iberian Peninsula because my fiancée speaks some Spanish and wants to travel somewhere she can use it, and the weather there in March seems decent. This is the first major trip we've ever really planned and we're struggling to decide where we should go and for how long, because we don't want to fall into the trap of going too many places in too short of time but we also want a good variety of experiences.

  
Below is the general itinerary. I've decided not to count days with traveling as time in either the departure or arrival city, even though a lot of the travelling shouldn't take the whole day, just to keep it simple: 

* Arrive by plane in Madrid from the US (Allotted full day)
   * Spend 3 full days in Madrid, with potential day trip to Toledo or Segovia
* 3hr train from Madrid to Seville (Allotted full day)
   * Spend 3 full days in Seville, with potential day trip to Cordoba
* Short-haul flight from Seville to Lisbon (Allotted full day)
   * Spend 3 full days in Lisbon, with potential day trip to Sintra
* Leave out of Lisbon back to US (Allotted full day)

So our questions are:

1. **Does this itinerary involve too much traveling? Do the durations we’ve planned for each location make sense?** I thought spending at least three days in each place would help balance the travel times, but I’m wondering if some destinations might need more or less time. Should we even consider cutting the trip down to just two places? I’m particularly unsure about the flight from Seville to Lisbon, it seems like there aren’t many good alternatives to flying for that jump.
2. **Would it be worth the extra travel time to replace Madrid with Barcelona?** Madrid is more convenient due to its connectivity, especially since Barcelona would add an extra three hours to the train ride to Seville. However, Barcelona feels more appealing to us, particularly because of its architecture. We're wondering if that extra travel time would be a worthwhile trade, because Madrid seems great too. 
3. **Do these cities seem like a good combination?** We chose these because they seem like they would give 3 distinct vibes while still giving a good taste of the region. Is that a good assumption? We're wondering if maybe we should choose more radically different places. ",0,7,1733187632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1h5b61h/itinerary_critique_2_weeks_in_iberia_madrid/,dumb-secret

"African American Women in Rome, Racism Yes, but Mainly Positive","Here in Rome for 3 days before embarking on a cruise with my mom and teenage daughter around the Mediterranean.  I know people are traveling here frequently and have some fears around racism abroad so I thought I'd share our experiences in Rome.  

I'll get the negative experiences out of the way first. We went on a food tour through Trastevere. There was 8 of us plus our Italian tour guide. Everyone was white except us. As we were walking through a crowd of young Italian males (probably early 20s), one of them says the word ""Monkey"", out of nowhere in English. We were at the end of the line in our tour so I don't think anyone else in our group heard.  I was so shocked that I actually questioned myself for about 5 minutes whether I actually heard that. But I did. A feeling of sadness began to settle over me. I did some mental and emotional wrestling and decided to not let a miserable racist person have that affect on me. I feel like it's letting them win, it's giving them what they want. If my mom or daughter heard it, they didn't say anything and neither did I.  We didn't discuss it with each other. This is my first time discussing this.  So that happened, but by the time we started tasting food, I was distracted enough to move past it and enjoy our tour.  


On the flip side, a hotel clerk at a hotel we weren't staying in saved the day when she let me use her personal adapter to charge my phone for 20 minutes. It died and I had no idea how to get to the meet up spot for our tour.  After going to a grocery store and a restaurant where no one could (or would) help, she did that and was so sweet and gracious about it.  Everyone at the hotel was very friendly towards us as we cooled off, got water and waited while my phone charged. Since we weren't staying there, I was worried how they might treat us but everything was cool.  

I would describe customer service as nuetral. Not overly friendly (but sometimes).  The only other questionable thing was today when the meetup person ( not our guide) for the Colosseum turned their back to me and my daughter as I approached them to check in.  I said ""Ciao, scusi,  we need to check in please"". He turned around and apologized profusely and checked us in and apologized more. All the apologizing made me think he turned his back on us on purpose and maybe it was a race thing but I'm not sure.  

We've sat in quite a few restaurants and had mid to great experiences.  All of our tour guides were fantastic. Rome itself is a true site to see with so much history it's all mind blowing. 

As far as pick pockets and hustlers are concerned, just keep your head on a swivel.  At the Termini train station we were definitely targeted. We were super obvious tourists looking extremely confused and weak trying to figure out how to buy tickets to Trastevere and then back to the airport. People kept approaching us, calling us ""sister"" and at first my mom kept being too nice and interacting with everyone. She bought a scarf 😩 at the Vatican. But after that she just kept quiet while I said no thanks no thanks to everyone. But they are SUPER PERSISTENT. This guy literally threw a ""free"" bracelet at my daughter after we kept refusing it. We just let it hit the ground and kept moving. 

My advice is to not be surprised if someone is blatantly racist towards you if you're black. But also don't let that stop you from coming here. Why should racist people get what they want and prevent us from living our best life?

Another thing that happened is that a tourist from Kazakhstan was filming us as we were eating dinner at a food court type place at the airport. My mom, caught her and said ,""why are you recording us? Please stop it right now"" to which she replied, ""I'm from kazakhstan"" and keeps recording us. My mom then says ""ok. you need to stop filming us right now"" Then the lady comes over and the woman she's FaceTiming tells my mom , ""I'm from kazakhstan"". Before my mom totally loses it, I said to the lady, ""You're being rude, it doesn't matter where you're from, please leave us alone, and stop recording us right now."" She finally walks away. That was wild. But not an uncommon experience when traveling while black. So many people have no idea how to act when they see people who don't look like them and everyone else where they're from. They start treating you like you're an exhibit at the museum. 

So we're leaving tomorrow. I have mixed feelings because it's been ""a lot"" in both good and bad ways. I'd like to come back in the slow season though. The positive experiences heavily outweighed the negative. There's so much we didn't get to see. We're on to France, Tunisia, Greece, Malta and Spain next. Wish us good luck and please share any experiences you've had in those places so I'll know what to expect. Thanks in advance.

"Which city in the world, in your opinion, needs the most days to visit.","In my experience, there are 2 cities that are in their own league when it comes to how many days you need to see all that’s truly interesting and it somehow just doesn’t get boring. Those are London and New York.

In those cities, I have a feeling that even after you have been there before, you can easily still spend 7+ days in the city just exploring new areas which are all crazy interesting.
When I was searching this topic a little bit, I often saw mentioned Paris, Hong Kong or Moscow - but already here in my experience of Paris and Moscow where I was couple times, I don’t see more than 3-4 days of active exploring before it repetitive and you start coming back to the same areas.

Of course you can always spend days in places like Louvre or Ermitage museum - but lets try to keep it realistic that average person dont spend more than half a day in those places

"car rental driving from Lisbon, PT to Madrid, ES - big dropoff fee for one-way","Hi Travelers,

Planning a 3 week trip to start in Lisbon, driving north up the coast of Portugal, stopping at a number of places (Obidos, Tomar, Batalha, Coimbra, Aveiro) and then ending in Porto.  From there, driving across the Duro valley and staying in Salamanca, Segovia, Avila, Toledo and then ending in Madrid.

Needless to say, should be an epic trip and looking forward to this!  But, I do believe that driving via car on this trip is really essential.  In other trips to Europe I have sometimes found that these spontaneous trips in the country are the highlight (did this last year in Dordogne, France was amazing for this sort of trip).  Only need the car for 2 out of the 3 weeks on the Iberian peninsula, since days in the cities of Lisbon and Madrid we will not need it.

I noticed that doing a one-way picking up rental car in PT and dropping off in ES is not super straightforward.  National does not allow it at all.  Hertz DOES allow it (and, I currently made that reservation already but can always cancel) but they charge a 750 EU fee for doing the one way drop off.  Total for 2 weeks of car is 1900 EU for a compact car, which is not terrible but it just really hurts to have that 750 EU fee for no obvious reason.

I was wondering if others might have advice on this?  For example, should I try to do 2 separate car rentals (one in PT, different on in ES) to avoid this fee?  But, in which case, should I try to do a ""border crossing"" for that second pickup?  That doesn't sound convenient and might run the risk of just wasting alot of time.

Anyone else out there run into this particular issue?

Thanks for any advice

Edit: corrected total car rental price to 1900 EU

  
UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the very helpful comments.  By breaking it up into two separate one-way rentals (Lisbon->Porto, then catch a ride to Vigo, Spain and do Vigo->Madris) the total cost through Hertz was 950 EU as opposed to 1900 EU for the exact same model of car and exact same number of days.  That is quite a cost savings, for what is only an additional 2-3 hrs spent on the extra leg to cross the border!",0,16,1722803654.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ek567t/car_rental_driving_from_lisbon_pt_to_madrid_es/,groguthegreatest

Is the anti-tourism in Barcelona really that bad?,"I'm planning to go on a little trip with two of my girl friends in September. All 3 of us are from Europe and it's the first time we go on vacation together. 

We really wanted to go to a city in Europe and Barcelona seemed perfect for us. That was until we did further research and saw all the news about locals complaining about tourist, protesting and ""attacking"" tourists with water guns. That kinda put us of. 

We're not the kind of people to get really drunk and be loud in the streets late at night. But we don't wanna be somewhere, where we aren't welcome.
Or is this all mostly exaggerated by social media?

Some other cities we considered are:
- valencia
- Seville
- Rome
- Lisbon 
- Porto 

What we had in mind of doing in the city is: walking around (sightseeing), shopping, going to the beach or the park, visiting cultural monuments and maybe go out to a bar once

We're still very young and inexperienced, for my friends it's the first trip without parents (I already did a solo trip to Prague). We also know this trip is maybe quite ""last minute"", but it was also a spontaneous idea.

Homebasing in Madrid or Barcelona for 5 Days?,"
My husband (23M) and I (26F) will be traveling to southern Europe this summer! I am SO excited. This will be my first time visiting Europe. We are flying into Barcelona at the end of May and plan on being in Spain for about 5 days, then move onto France, then Italy. Our major question is: 

MADRID OR BARCELONA?!?!


A little about what we like to do when traveling: see the sights, eat GOOD authentic food (hole in the walls, street food, aubela in the kitchen cooking up a storm), and I have a special goal of catching some sun rays. We are Texans, but are currently living in WA and I am so ready for warm, sunny days. We love seeing historical sights and we will likely want to go out to a club at least once. We enjoy dance clubs that play pop music that is fun to dance to. I’m not a big house/edm girly lol

I was leaning more towards Madrid because I see it’s more historically Spanish (and I think id like to visit Toledo), but the beaches are really appealing in Barcelona. 
I have been watching blogs and reading recommendations, but would love to hear from anyone willing to share their thoughts and opinions. Either way, we plan on spending 1 night in one place or the other or taking a day trip to one, but can’t decide on which to stay in for the majority of the time.

"Trying to Figure out Spain Itinerary - Madrid, Barcelona with maybe Seville, Granada and Cordoba","I'm traveling to Spain for 12 nights at the end of August.

Madrid Hotel Advice,"Traveling to Madrid in early June and looking at hotel options. Looking for something that would allow us to be able to walk, see the sites and explore. Looked at the Social Hub but seems a bit far to the Northwest and would be a very long walk from things. Thought I liked the Walt, but the wife read several reviews about “human defection” in the streets directly in front of the hotel. Thought about the Hard Rock, but feels too American, and unsure about the area but might be the best bet thus far.

Looking for lodging in Madrid next April/May,"Hi all, I will be in Madrid next spring (end of April beginning of May) and am looking for recommendations for a hotel near the city center.

2 adults 0 children.

We need one with an elevator since neither of us are spring chickens, and we've been told that a lot of hotels are bereft of elevators.

A friend of ours recommended the Hotel Catalonia Plaza Mayor. Is this a good place? It was about $212.00/night or  $850 usd total for a city view room. While it's in the budget to go that high, it's a bit of a stretch for us and we were hoping for something a bit lower cost, but still good and not sketchy.

Thanks in advance for any other options.",0,2,1727467194.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fqwncs/looking_for_lodging_in_madrid_next_aprilmay/,bobchin_c
New year's Eve in Madrid or Barcelona?,"I'm thinking of going to Spain for 9 days in the end of December to the beginning of January (6th). 

I'm not sure whether to just stick to Barcelona and spend new years there and do day trips or fly into Madrid spend new years in Madrid and then go up to Barcelona by train .

Which do you recommend for new years (I will be solo)?
Or would you disregard Madrid completely and stick to Barcelona. I've never been to Barcelona and visited Madrid when I was 12 so I honestly don't remember much. 

I'm an art museum lover and want somewhere with nature or access to nature(mountains/snow/river lakes kind if thing hell even just trees) because I simply don't get nature in my country. 
Also is the weather cold?

Overnight layover in Madrid,"I'm arriving in Madrid airport at 7:30pm and have a flight departing at 7:20am. I'll be spending the night at the airport because I don't feel the need to spend money on a hotel just for that time. But the least amount of hours I have to actually spend inside the airport, the better, and since the city center isn't that far away, I was wondering if maybe I have enough time to go for a walk in Madrid before returning to the airport later. I know it isn't a long time, but it's not like I intend to go sightseeing and get to know the city in that short amount of time (especially at night) - I was thinking more just grab dinner and a drink somewhere just so I don't have to be in the airport for those 12 hours. I read that the metro is open until 2am, so I guess I'd go back to the airport around that time. For anyone who knows Madrid better than I do, does this sound feasible?

I wonder, for those who have visited Madrid, is it generally better to stay in an Airbnb vs Hotel? He is staying at a residential soccer camp for 9 days so we don't need much space. I do want to be able to cook my food though. Both for saving money and because he is vegan and I am pescatarian. Do you think they will be able to accommodate his veganasim as much as they promised they would? 

  
Also, is 85,000 MILES and 1800 good for premium economy one way there and economy one way back? It is so expensive to fly there!

Madrid or Copenhagen in March?,"So my wife and I are hoping to go somewhere in March 2024. I know that isn’t the best time weather-wise for a lot of places but it is a bit of a birthday gift for the both of us. 

Anyways, we originally got this in our heads because we saw a great deal on a direct flight from Chicago to Copenhagen. Well, we were too slow on that good deal and now the prices have gone up a bit. 

Now I just saw there is an even better deal on a direct flight to Madrid during the same time period. 

So my question is, if you were in our position would you wait to see if the flight to Copenhagen has another price drop (according to price history it has dropped to this price a couple of times in the last 60 days) or go with the great deal to Madrid? Obviously Madrid is a sure thing price-wise and the weather will likely be nicer, or at least warmer, but Copenhagen seems more “cool” to me. 

We would love to go to either Denmark or Spain, so either will be a great trip, but can’t decide which route to go.

Edit: Added context. Either trip will be around a week depending on when the flights hit. Either Friday to Sunday (Copenhagen) or Saturday to Sunday (Madrid). If we went to Copenhagen, we’d probably stay there the whole time and do some day trips to Malmo and North Zealand.

"2 weeks in Madrid, Northwest Spain, and Portugal","Hi fellow travelers,

I'm planning a trip to Spain and Portugal for \~14-15 nights starting mid October. The rough plan (check the photo in the maps) is to:

* Fly in to Madrid, spend 3 nights there, then pick up a rental car **(Nights 1-3)**
* Go north up to the Basque Country --> then northwest / south across the coastal roads, stopping for maybe 3 nights in Bilbao + couple of different coastal villages along the way **(Nights 4-6)**
* Return rental car in Vigo border town, and cross the border by train from Vigo to Porto
* Spend 3-4 nights in Porto with day trips to surrounding areas (river, wineries, any other suggestions?) (**Nights 7-9**)
* Pick up car and drive to Lisbon, checking sights along the way, maybe spend 1 night in Nazare (**Night 10**)
* Return car and spend 5 nights in Lisbon + couple of day trips to surrounding areas (Cascais/Sintra, maybe Southwest Park?, other suggestions?) (**Nights 11-15**)
* Fly out from Lisbon

Any general thoughts / advice are welcome. Does this make sense? Anything to keep in mind? And some specific questions:

1. For day trips from Porto and Lisbon respectively, does it make sense to rent a car to do these? Or better to join a guided trip with viator or something similar for example?

Days 4-6: Barcelona

Day 7 (travel day): Leave Barcelona

\- Transport. If I arrive to the airport with a family where each member has a luggage there is always a taxi with the space to carry all of us without needing to prepare the transfer in advance.

\- Hotels and AirBNBs are good to great, clean, and there are details that it not common for average hotels in the world.

\- People are kind

\- Food is relatively cheap, healthy and faboulous. Also vegan options. Visiting supermarkets is a must.

\- Transport is great

\- - The local airlines are bad (e.g. Iberia, Level).

Boarding denied: Barcelona to Dublin,"Well, writing this from the BCN airport.

Had an early morning flight today to DUB from BCN by Vueling. Boarding was denied at gate claiming no valid documents to travel. It was a birthday vacation with wife (birthday tomorrow). 9 days were planned across Ireland starting today until Nov 3rd.

We hold Indian passports, reside in Barcelona with Spanish Residence Permit. Good travel history with over 30 countries across 4 continents, valid US, UK visas in addition to the Spanish residence permit.

We were travelling to Ireland under Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme (SSVWP) which allows Indian passport holders to visit Ireland without Irish visa if I have a valid short stay UK visa and I have entered UK in the last 180 days. Our exit from Ireland has to be either before UK visa expires or the UK entry permission of 180 days expires, whichever is the earlier. My UK visa is not issued in India, hence it's not a BIVS visa which gives entry to both UK and Ireland. But the Irish SSVWP is applicable for the UK visa I hold.

Coming to the current incident, flight was at 5:40 in the morning, we left our home at 1:00am, reached airport at 3:00am. Our boarding pass was issued, UK visa was verified, we checked in a bag and no drama while issuing the boarding pass. Fast forward to 5:00am while we were boarding, I unfortunately met one of the worst behavioured and unprofessional dumbass at boarding gate. She claimed that I need Irish Visa to travel to Dublin. I explained her the case, but she was very negligent and not interested to listen. She called her ""so called boss"" and asked if she can allow us and we are travelling with UK visa and apparently her boss said no. Meanwhile I kept telling her it's not just UK visa, but with entry stamp of UK within last 180 days. She never heard and just kept saying no. I even had the mail from Irish Embassy in Madrid stating that I can travel to Ireland. The rule exists in Irish govt website and IATA travel center website as well. She was just saying no to everything and was behaving as if she has the final say. I requested to talk to her boss to which she denied. She even rejected my request to give it in writing. She wasn't even listening to my case, she started shouting ""no""  in the very beginning if I even try to talk. I wasn't even sure on next steps or how to go back as I will have to cancel my exit immigration. I tried asking that, the moment I opened my mouth, she started shouting ""no, you need a visa."" She called the security and then we were escorted out of the boarding area, through immigration to the arrival area.

As it was early morning, no customer center was open. I went to the check-in counter and found a representative of Vueling, who looked like manager of the people who handle check-in. I explained him our case of denied boarding, he took us to a check-in counter where they called Dublin airport (I assume Irish immigration officials in Dublin airport) and explained the case. On receiving the confirmation that we can travel, he rebooked us on a flight later in the evening. He told us that he has entered the message in the system under our booking so that people at boarding gate will know our case.

Post this, we went back to the arrivals area where our checked-in bag was lying on the belt, collected it and came back to check-in the bag again in about 20mins. Guess what, repeat of same story. It was some other stupid employee in the check-in counter this time, rejected to check us in saying we need Irish visa. I explained her the story, we were just denied, it's your colleague who rebooked us just couple of minutes ago, he has entered the message in system against our booking, we are travelling with visa waiver, but all she was saying is that I need Irish visa. I lost the patience this time and just shouted at her to go home if you do not know the rules and are not interested in working. Thankfully found that person who rebooked my tickets, and he told her our case and we are checked-in now. 8 more hours to kill in the airport before the flight and I am still not confident that we will be allowed to board in the evening flight. He has told me that he will inform the necessary people and assured us that we will fly. Sitting at the airport, just with hopes as only the time will answer.

We had our train booked to Galway from Dublin today afternoon which we will miss, will have to figure out our last moment stay now in Dublin. I am skeptical of booking this even now as I am not confident that they will allow us to board in the evening.

All Vueling has given us is a rebooking on a flight 13hrs later, meal vouchers worth 40 euros per person. I would like to know from the travel community - what are the rights I have here and whom do I reach out for compensation? I have raised the compensation request with Vueling through the app already, but I definitely dont want to settle here for something small. In addition to the waste of train tickets, a night stay in Galway, I will have to book a last moment stay in Dublin and all the stress and harassment. Plus I lost a day of my trip.

TLDR; zero knowledge employee at boarding gate denied us from boarding the flight. We are at the receiving end, sleep deprived us, wasting time from 3am at airport and now waiting for the rebooked flight at 6:30pm in a hope that they will allow to board.

Connecting flight in Madrid airport ,"Hi guys!
I booked a flight from Rome to Cancun with air Europa with a 2 hours stop in Madrid.
I booked via a travel agency and they assured there won't be any problems for the connecting flight.
I will land in Terminal 2 in Madrid and the flight to Cancun will take off from Terminal 1.
My question is: how can I reach Terminal 1 from Terminal 2? Are 2 hours enough? Will I have to re do security checks?

Barcelona vs Madrid which to Visit? ,"Hey so il be doing a longer term trip to Europe in October. Will be going to a festival in Amsterdam and then spending a bit of time in Berlin. 
I wanted to go to Spain as a bit of more relaxed part of my trip lol but I’m caught between the two..

Ryanair nightmare ,"Hi all,

Just wondering  what are my rights here? Should I expect any compensation? Is it worth complaining? 

We were flying Ryanair from London to Porto, and literally 10 mins from landing in porto, the flight gets re-routed to Madrid due to bad weather. So over an hour and we land in Madrid. We are then stuck on the tarmac at Madrid for 4 hours while they made a decision about whether we get off at Madrid or they re-fuel and take us back to Porto. I run out of water to make milk for my 8 month old daughter. They won't give out bottled water for free and their payment system was broken. Honestly the panic i felt that I wouldn't be able to feed my baby.

I started crying, other passengers were offering me their water.  
After much pleading, they gave me ONE bottle of water.
We were on the plane for 7 hrs in total, for what was meant to be a 2h20 flight.

My main issue is that it seems to be their policy to not give out water, regardless of however long we are stranded on the plane. How is that legal?

Thanks. ",893,136,1716668591.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d0koq0/ryanair_nightmare/,Altruistic-Pie-5841
"Itinerary help: Girona, Collioure, Costa Brava, Barcelona, Madrid","My bf (31) and I (27) are going to Spain for my 28th birthday this August-September for 3 weeks. We consider ourselves slow travelers as we love to relax while not feeling rushed but we still wanna make the most of our trip and see a good amount. I know a lot of these places are accessible by day trips but we want to minimize the amount of day trips we take. We love eating, exploring, spending time on the beach, taking in the beauty of architecture, views, and charming places, and seeing beautiful towns and villages. Our hotels and transportation is still cancellable so there is still room for changes. This is our itinerary:

Arrive in BCN in afternoon from Miami, take the train to Girona, which we will probably arrive in the late afternoon or early evening, and spend 3 nights in Girona (technically 2 full days)

Then leave Girona and go to Collioure (taking the train from Girona to Perpignan and then train to Collioure), spend 3 nights in Collioure

After, we will take the train from Collioure to Perpignan back to Girona, and rent a car there, and drive to Tossa de Mar and spend 7 nights in Tossa exploring the entire Costa Brava (we want to have time to relax on the beaches near Tossa, hike, and explore the Camí de Ronda, as well as Begur, Sa Tuna, Calella del Palafrugell, Cadaques, Pals, etc.) 

Then, we drop off the car in Barcelona and stay there for 4 nights

Then take the train to Madrid and stay there for 4 nights 

Then fly home to Miami 

Thoughts? Thanks so much in advance!

Better to do day trips from Barcelona or Madrid ?,"A little background: my boyfriend and I are young and active, always prioritize finding good food and drinks, like being by the water or in the mountains and not the biggest history buffs. 

I don’t know if I should spend more time in Madrid or Barcelona when it comes to day trips. It looks like Madrid day trips are history based and/or hiking (correct me if I’m wrong) while Barcelona looks to be more coastal towns. I really don’t know which to go with here and hoping people can help!

Also I got a lot of comments before hating on Barcelona - may I ask why? It looks so beautiful in pics and the food sounds great. Maybe I’m missing something…",0,8,1712424012.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bxgw0p/better_to_do_day_trips_from_barcelona_or_madrid/,ProfessionalFun9779

Help choosing flight for Madrid-Vilnius?,"My main concern is arriving right on the dates that I have planed, without (if possible) any terrible delays that make me lose any days.

I've found the following options (skipped any airlines that looked dodgy):

- Madrid - Kaunas + train/bus to Vilnius: Ryanair flight. Direct flight to Lithuania, close to Vilnius. The main issue i see is that this flight only takes place every Monday and Thursday.. meaning that if for some reason the flight gets canceled.. it seems like I would have to wait at least several days until there is another flight(?).. I'm not entirely sure what airlines typically do in a situation like that.

- Madrid - Warsaw/Helsinki - Vilnius: LOT or Finnair flight. Layovers appear to be between 3hrs-4hrs, So it would take a whole day basically.. but there are multiple of these flights every day.. so I imagine if the worst were to happen I would be put on a different flight the same day or the next possibly(?).. Again no idea how airlines solve those kinds of predicaments.

I'm not a frequent flyer, so I find all the potential permutations and possible setbacks a bit overwhelming.. I'd love to hear the thoughts of people who've flown more than I, regarding which of these options seems most likely to get me to my destination without losing out on any of my 10 days there.

Thank you!

"2 weeks in Spain (Madrid & Seville), Thoughts on Itinerary?","I will be traveling to Spain with my immediate family and my boyfriend in mid May to celebrate my birthday 🎉 

We'll be in Madrid for days 1 - 6 and then traveling to Seville on day 7 and staying there through day 10, flying out on day 11. 

I've been to Spain once before, coincidentally that was also a birthday trip, but it was a 2 week tour of the country and we didn't get to spend much time to really explore beyond the essential landmarks. 

For this trip, I definitely want to prioritize ""slow"" traveling or as close to it as possible. But, I've never really done that before lol

For Madrid, each day we'll explore a new neighborhood/area (ie. La Latina day 2; Chueca day 3; Barrio las Letras day 6). I thought that would be the most manageable way to avoid having to shuttle all around the city in one day. 

The plans for Seville are a little more open. Would appreciate suggestions on how to structure that leg of the trip. 

Would also appreciate restaurant suggestions for Lunch and Dinner for each corresponding neighborhood :)

Let me know what you think...

**Madrid** (staying in Lavapies)

*Day 1* 

* Arrive at AirBnB around 5/6pm; 1700/1800hr
* Get settled in 
* Go to supermarket (we'll be making breakfasts at our accommodation)
* Explore Lavapies (take a walking tour maybe)
* Dinner (open to suggestions in Lavapies)

*Day 2*

* Free 2hr walking tour of Austrias 
* Lunch - La Concha - try vermouth
* Spend day exploring Austrias & la Latina (any suggestions for places to check out in this area?)
* Sunset Temple Debod 
* Dinner (tapas crawl maybe)
   * Calle de la Cava Baja in la Latina

*Day 3*

* Half day trip - Escorial (back by lunch time)
* Lunch in Chueca (suggestions that have good menu del dia?)
* Explore Chueca + Sol/Gran Via (suggestions for places to check out?)
* Rooftop bar
* Dinner in Chueca (Sol/Gran Via may be a little too touristy and $$$; is that incorrect to assume?)

*Day 4*

* Day trip to Toledo
* Dinner at Botin (I've heard mixed reviews, any alternate restaurants I should consider?)

*Day 5*

* Free day; shop/explore

*Day 6* (birthday!)

* Brunch (suggestions?)
* Reina Sofia museum 
* Retiro park
* Explore Bario de las Letras

* Free 2hr walking tour  

*Day 8*

* Grocery store

*Day 9*

* Real Alcazar 9:30 AM
* Breakfast/Brunch - Bar El Comercio
* Plaza de Espana + Parque Maria Luisa
* Setas (night light show)

*Day 10* (last full day)

"Family trip - Paris, London or Madrid","I'm looking to schedule a trip for myself, my spouse and our two kids.   Kids are 7 and 9 and are good travellers.  However, we have only traveled (as a family) in the U.S. so far and I would like for them to experience traveling out of the country.  I want to expose them to different kind of travel and I personally prefer to explore rather than stay at a resort for an entire trip. 

We live in New York and recently did a trip to the west coast to visit several cities in California.   We wanted to see how they would do with a longer flight and more of an exploring trip as opposed to Disney or a resort vacation.  Now we feel like we are ready to plan a trip to Europe with them. 

The hard part is while they are still young kids, they aren't so little that they need kiddie attractions.  I am having difficulty deciding where to bring them - they're too big for real kiddie attractions yet not old enough for teen attractions.
 
For kids of their age group who are from the nyc area - they enjoy being outdoors (parks, boat rides, etc) and enjoy museums that aren't too stuffy. I imagine they'd like to visit a castle or iconic tourist sites that they have heard of.  We are totally fine with a ""touristy"" trip because we are tourists.  An indoor pool or a one day theme park would also be good for them.  

With that being said, would you suggest London or Paris? Any other cities come to mind?  I personally would love to go to Madrid and do some day trips but I'm not sure if it would be enough fun for the kids.  Ideally we would like a city base with maybe a day trip or two wherever we end up choosing. 

Finally, we would go in fall or spring simply because summer is probably too pricey for us.   Last question...am I being selfish and should I book a trip somewhere warm like Costa Rica where we can explore a bit yet still have a resort with a pool? I know I can just go to Europe with my spouse but I want then to experience it.   Thanks everyone!

"What I learned during my 34-day trip across Spain, France and Italy.","**Trip summary - 33 nights:**

* Spain: 10 nights in total
   * Madrid: 3 nights
   * Sevilla: 3 nights
   * Granada: 2 nights
   * Barcelona: 2 nights
* France: 6 nights in total
   * Paris: 4 nights (day trip to Versailles)
   * Lyon: 2 nights
* Italy: 15 nights in total
   * Turin: 2 nights
   * Milan: 3 nights (day trip to Lake Como)
   * Venice: 2 nights
   * Bologna: 1 night
   * Florence: 4 nights (two day trips, one to Siena, San Gimignano and Pisa and one to Montepulciano, Pienza and Montalcino)
   * Rome: 3 nights
* Spain: 2 nights in total
   * Madrid: 2 nights

This was my first time organizing a multi-city trip, so even after months of research and organizing, there are some things that I would do way differently.

**What I learned:**

* I live in Panama and we decided to get a round-trip ticket to Madrid because it would be cheaper than flying back from a different city. It sounded doable while we were comfy at home but after a month of non-stop traveling, we realized what a huge mistake that was lol. We were so incredibly tired that we would’ve rather paid more to be able to fly back home right away instead of going back to Madrid first.
* I’m glad I took my time researching and booked popular places months in advance. I traveled in May and the lines were incredibly long, especially in Italy. It was still worth it even when we had to pay a small fee for pre-booking.
* It was a mistake going to Bologna just for one night. We went only because we had an extra night and we thought it’d be cool to go there to try the food since we’d heard so many good things about it. We had breakfast, which was good but nothing out of the ordinary but the real disappointment was dinner. We went to Trattoria da Me because of the good Google reviews, and it was just meh. It would’ve been better to spend an extra night in Rome or Florence. \*\*EDIT: I liked Bologna and would like to go back in the future. I just don't think it was a good idea to pack up all our stuff and travel there just to stay one night, considering we were very tired by that point. The restaurant was disappointing for sure, but I really liked the city and would like to explore the surrounding area one day.
* I saw a lot of advice about not staying just one night in a place because of how tiring it is, so I thought two nights would be fine for the smaller cities. Yeahhh, no. I’ve since learned that three nights is much better and doesn’t make me feel as frazzled as just two nights. YMMV, though.
* The trip was way too long for us. Even though our days weren’t packed full of activities we were still exhausted halfway through the trip. We still enjoyed it, don’t get me wrong, but I think it would’ve been better to just do one country and only two to three weeks max.
* Train travel is awesome! So much less hassle than taking flights and we really appreciated getting to our destination right in the city center.
* I would never travel again with a suitcase for a multi-city trip. I took a backpack and my mom, who is 69 years old, took a carry-on-sized suitcase. I had no issues with my bag but being the good daughter that I am lol I also carried my mom’s luggage and we struggled on public transportation. If you’re planning on taking taxis then this may not apply but I wouldn’t personally do this ever again and taxis may not even be doable in places like Venice where water taxis are insanely expensive.
* If I could travel back in time and rearrange our itinerary this is what I would change while still keeping the same countries and the same amount of nights:
   * Spain: 10 nights in total
      * **Madrid: 4 nights (add a day trip to Toledo or Segovia)**
      * Sevilla: 3 nights
      * **Granada: 3 nights**
      * **(We loved everything we did in Barcelona but the city itself wasn’t very nice. It was crowded and dirty, and we didn’t think it was worth the detour to go there.)**
   * France: 7 nights in total
      * **Paris: 7 nights (three day trips instead of one, one to Versailles, one to Lyon and one to Strasbourg)**
   * Italy: 16 nights in total
      * Milan: 3 nights (day trip to Lake Como)
      * **Venice: 3 nights (add a day trip to Verona)**
      * **Add** **Cinque Terre: 3 nights**
      * Florence: 4 nights **(two day trips, one to Siena and one to Montepulciano, Pienza and Montalcino. Originally we got a guided tour for both trips and while we loved the second one, we think it would’ve been better to just visit Siena on our own.)**
      * Rome: 3 nights
* However, if I could start over from scratch, I would’ve just focused on Italy and left Spain and France for future trips. We did so much because we felt like we had to do as much as possible but now I know that’s not always the best.

Sooo, that's it for now. Overall I still loved our trip and I'm already saving up for our next destination (maybe Japan?).",925,243,1686168487.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/143ngwi/what_i_learned_during_my_34day_trip_across_spain/,lucialorena2

2. I land at 2:30PM - I am thinking of just taking the train straight to Seville. This way I will already be in Madrid before my departure. I would only need to move hotels once rather than twice. This also gives me an extra full day in Madrid. Is it reasonable to take the train straight to Seville on the first day? I am thinking ""yes"" but if this is a bad idea, please let me know why!!
3. Any recommendations for day trips from Madrid?
4. I will be travelling solo. I've heard Spain is a very social country. Am I going to look like a weirdo sitting by myself?
5. Any and all food reccs so I can start drooling over food pics.",6,8,1706653258.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1af17rn/two_weeks_in_madrid_and_seville/,Mysterious-Treat-840

"I want to go back to Madrid, but I don't know if now is the right time.","I went to Madrid last July for an Arctic Monkeys concert. I spent six months planning, and while parts of it were good - the concert, the Prado, the Royal Palace, looking at all the pretty buildings - I also got awful food poisoning my second day there and it set a bad tone for the rest of the trip. I kept getting lost, my hostel wasn't comfortable, and I just felt really exhausted the entire time I was there. 

Lately I've been thinking about going back this June to see if I can do better, but it may not be the most responsible decision right now. I currently have no car, am unemployed and living with my parents. I've got pretty substantial savings and could definitely afford another trip, but I also think I should put that money towards getting back on my feet. 

I know I don't need to go back right now, but it feels like such a monkey on my back. ",0,7,1709612271.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1b6w6yt/i_want_to_go_back_to_madrid_but_i_dont_know_if/,bernardmarx27
Air Europa Madrid Customer Service Rep,"Hi I have a story that happened today 6/12/2024 and I would like to gather some opinions to normalize my experience, see if I’m way off, or if I should even do something about this. I’m not someone who likes to dwell but this situation was embarrassing and I feel accountability may be needed.

I took a flight from Barcelona, to Madrid, to Porto. All with Air Europa, my first time using this airline. On the website they have baggage requirements. On the first flight, I was able to bring my bag on the flight. The flight was great, the flight attendants were very kind, and my mother and I were happy. While waiting for my connection to Porto, a man randomly walked up to us, asked us if our flight was to Porto or not, and then claimed my mother and I’s bags were too big. Us being from another country and me previously having damaged luggage, we were anxious about giving  luggage up. I told him this a couple of times and he did not care and raised his voice. He thankfully let us both put our bags in the sizer and unfortunately, yes my bag did not fit, but my mothers did. However, I did not see anyone else’s bags get sized throughout the process. When I said I’d really like to keep my luggage having 7 days left on my trip, he begun yelling where the whole line could hear and begin staring, bear in mind we hadn’t even got in line and he pulled us from waiting in chairs telling us not asking. I asked kindly for his name incase I did lose my bag and he refused. The other two women were kind and softly toned and said I could take any important things out of my bag, but he took over the situation and even began cussing towards me in another language (I believe German). My mother said “May I have a supervisor” and he said no. A scene was created and he said if I don’t want to check my bag, I won’t fly and began canceling our flights in front of us. At this point, I defused the situation as I believed he was using his power to his advantage, possibly taking out other anger in his life on me and my mother by taking over his coworkers chair and literally canceling our flights in front of us. I ended up giving up my bag because time is of the essence and it took a lot of effort to go on this trip as me and my mother had to pay for respite care for my father who is at home and both of us took time off of work. 

Please let me know if I’m out of line. When we did get in line. A woman said the same thing happened to her and she didn’t understand why the man was yelling so loud. Thankfully, I did get my bag. The bag did not fit and I understand the rules, but the way the situation was handled does not sit well with me, especially creating a scene and cussing in another language towards me.

All in all, this is a minimum thing compared to the amazing things that come with traveling. Thanks everyone :)",1,1,1718204370.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1de8qr1/air_europa_madrid_customer_service_rep/,Ok_Flow5560

Madrid & Barcelona in Sept. Where to stay?,"Hi guys, heading to Madrid for the first time ever and Barcelona for the first time in 15 years. Would love advice on which neighborhoods to stay in. It will be and my husband, early 30s. Would love to be able to walk to restaurants & bars, but we won't be out all night partying. I like to be centrally located, but not touristy.

Malasana in Madrid seems like the place to be, but I'm also reading that it can be super loud all night. I'm sure that's dependent on the block, though. Barrio de las Letras & La Latina both seem really lovely. 

  
El Raval seems central to things I want to see in Barcelona. San Antoni seems really hip!

I fly through Madrid Barajas fairly often with no troubles, but last time I flew, I had some issues and was wondering if anyone could help. I am flying in internationally with Iberia to T4S and flying out to smaller Spanish city with Iberia. Everytime I've had a flight like that, my connecting flight is out of terminal T4 at gate H, J, or K. However, last time my flight originally said gates HJK and then changed to gate M. I had already taken the train to terminal 4 and followed to signs to take it back to 4S but I couldn´t figure out how to get to gate M. I end up going through exiting customs, asked an employee, and they told me it was after entrance customs (I am Spanish resident with USA passport). This means I took the train twice, went through exiting customs once for no reason, and entrance custom an extra time for no reason. Is there an easier way to get to gate M if this happens again?",2,1,1717472353.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d7nr1h/madrid_aiport_t4s_gate_m/,RecordingUnited2280

3.5 days exploring central Portugal or visiting Madrid?,"I have a 2 week trip to Portugal planned in early April, flying into Lisbon and flying out of Porto and plan to explore both cities a good bit. I have a 3.5 day gap in my itinerary that I am trying to decide how to fill. I am choosing to either work my way up Portugal - some combo of Nazare, Coimbra, Tomar, and Fatima, or taking a short flight to visit Madrid for the first time.

For some context about me, I am a man in my early 20s, I will be traveling alone, hoping to stay in social hostels. I enjoy big cities but also beautiful nature. I am honestly not that much of a museum person but I love learning more about the local culture via guided tours. I am open to suggestions - from my reading it seems like Portugal has a robust train network to use and the towns will be fun to explore, especially as it is the off season and things will be slower paced. But I also would enjoy going to Spain and participating in some of the nightlife. Which would you all recommend?

Skipping Madrid on a Spain/France trip?,"Hi all. Planning a France/Spain trip in February and still working through timing of things, would love some recommendations.

I am flying into Paris and out of Barcelona. I have about 14.5 days to work with, not including flight days. I'm looking at starting in Paris, then Nice, then Madrid, then Barcelona. 

I would like 4 full days in Paris, then thinking 3 days(ish) for Nice to see Monaco, Cannes, and Nice itself. With this schedule, that leaves me about 3 days each for Madrid and Barcelona, factoring in travel. I'm a little concerned that I will want more time in Spain -  a big reason for this trip is to practice my Spanish. I am considering skipping Madrid and just spending a longer time in Barcelona to minimize travel days, make some time for day trips, and have time to enjoy it more leisurely. I am not sure if this is the right call. It is much easier to get to Barcelona from Nice, but I really like Madrid and don't know that I want to skip it completely. 

For context, I have been to Spain before and went to Madrid, Sevilla, Granada, and Barcelona. I absolutely loved it. I am returning with someone who has never been to Europe, so we are focusing more on the big cities. I have also never been to France.",1,9,1705214946.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1969qdm/skipping_madrid_on_a_spainfrance_trip/,guavabonita

Feedback and thoughts on my trip to Madrid and Seville (9 Days) - November,"I have a trip coming up for Spain for which I will be traveling in areas around Madrid and Seville. I technically have 9 days excluding any major travel time. I will be flying into Madrid and flying out of Seville. I'd like to take a couple day trips to see other cities as well, but I fear I may be adding too much to my schedule.

I will mostly be sight seeing and wandering around the city, mostly with an interest in architecture, history, and of course food. As I do research I keep questioning myself on if I want to shave a day from my home base in Madrid and spend more time in the Andalusian area. I could shave off the visit to Segovia.

If anyone has been in this area who has similar interest, please let me know your thoughts.

My tentative plans are:

Day 1 (Madrid) - Fly in, explore Madrid

Day 2 (Madrid) - Explore Madrid

Day 3 (Madrid) - Day Trip to Toledo

Day 4  (Madrid) - Day Trip to Segovia

Day 5  (Seville) - Train to Seville, explore Seville

Day 6 (Seville) - Explore Seville (Real Alzazar, Catedral, Plaza de Espana)

Day 7 (Seville) - Explore Seville

Day 8 (Seville)- Day Trip to Cordoba

Day 9 (Seville) - Day Trip to Granada

We are going back to Madrid for her 30th birthday soon, marking 10 years since our first trip. 

I’d love to find something to surprise her with that is a unique experience, where we can become immersed in Madrid culture somehow - be it food or music or whatever. Not just a standard walking tour but something more special, like a cooking class perhaps.
