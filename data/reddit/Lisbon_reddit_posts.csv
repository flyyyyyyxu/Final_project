My personal opinion about Lisbon..,"Well, i just arrived from a couple of weeks travel around Spain (Andalucía) and Lisbon, Portugal.

Andalucía simply magical as always, and Madrid of course, incredible.

But Lisbon.. I don't know how to start.
It was my first time, and I was really looking forward to it.
I heard amazing thing about it over the years, so my expectations were quite high (not much, since i learned that over the years).

Resuming, the most overrated place I ever been in my entire life..
Overcrowded as hell, extremely dirty, the whole city smells like pee, broken bottles literally everywhere and the local people pretty much unfriendly (can't blame them much tbh).
I speak fluid Portuguese, but even like that it was hard to get nice answers in general. 

It was like a never ending spring break, every single day. Luckily I didn't stay on the main touristic part, but in the Azul area. 

Full of europeans kids drunk as hell everywhere, acting worst that on a first Full Moon party on Thailand. 

Some tiny details that actually shock me were the floors.. 
It seems no one mop that city in ages. From metro stations, restaurants, to the traditional calçadas, everything look extremely sticky and dirty. You can see it easily.

Look, i come from South America and i live in a big South East Asia city.
I know what is the street, the mess, the craziness. And I'm fine with it. But I wasn't expecting that level of mess from Lisbon.

I found the food super basic, the coffee TERRIBLE for what they say (literally the worst coffees I had were in Lisbon), the weather not particularly nice, and over priced..

Both my wife and I got the same impression, so i thought, I can't be the only one thinking this.
Till I found some posts were local people living in Lisbon, mentioned the same things as me.

So, why this place is SO overrated?
I can't get it.

The biggest highlights of the trip were the Gulbenkian Museum and it's park, and a day trip to Cascais (basically not Lisbon).

Oh, i forgot. The day I arrived Gun's N Roses were playing on the city, but they were not tickets available.
Luckily for us, the concert was outdoors and the stage and screen were totally visible from the outside.
So we enjoyed the whole concert for free.

But something extremely weird happened, and for me specially being South American, I can't understand or accept.. 
Half concert, almost half of the public start leaving the place! 
Literally, the best songs hadn't started yet, and half the audience was leaving the recital.
A huge lack of respect towards the band. I simply don't get it. 

Well, that's my opinion about Lisbon.. 
It was one of the biggest disappointments on almost 14 years travelling. 

Please have in mind that this is a personal opinion, and I'm not trying to offend anyone.

"Visiting Barcelona, Madrid, and Lisbon. How bad are the pickpockets?","Hello. I plan on visiting Seville, Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon. How crazy are the pickpockets there and what should I expect?

Should I feel just as safe visiting these cities? I’ve heard Barcelona was especially bad for tourists.

What once-popular tourist destinations are now largely forgotten or abandoned?,"# 

I'm curious about places that were major tourism hotspots in the past but have since fallen into obscurity or been largely abandoned.

Some examples that come to mind:

* **Bodie, California**: Once a booming gold rush town with 10,000 residents and countless visitors, now a preserved ghost town state park
* **Varosha, Cyprus**: Former Mediterranean resort that attracted celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor in the 1960s before becoming a ghost town after the 1974 Turkish invasion
* **Belle Isle Amusement Park in Detroit**: Early 20th century premier destination with 50,000+ daily summer visitors before closing in 1982
* **Hashima Island (Gunkanjima), Japan**: Industrial tourism site with record population density in the 1950s, abandoned in 1974 when coal mining ceased
* **Spreepark, Berlin**: East Germany's only amusement park that attracted 1.7 million visitors annually before closing in 2001

What other places have you encountered that were once overrun with tourists but are now largely forgotten? What caused their decline - geopolitical changes, economic shifts, environmental disasters, changing travel preferences?

Also curious if you think any of today's over-touristed destinations might experience a similar fate in the future! Maybe Lisbon or Barcelona?",2163,1101,1745790939.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k9fmq3/what_oncepopular_tourist_destinations_are_now/,FrozenOppressor
What are some beautiful cities that are completely ignored?,"I’m not talking about Bologna as an alternative to Florence, or Porto as an alternative to Lisbon, but about beautiful cities that seem to not even serve as backups or cheaper alternatives.

Five examples from my travels:

Pittsburgh - This American metropolis of 2.5 million has beautiful scenery, great pre-war architecture (Cathedral of Learning, Gulf Tower), fun activities (Baseball @ PNC Park, Andy Warhol Museum) and is very affordable.

Puebla - This Mexican metropolis of 3 million has some of the most incredible baroque churches I’ve seen and great food. It’s so close to Mexico City and yet gets little foreign tourism.

Tainan - The Kyoto of Taiwan that seems to be completely ignored outside of Taiwanese. Very historic and beautiful pictures with historic structures next to palm trees and mangroves.

Turin - A very affordable Italian city with a classy vibe, some incredible museums (Egyptian Museum, National Museum of Cinema, National Museum of the Automobile)

Wroclaw - Very cheap, with a historic center, beautiful monumental structures (Wroclaw Town Hall, Centennial Hall) and some stunning churches.

Any others I’m missing? They don’t have to be big (I though Stirling, Scotland was stunning and had Edinburgh vibes with a much smaller population).",2299,1036,1743427026.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jo2yf9/what_are_some_beautiful_cities_that_are/,RainbowCrown71

Chaos in Lisbon Airport at immigration control,"I recently travelled from Dublin to Lisbon and got stuck for 4 hours on the passport control queue (non-EU). I initially thought that I got really unlucky and faced an extreme situation at the Lisbon airport.

However, after chatting with people that day and with friends who recently travelled to Lisbon, I realised that this is now the norm for Portugal airports. Apparently they changed their system and are (way) more strict in regards to passport control.

The queue for EU passports is much better, though. But still not great.

The day in question, I was extremely fortunate to have food and water with me, but other people were not so lucky. I saw a lot of people crying, people desperate about missing flight connections, people ~~starving~~ hungry... 

At the beginning, the airport employees helped people with flight connections and gave us some water, but after 1 or 2 hours, they all disappeared. And then chaos ensued. A LOT of people jumped the queue, there were a few arguments, people screaming... Total chaos!

I sent a complaint on the Lisbon Airport website, but at the moment I didn't receive any reply from them.

I am extremely concerned because my father (on his 70s) is coming from Brazil to Ireland the next month and he is coming through Lisbon. I bought the flights months ago and I considered re-routing it to another country, but it's not possible. There would also be a language barrier, as my father only speaks Portuguese, but I think that's minor compared to the inhumane conditions at Lisbon.

Is there anything else I can do additionally to the complaint I already sent? Or just hope that the Lisbon Airport will drastically improve their operations?

Does anyone faced something similar there and have any tip to share?

Thanks!

HELP PLEASE- Left Passport on plane and being told they are going to send me home.,"I just flew on TAP Air 204 from EWR to Lisbon. I left my passport and wallet in my seat back pocket. I messed up big time. I am sitting in the police holding station in the airport. They are telling me no one has found my passport. It was in the seat back pocket, 100%. Now I am just sitting here feeling hopeless. They are saying they are going to send me back today. Does anyone have any advice??? Is there any TAP air number I can call??? All the ones I have called have done nothing. Just forwarded me to someone else. Please help. I am devestated.


*UPDATE*
Holy Hannah this post blew up. Supporters, thanks for the support and advice. Haters, I deserve it. Bonehead move on my part. I just landed back at Newark, waiting to get off plane. I was pretty much completely denied being allowed to talk to TAP while in Lisbon. Hopefully I can speak to a gate agent here and get some info. The plane I was on went back to Newark after my flight, and I am hopelessly hoping it was on that flight and made it back here... if so, I'm getting on the 1050 flight back😂. If not, I secured an 8am passport appointment in the city tomo morning. If all goes well, hopefully I can get on the 5pm out of Newark tomo and meet my lady to salvage some of our trip! Also, still need to hope I make it through customs at a reasonable hour tonight. Global Entry, its your time to SHINE.

*UPDATE 2*
Global Entry for the W. Walked right back into the U S of A, no questions asked. Not one form of ID on me. TAP in EWR was just as useless, call this email that, no one could give a shit and I no longer have the energy to push. Going home and getting some sleep, then passport place in the AM. Also, TAP seemed to cancel my flight home because I flew home today... seems kinda fair but also kinda BS. Any advice on that? Should I just eat my loss and rebook round trip? Sorry if my wording right now is confusing I am delerious.


*UPDATE 3* For anyone still curious... I got my passport at 2pm in NY today. Made the 535pm flight to lisbon out of ewr. Currently in the customs line in Lisbon. Wish me luck!

American who just visited Portugal ,"Just wanted to talk about how European culture is so different than American. I’m walking in the streets of Lisbon on a Tuesday night and it’s all filled with street artists, people, families eating, everyone walking around, shopping, and living a vibrant lifestyle. I’m very jealous of it. It’s so people oriented, chill, relaxing, and easy going. I get that a lot of people are in town for holiday but it just feels like the focus is on happiness and fun. 

In America, it feels like priority is wealth and work which is fine. But I think that results in isolation and loneliness. Europe, you got people drinking in streets, enjoying their time. I don’t think there’s any city that has that type of feeling where streets are filled to the T, eating outside, and having that vibrant lifestyle other than maybeeee NYC. What are your guys thoughts. Was I just in vacation mode and seeing the bunnies and rainbows of Europe? Is living there not as great? Sometimes it just feels like in America it’s not that fun as Europe culture and more isolating. Now I blame this on how the city is built as well as Europe has everything close and dense, unlike America.

Portugal but skip Lisbon. Am I nuts?,"My wife and I are planning our first trip abroad in a decade in October and chose Portugal but have run into an odd snag.

Every location we have considered we have fallen in love with. Porto, Madeira, The Algarve even places we don't plan on stopping like Braga and Evora. But we can not get excited about Lisbon!
Part of it is for sure the headache we have had finding a place to stay and part of it is likely that neither of us are big fans of crowds or cities.

We have come up with a potential itinerary of the following.

3 nights Porto

3 nights Lagos

2 nights Sintra

4 nights Madeira

2 nights Porto (possibly one night Douro)

Are we nuts for considering not doing Lisbon? Neither of us have been before or anything and I have no doubt it's a spectacular city.

"Lisbon, Lyon, or Amsterdam? Two day travel recommendations","Hello!

I am going to be in Europe for work next week and will have two days on the end of my trip in which I can travel. The options above are the ones I have landed on. 

A bit more context: I am a late 20s American male that will be traveling alone. I have been to Europe before, living in Copenhagen for 6 months. While I lived there I visited Paris, Florence, London, Bologna, Venice, Berlin, Hamburg, Oslo, and Bergen. Additionally, I will be going to southern Italy this year in September. I do not speak any European languages beside Italian (English is my native language). 

What I am looking for, in order of importance:
- Food/wine/cocktails
- Solo travel friendly 
- City that I would not necessarily go to for a dedicated trip across the pond 
- Walkable city/good public transport 
- Beautiful scenery
- Affordable
- English friendly

I am down for mostly anything, so if you have any suggestions outside of Lisbon, Lyon, and Amsterdam, I am all ears! I am open to anywhere in Europe, but I’m looking for a direct flight in and then an easy flight back to the US. 

Thanks in advance!

Barcelona was underwhelming,"Visited Barcelona recently for a few days as part of a larger Spain trip. I had very high hopes because of how much praise and hype Barcelona always gets. 

Honestly though…I was a little disappointed and in fact, I would probably place it as my least favourite place out of everywhere I visited in Spain (Madrid, Granada, Sevilla and San Sebastián). 

Some of the architecture is cool but I felt like there’s nothing that it offers that other major European cities don’t do better. It was smelly and kinda dirty, and I felt some weird hostile vibes as a tourist as well. The food was just decent, and none of the attractions really blew me away, other than Sagrada Familia. The public transit and walkability is *fine* but again, nothing amazing.

Visiting Portugal in the Spring. How to split up Porto and Lisbon?,"Hey All,

My wife and I are in the US, we're looking to visit Portugal next spring - preferably April, but we're flexible.  We're looking to stay 10 days or so, and the only thing we know is we'll be flying into Lisbon or Porto, and flying out of the other city. 

The biggest piece of advice I'm looking for, is how to split up the trip.  Top of my head, I was thinking 4 nights in Porto and 5 nights in Lisbon - or would 3/6 be a better split?

I'm definitely open to a lot, and would love any suggestions.  We're up for most things and trips, but if it's labor intensive (ie, hiking/biking) my wife is out.

Lisbon or Venice for Europe Trip,"Hello,

I will be going to Europe in August for the first time in my life, and will visit the UK and Southern Spain. However, I recently removed Paris from my plan due to the Olympics happening there, and am thinking to visit another city for 4 days where I will be departing from London.

Right now, I have spend hours trying to decide between Lisbon and Venice, and I still cannot decide.

On one hand, since its my first time going to Europe, I would love to visit a unique city like Venice. Also, I feel like going to Venice will make the trip a bit diverse as Venice will be completely different from the UK and Spain. However, I think I might visit Italy in the future, but it really depends on if I will ever get the time to do so.

On the other hand, Ive heard a lot of good things about Lisbon and I could get the opportunity to see most of the Iberian peninsula. Also, from watching videos of Lisbon, it sort of has a similar vibe to San Francisco with the hills and cable cars, and I loved San Francisco when I went there.

BTW, the flight cost for Venice is cheaper by 60 dollars. Also, I do understand that Venice is more expensive than Lisbon which I am totally fine with. Also, if I go to Lisbon, I would have to fly from London to Lisbon, and then fly to Barcelona since I have already booked the train tickets for Spain. 

  
I totally forgot to mention, but I do enjoy learning about history and visiting historical sites; and I understand that both cities have a rich history. 

Honestly, any advice will be much appreciated it. Im just totally lost right now.",18,82,1716803830.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d1o0rh/lisbon_or_venice_for_europe_trip/,TransferEng2020

Trying to plan a short trip to Portugal. Lisbon or Porto? Or both?,"Trying to plan out a 3-5 night trip to Portugal for the fall and cannot decide where to go!

One week trip: Madrid vs Lisbon vs Both?,"My wife and I are in the final steps of booking a weeklong trip in March. We're stuck between Lisbon or Madrid. For context we've visited Spain in the past, spending a week in Logrono and Barcelona. We also have a friend who lives in Madrid who we could definitely see if we went there and MIGHT be able to join us in Lisbon for a day or two. 

For those who have been to both, how do they compare for price, food, and ease of travel? 

Also, my wife thinks we should choose one or the other, would it be too rushed to try to split the trip between the two?

Update: Thanks everyone! After reading your firm endorsement of both cities, and also getting creative with the booking, we realized the best (and cheapest) option is to fly into Lisbon and travel by bus to Madrid and fly direct out of there. We'll likely spend more time in Lisbon, definitely hitting up some of the cities nearby.",12,58,1726838890.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1flc0nt/one_week_trip_madrid_vs_lisbon_vs_both/,tnnr
is lisbon friendly?,"it's my third day in lisbon and i'm a bit surprised at how surly most people working at pastelerias and tascas have been, because i had been told lisbon is a friendly city. 
for context i'm a 39 year old solo female traveler (asian if that matters). i smile at people and i am polite and i try my best to speak portuguese with google translate, and yeah maybe i'm butchering the language but i figured trying would be better than speaking only english.
it's honestly so disheartening to be treated this way - it doesn't even feel like indifference or bad service, it feels like they actively don't want me to be there. do they really hate tourists this much or have i just been unlucky?

edit for more context:
i'm canadian (so basically an american).
and i dont expect overly friendly, smiling people. even indifference is fine - but the people i've encountered seem actively disdainful and angry. i was expecting this from a city like paris, but had been told by multiple people that lisbon was friendly.

EDIT MORE CONTEXT: AGAIN i don't care if people aren't smiling, INDIFFERENCE AND EFFICIENCY IS FINE. but when they talk to me like they want me to leave or like i've somehow offended them (when all i've said is ""hello"" or ""table for one""), i feel disheartened.",0,47,1733051316.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1h411qu/is_lisbon_friendly/,Ok-Floor2044

Would Paris or Lisbon be a better fit for my interests?,"I've mostly traveled around Asia and haven't been to many places in Europe, so I'd like to branch out. Previously, my favorite places have been megacities, and Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taipei have been my favorite destinations so far. I really enjoyed the hustle and bustle and bright lights of their downtown areas and just walking around, soaking in the local vibe of those locations.

Things I enjoy doing include: walking around a city's downtown areas, visiting touristy landmarks, seeing local festivals and events, and, really, just wandering around aimlessly and seeing what I stumble upon.

I'm not a big partier, though and am not very interested in bars, clubs, parties, etc. I also do amateur videography as a hobby, so it'd be nice to not have to be too worried about being pickpocketed or having equipment stolen while I try to film something.

"Flying Out of Lisbon? Canadians, Your Fancy New Passport Might Screw You","Flying out of Lisbon Airport? Here’s what to expect (as of April 28, 2025)**

Just wrapped up a two-week trip to Portugal with my wife and wanted to share some up-to-date info for anyone flying out of Lisbon Airport—especially if you're Canadian.

**TL;DR**: Arrive early. Expect 3 lines. Canadian e-passports might cause issues. Line-jumping is real. Plan for chaos, hope for smooth sailing.

**Full breakdown:**

- **Arrival time**: We got there at 8:15 a.m. for an 11:15 a.m. Sunday flight. Zero line at check-in. An agent literally said, “In 30 minutes, this line will be packed with people crying.” By 9:00 a.m., the line had exploded.

- **Security**: Medium wait, about 10 minutes.

- **Passport control**: If you’re Canadian with a newer passport (the kind with the hard plastic photo page), **it won’t work** in the electronic passport scanners. I waited 20 minutes in the e-gate line before realizing this and moving to the general passport line, which had ~500 people but moved steadily—took about 30 minutes.

- **Line jumpers**: Classic European style. I counted four people cutting the line while staff at the front of the queue did nothing. Annoying, but manageable if you’ve got time.

We’re at the gate now and everything worked out, but things could have gone sideways quickly. Bottom line: **arrive early**, especially on weekends. Don’t assume the airport process will be logical—or that anyone will tell you what’s going on.

**Bonus tip**: Channel your inner Katniss—*may the odds be ever in your favor*.",0,19,1745744647.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k8zobh/flying_out_of_lisbon_canadians_your_fancy_new/,markemark1234
Lisbon Airport ,"If you are flying out of Lisbon back to America give yourself plenty of time. We arrived two hours before our flight departure (arrived at 8am and our flight was at 10am). And made it to our gate right as our zone was boarding. 

If you want food/coffee, etc I would recommended giving yourself amble time and also getting that before you go through customs. 

You will go through security and then walk through and have to go through customs/boarder control, on the other side there are places to grab food but the lines were superrr long. Each gate has their own vending machines with water, snacks.

Lisbon Airport Customs Departure Experience,"Heard about all the insane lines and waiting happening lately and figured I’d share an updated experience of DEPARTING Lisbon to fly to non-Schengen country (UK) as an EU citizen. Flew out three days ago on Friday (June 13).

If your flight is at gates S or N, you’ll need to go thru a bunch of the duty free shops to get to customs. Don’t make the mistake of waiting close to your boarding time to get to your gate in case the immigration lines are long..

Lots of E-gates are covered / being set up, but the 4 that did work were a joke. Half the folks who were eligible to go thru (only EU/EEA/CH right now) couldn’t bc the gates couldn’t read their passport at all, including mine. The assistant there said the e-gates often have issues reading passports.

I was directed to the EU line to see an agent, which was really fast anyway, only 5 minutes. My friend in the ‘All passports’ line actually got thru in 5 minutes as well. All lines were pretty short, with maybe a 5-10 min wait max.

Once you get through, you see the insane amount of people waiting to ENTER Lisbon, and this is where there don’t seem to be any e-gates. Just once massive line, so if you’re on a time crunch, you might miss your connecting flight..

Seems they’ll be opening more e-gates soon that more folks can use (set to include USA, Canada, UK..) but they don’t work well..so who knows.

"Porto, Lisbon, or Both?","Hello,

My girlfriend \[24F\] and I \[23M\] are planning a long weekend from NYC to Portugal, sometime in April or May. Given the short length of our trip (3-4 days), we're set on either doing Porto or Lisbon, or doing both (4 day trip if both). A bit about us: We both enjoy a good meal, going out to bars for some live music and socializing, and sight seeing. Also love the outdoors but don't need to include that in this trip. We are struggling with planning this because we have seen so many mixed reviews, and even a lot of bad reviews about Lisbon. Also, we don't want to be at one of these cities during the week  and have it be completely dead.

We are hoping for help with two questions...

1.) Porto, Lisbon, or both (or neither)?

2.) If both, which city should we do on the weekend? (this would be the first city we go to)

  
EDIT: I'll add that we are both pretty energetic travellers and aren't worried about over-exhaustion if we do both cities. More asking for if its worth having the full time in one city or another.

Portugal 10 days: Madeira or towns between Lisbon and Porto?,"Hi everyone!

I'm planning a family trip Mid-March and we will have 10 full days in Portugal. My son is 12. We fly in to Lisbon and fly out of Porto. We are athletic and love nature and beautiful scenery, culture, good food, cute neighborhoods. We will not be going to bars or clubs. I think it will be too cold for beaches as well. We enjoy hiking and getting immersed in the culture of a country. We usually prefer things off the beaten track that aren't super touristy.

I plan to spend 3 days in Lisbon (including a day trip to Sintra-not off the beaten track, I know but my mom wants to see it) and 2 in Porto including a trip to Coimbra. For the remaining 5 days I'm torn between visiting Madeira or traveling to the towns between Lisbon and Porto.

Madeira looks absolutely breathtaking and appeals to the outdoorsy and nature side of me. We love hiking and just enjoying nature. (For example we loved new Zealand and Maui) Whereas towns like Guimaraes, Evora, Obidos, Marfa, Cascais pique my interest in wandering around quaint neighborhoods, seeing the countryside and discovering delicious local cuisine and history.

Can anyone advise given our time frame and month of the year? Would love to hear from people who have been to both. Thank you!!",6,24,1739070446.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1il56ve/portugal_10_days_madeira_or_towns_between_lisbon/,Persimmonbear28

WIlling to spend at least a month in russia.

Georgia; Azerbaijan and Turkey: continue to exploraring, maybe cycling a bit and hiking, depending on the safety. In turkey i wish to spend at least 5 days in istambul. 

Balkans: the part of the trip im mostly looking foward to, willing to spend a long time exploring most aspects of it, former yugoslavian culture, nature, food. I also plan on spending at least 3 days in Corfu for my favorite writter lived there and i want to see it with my own eyed. Also want to visit Trieste for im a psychiatrist and Basaglia was really important in Brasil.

"Car Rental Issue - Lisbon, Portugal","A group of 4 of us rented a car from Auto Union at Lisbon Airport. We got insurance via Sunny Cars NL.

After refueling the car twice, on the third stop, on our way from Lisbon to Lagos, instead of refueling the car with Petrol (Gasolina) we confused it with Diesel (Gasoleo). We essentially filled 3/4th the tank with the incorrect fuel. Drove about 10KMs and the car started sputtering and stalling.  
We stopped on the side of the highway and tried calling for the roadside assistance that was mentioned on the rental agreement. This was around 1030 at night.

We knew that this would have to be paid for by us because we didn't opt for the roadside assistance cover. Despite this, they refused to send anyone. We clearly mentioned that we knew we'd have to pay for this service separately but all our calls ended in a ""Sorry we can't assist you"" and a hang up.

We then googled for a tow truck company and got them to tow our car to their garage and keep it there for the night at least while we figured out an alternate.

The next morning we spoke to the auto union team at Lisbon who informed us that this would cost us €615 for the fuel replacement and damage (at this point the car is not even in their possession).

We paid the money and got a replacement car from them for the remaining 3 days of our contract.

They coordinated the pickup of the car from the garage to their center. Upon returning the new car at the end of the contract, we tried enquiring about the previous car but they had no answers for us and no information. They refused to tell us the extent of the damage or the work that was done either.

They kept explaining how it was our error (which we accept) and compared it to driving the car ""willingly into a wall"" (their words not mine).

Weirdly, we saw that car, the one that we incorrectly filled Diesel in, driving out of the rental car garage at the same time we drove in. (3 days after the incident)

1. Why did their roadside assistance refuse service, considering we were willing to pay for the service?
2. Is there any chance our insurance will cover this cost? (They refuse to give us a detailed breakup of the costs)
3. Is there any way to escalate this matter if it comes to it ? Either with the rental car agency or relevant departments?
4. Surely if the car is up and running again after 3 days the damage would have been minimal? (I'm no expert), are they not bound to provide the report of work done etc.?",0,8,1748517306.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ky85ej/car_rental_issue_lisbon_portugal/,UrvTheBeatle

Lisbon/Cascais/Sintra trip- does it make sense to make Cascais our home base?,"Planning a trip to Portugal in June. We have 9 days in the country. The three major parts we want to see are Sintra (day trip), Cascais, and Lisbon. We want the flexibility in our trip to be able to spend time relaxing at pools/beaches, while also seeing the major city. Because of this, we are contemplating making Cascais our home base and choosing a nice resort to stay in that area, and traveling to Sintra/Lisbon from there. 

We’d want to do 2-3 days in Lisbon, a day in Sintra, and the rest of the time in Cascais, mainly because it seems central to all spots and we can relax a bit. It also gives us flexibility if we do decide we want to relax one day, we’re not stuck in such a city atmosphere. Does it make sense to stay at a resort in Cascais the whole time, or would you say it’s necessary to spend a couple nights in a hotel in Lisbon? From what I can tell, the train from Cascais to Lisbon is about 45 minutes, so I don’t think it would be a problem to do this a couple of separate times.

Cartagena or Lisbon for November intergenerational family trip? Other similar priced suggestions welcome,"Hello,

I'm a (not native) Spanish-speaker who has traveled just fine solo internationally, and with my dad and family to Dominican Republic. I'm planning my 40th and would like to travel with my family for around a week. I'm looking for a place not too far max 16ish hr flight (so that takes out SE Asia), and I'd prefer Spanish speaking. We've been all over the (northern) Caribbean, so I'd like something a little different. For reference, I've been to Belize, Costa Rica, DR, Ivory Coast and Spain so looking for something new. I'd like a place chill enough to not ""scare"" or overload my mom who is pretty chill, so that (in my mind) eliminates the major cities in Brazil and also Medellin or Barranquilla Columbia.

I've heard great things about Portugal as a whole, and I'm looking for a place with enough to keep us just busy enough for a week but also insulated, so to speak. I'm thinking the walled city supplemented w trips to the islands might keep us engaged for a week, but also wondering about hopping around Lisbon and Porto for a week. I can learn some basic Portuguese by November but I'm wondering how people have found it getting around/commuting as a non native speaker and with a kids/older parents. My daughter is 6 and parents in their 70 and somewhat mobile. Edited to add: I'm Black and so I'm also looking for a place that is friendly and welcoming to all. In my mind and based on what I've heard that takes out Argentina.

Lisbon Ideas for Senior Citizens?,"Hello all.

I’m a seasoned solo traveller, but I‘m trying to organize a surprise trip to Lisbon for my retired parents (I will be going with them!) 

I have the flights booked and the AirBNBs narrowed down (direct with TAP, likely accommodation area is between Avenida and Restaurades Metros?) We will be there in the late Fall; I’m not too worried about weather as it gets quite cold here so Lisbon will much warmer (even if it is rainy!)

Portugal is on both their lists - my mom from watching Phil Rosenthal on Netflix, and my dad wants to see Nazaré. They‘re also Catholics so we‘ll do Fatimà. I imagine we will only stay within Lisbon apart from the day trip to Nazaré, 

I am trying to book as much things as I can prior to gifting this (within reason - as there maybe things they want to see in Lisbon I know nothing about, but also try to avoid them trying to pay for stuff that’s not narrowed down) while also keeping in mind a few things. My mother is in her mid-70s but quite mobile and active; my dad is in his mid-late 60s and… less active. I‘m not as concerned about my mom being unable to handle the cobblestone / tiled paths but I’m noticing my dad has a slightly off gait so I’m trying to narrow down things that aren’t requiring a lot of walking. 

I will also appreciate mid-day breaks so giving leeway for rest times is in the rough agenda.

I have the Bolt app, so ordering Bolts where needed is something I’m prepped for. I’ve mentally noted a few food spots, and expect I may have some hours to kill solo if they want to take a rest while I shop or something, but I really want to see if anyone has tips on some inactive activities that could be added to the list. I‘d love to do a daytrip to Cascais, but I think that‘d be too optimistic and imagine we will stay put in Lisbon. 

So far I have the following, but I intend to gift a package between next week and Father‘s Day depending on how organized I can be. 

- Tagus River Cruise
- 48-Hour Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour (I‘m not a fan but they love these. And one of the Hop On stops is a 4 min walk from the accommodations). 
- Private Day Trip to Nazaré / Fatimà (Also a five minute walk to the meeting point.) 
- Military History Museum 
- Banksy Museum (I can‘t see my dad coming with, but my mom would enjoy going)

7 days in Portugal - Stay in Lisbon or add Porto/Algarve?,"We’re visiting Portugal for the first time this July and will have 7 days and 6 nights (though we leave early on the last day, so realistically 5-6 full days).

We love city trips, so Porto seems like a great fit, but we’re open to Algarve if it offers something ✨special✨

Given our limited time, would you recommend adding one of these destinations, or would we be better off exploring Lisbon and nearby places like Sintra and Cascais?
For those who have been, does it make sense to split time between Lisbon and Porto/Algarve, or would it feel rushed? If we do go for a second destination, which one would you recommend? Also, how’s the July heat in these places?

10 days in portugal - a review ,"Trip update: Lisbon > Lagos > Porto from 9/14 to 9/25

AMAZING trip and I’m glad we kept our itinerary and didn’t cut stops (per feedback from an itinerary check I did pre-trip). It was a great first trip / intro to Portugal and absolutely want to come back. 

Things we did and places / meals we tried that I cannot stop raving about:

Lisbon sights:
- [ ] Just wandering around Alfama was super fun
- [ ] Walking down the streets to the Praça de Comercio was fun, we grabbed bottles of wine and watched the sunset. There’s a gent building a rock village that was cool to watch 
- [ ] Belém tower is gorgeous 
- [ ] Monastery dos Jeronimos was closed since we went on a Monday but got to walk around the outside and architecture was beautiful 
- [ ] Miradouro da Senhora do Monte was a free and gorgeous lookout point of Lisbon. Amazing vista of the city
- [ ] Walked from the lookout to Castelo de S. Jorge. Cool to walk around the castle ruins. Also really great views of the city. if you can, time it so you’re there to watch the sunset from their lookout point or in the many towers 

Lisbon eats:
- [ ] Pasteis de nata, had at least one everyday and they are divine 
- [ ] Pateo - Bairro do Avillez - dinner our first night and was excited bc chef has a Michelin star. Really enjoyed it in the moment but looking back, it was our most expensive meal of the trip (still affordable compared to states) but I think we’ve had more authentic meals since. Still a cool experience and ambiance was nice. 
- [ ] Pateo 13 in alfama - recommended by a friend and cash only seafood. Whole sea bass we had was good but was expecting more street food vibes 
- [ ] Da Prata 52 - favorite meal in Lisbon. Amazing Portuguese tapas place with really fun service. 
- [ ] O Castica - laid back but very good food. Shrimp, paella and seafood pasta. 

Sintra day trip
Unfortunately most of the sites were closed due to risk of wild fires so we went to the only two that were open: Biester palace and the national palace. Both were fine but nothing in comparison to wanting to see Peña palace and the Moorish Castle but will just have to come back on another trip!
Had lunch at Romario de Baco and it was fun. Checked out some of their stores and stalls before taking the train back, which was super painless.

Lagos:
Omg I did not expect to love but the vibes are so chill and laid back after the hustle and bustle of Lisbon! 

Lagos sites:
- [ ] Do a cave boat tour, so fun to everything from the water. Recommend going in the morning during low tide so you don’t miss out on caves 
- [ ] Praia do Camilo - it’s 229 steps down to the beach (don’t forget the climb up) but so worth it! We went there two days in a row and were there 10 AM in time for low tide and there when high tide came in. Water is beautiful and sand if soft
- [ ] walk the boardwalk from town to the lighthouse and Ponta da Piedade

Lagos eats:
- [ ] Alma Lusa - absolutely get the octopus rice, I’m still thinking about that dish. The codfish is delicious (be sure to mix in the cured egg yolk), the sea bass was good and buttery, the mussels were delicious and their grilled octopus was divine
- [ ] Restaurante Prato Cheio - get the pork and clams cataplana. The pork was so tender and the seafood was delicious. Hubby got the mixed fish cataplana and enjoyed it
- [ ] O Camilo - please make a reso whether lunch or dinner otherwise you won’t get in. The grilled octopus was prob my fave of the trip. The squid was equally fresh and delicious, oysters were nice and briny, and garlic shrimp was amazing. 
- [ ] Repolho Gastrobar & Garrafeira Lagos - had a late lunch so did a lighter tapas only dinner here. The octopus pataniscas, shrimp, peri peri wings and spicy chorizo were pretty solid. 

Porto:
Did not expect to love Porto since it was so foggy and dreary when we landed. Actually, while we were there, most mornings started out that way but ended up clearing up and getting warm by lunchtime. 

Porto things:
- [ ] Day trip to Douro valley was so worth it and fun. Our guide Tiago was amazing and we visited a taberna for breakfast, three wineries (d’origem, somewhere in Sabrosa and somewhere in Pinhão), a boat tour on the river and lunch. Bought a bottle of 20 year tawny port at our last stop
- [ ] Walking around Ribeiro neighborhood was fun
- [ ] Mercado de Bolhão- fun to walk around with a glass of wine and check out the stalls 
- [ ] Wandering by the river and taking the bridge to the other side was fun. Came upon some cool shops, port tasting and vendors by the river 

Porto eats:
- [ ] Gazela to try the OG Portuguese hot dog the cachorrino 
- [ ] Taberna dos Mercadores - 1.5 hr wait in line and that’s with standing in line 20 mins before they opened. But the octopus rice, salted sea bass, shrimp were all an amazing.
- [ ] Mercado de bolhao - got amazing uni, seafood, meats and cheese while walking around. Wished we found this gem sooner
- [ ] Shiko - amazing Japanese food with fresh seafood. Ceviche - this will live rent free in my head forever. Salmon tataki- solid reco by Pedro and cuts were generous and oh so buttery. Tuna akami roll - great cuts. Unagi - nice and lightly seared. Sashimi - nice cuts of tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Turbot - interested in trying pieces we don't get in the states but this was not my fave
- [ ] Potts and combi for coffee and natas 

Could not even choose a favorite stop if we tried bc every place had its own vibes. Loved Portugal and glad we got to see as much as possible! ",2593,114,1728606712.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g0xhh0,keke1486

Porto and Lisbon in 4 days? Too enthusiastic?,"We originally planned to go just to Lisbon, arriving Saturday morning and leaving Tuesday. 

However both our flights are 7+hours with layovers, from the other side of Europe 🤣

So I had a stupid idea that might be genius- fly into Porto and leave from Lisbon, we could afford to have one extra night but not much more,

The plan would be as follows- arrive in Porto at 11:30 am on Saturday. Spend two days there

On Mondays morning (or maybe Sunday evening) take the train to Lisbon, spend Monday and Tuesday there and then on Wednesday 1pm leave for home.

Is it too tight of a schedule? Are we missing out on the real experience in both by trying to jam it all into 4 days?

Also- is nightlife better  in Lisbon or Porto? We were thinking of starting in Porto since it’s smaller and therefore leaving Monday and Tuesday evening for Lisbon? Since it’s a bigger city then still more people going out during the week

8 Days in Portugal -> Start and End In Lisbon,"Hello Everyone. I was fortunate enough to have an unexpected visit (only the afternoon) to Porto a few months ago and absolutely loved the city and people. I was on a business trip at the time, but vowed to bring my family. (Wife and 2 college age daughters).

Fortunately, my airline tickets are now booked for Lisbon (Land & Depart) for early June (arriving on a Tuesday). I will start and end in Lisbon, but will have 8 days between flights to explore Portugal. My initial plan is to land and drive a rental car towards Porto where we will spend a few days and then make are way down towards the Faro area. I plan to return to Lisbon the morning prior to my flight.

Since we are landing from a long flight, I would like to know if there is a suggested overnight village enroute to Porto. Maybe a fun walk in town or coastal area for the family? The next morning, I would continue to Porto for at least 1 night, maybe 2.

After Porto, plan would be head towards the Faro area (or looking on suggestion on where you would stay). My girls are blown away over the beauty of the coastal area (from pictures only) and want to experience it first hand. Any suggestions on sights or lodging would be much appreciated. I'm open to airbnb apartment or nicer hotel that may fit a family of 4.

We will end in Lisbon the night prior to my flight home. In total we have 8 full days in Portugal to explore this amazing country.

\*\*\* I know crowds will likely be high, but would appreciate if any suggestions of beautiful areas that may be less busy. Lastly, the cities above are my thoughts, but open to other locations since we will have a car for the week.

Meanwhile “cheap” cities like Istanbul now charge $30-50 for each of their Top 10 landmarks, so visiting Basilica Cistern, Galata Tower, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi in just one day is going to cost $150 per person.

Barcelona is also considered a “cheap city” because food and walking around is cheap, but hotels seem very pricey and every attraction was a $$$ pit. Even smaller places that took only an hour or so: €25 for Casa Mila, €35 for Casa Batllo, etc.

I will be visiting Lisbon soon on a trip with my boyfriend, and we were looking at spots either in Chiado or Principe Real (near the botanical garden) to stay! From locals and/or people who have visited many times, would you choose one place versus the other? 

I think Chiado is more central to tourist spots we will be visiting, but also more expensive. Would staying in Principe Real be out of the way/inconvenient? Any advice is appreciated!

Solo travel to Lisbon,"Solo Visit to Portugal

Hi everyone,  
Looking for some advice on a 5-day solo trip to Portugal. I’ve done a fair bit of research and read through this subreddit, but wanted to get insights from those who’ve traveled solo in Portugal.

I’ll be in Lisbon for work and have 4 full days plus a half-day to explore. Lisbon will be my base and departure point. Based on what I’ve read, Lisbon, Porto, and nearby areas seem ideal—though Madeira also looks interesting (still need to research if it’s worth the trip with limited time).

I enjoy national parks, hiking, city exploration, and a bit of history. I don’t drink much (occasional wine is fine) and I’m not into water activities, though a beach afternoon sounds nice.

My tentative plan:

* Half-day (post-conference): Fly to Porto, explore, nice dinner
* Day 2: Day trip to Douro Valley, then explore more of Porto
* Day 3: Fly back to Lisbon, city tour
* Day 4: Day trip to Sintra, return to Lisbon and explore more
* Day 5: Fly home

I’m also considering swapping Porto for Madeira, but not sure if it’s practical. Appreciate any tips or itinerary suggestions!",1,1,1747675998.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kqhqy3/solo_travel_to_lisbon/,zippoflames

"9 day trip through Barcelona, Porto and Lisbon Itinerary","Thanks to reddit-induced anxiety I've swapped itineraries around a bit. Currently sticking to mainly Portugal with some brief time in Barcelona this March. 
How does this look so far?

My main uncertainty currently is the 12th/13th, hoping to include Coimbra and sacrificing a little time in Porto/Lisbon to do so. 
There are so many amazing sites to consider and it's been difficult saying no to things (such as Madeira Island).

Land in Barcelona 1pm Saturday March 8th.
8th: Mercado, Tapas, Gothic Quarter/Gaudi Cathedral

9th: 1/2 day trip to Montesserat, Gothic Quarter/Gaudi
we aren't inclined to go to museums or buy tourist sight-seeing tickets etc. just happy to be in the city, walk around, see beautiful things and eat good food.


Land in Porto 2pm Monday March 10th.
(wanting to be in Porto during the week, hoping it's less touristy than the late week/weekend?)
10th: settle in, walk along the river front, Livraria Lello if possible, Sunset view, Pastel de Nata + dinner

11th: Duoro Valley (I don't drink alcohol however would still like to see!)

12th: Livraria Lello if missed, head to Coimbra to see the University Library (thermal baths if possible)Stay in Coimbra? Porto? Head to Lisbon after?


13th: Depart from Porto or Coimbra to Lisbon if not there already. Check out LX Factory, viewpoint or walk around, dinner

14th: Sintra: not intersted in going into Pena Palace but wouldn't mind the beautiful hike up there, I heard the Moorish castles are very nice to see
Happy to skip/see Pena Palace from a distance and head to other spots

15th: Alfama neighborhood, check various viewpoints, dinner, evening jazz

16th: head back to Barcelona, relax, beach? gift shopping, dinner before flight

17th: flight at 11:30am from Barcelona to the States


EDIT: to add that we are doing Barcelona because we booked flights in/out of Barcelona. It wasn’t thought out well because going was an impulse decision to begin with (not sure if you’re interested to know that long story). 
One of the people traveling in our group has a lifelong wish of going to Lisbon and it gradually turned into a Portugal trip from that point. 
So yes, in hindsight, it would have been wiser to fly in/out of Portugal however the flights are non-refundable. It’s an inconvenient situation but I’d like to make the most of it.

Flights to Porto for me are way cheaper than directly to Lisbon, so we're hoping to stay in Porto the whole time, with a day trip to Lisbon at some point, as I'm aware there's a bus that goes from Porto to Lisbon in the mornings and is just 3 hours long.

I was also wondering what a good rough estimate for cost per day per person would be for Porto/Lisbon? As well as what are some good areas to stay in? Also, is Porto a good place to be for a group of people that would prefer to do moderate levels of walking? my parents don't mind walking, but can only do so much without breaks in between.

Needing tips - Looking for a cheap place to stay in Lisbon,"Hey!

Back in 2022 I visited Lisbon for the first time and fell in love with the city. From the moment I left I knew I want to come back. In April I'm gonna stsrt taking portugese classes as well.
Now I want to visit Lisbon again for 2-3 weeks and working remote from there. It was always my dream to work abroad and I want to test it out for a short amount to test out if it is a lifestyle for me.
I already searched for places to stay but I was a bit shocked about the prices. For context, I am still in university and want to visit during the break between two semesters. So, money is tight.

I preferably live somewhere where I can cook for myself to save money. I think I have max 500€ as  budget. I don't need to live in the city itself, I am totally fine to travel ~60-70mins to get into the city by public transport. But the prices for the public transport shouldn't cost a fortune (like it would be the same price to live in the city itself).

Maybe you have some tips for cheap places to stay, no matter if a whole flat for yourself, a hotel, a room. I just don't feel comfortable in a shared bedroom. Right now I feel a bit delusional finding something for that tight budget and I hope you have some positive news for me. :)",0,12,1739413963.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1io8w9w/needing_tips_looking_for_a_cheap_place_to_stay_in/,Typical_Method4390
Athens vs Lisbon in August,"Hi, my fiancée and I are considering between Athens and Lisbon for our honeymoon in August.

Any words of advice for us?

Layover between flight into Lisbon and train out of Oriente Station,"Hello, I have a trip to Portugal coming up. We arrive at the Lisbon airport at 10:45am and have a train out of Oriente at 2:02pm.

Lisbon nightime layover,"**Hey everyone! Quick question about a Lisbon layover 🛬🌙**

My flight got canceled and the rebooking gave me a nighttime layover in Lisbon — we land around **21:10** and depart the next day at **11:50**. I was wondering if it’s worth trying to explore a bit or if we should just crash at a hotel. Specifically:

• Are there any **restaurants or areas open after 10pm** that you’d recommend?

• Is it **safe to be out and about at night** near the airport or in the city?

• Are there any **cool spots nearby** that are easy to get to for a late dinner or quick walk?

Appreciate any tips! Just trying to make the most of the stop without making it overly complicated 😅

Does anyone have any recommendations for specific foods/restaurants/drinks we should try in Lisbon?

Question about travelling from Lisbon to the UK!,"I am from the UK and spending a few days in Lisbon this week. I am flying back home on Friday, and am a little bit anxious about navigating the airport as I've read worrying things about Lisbon's.

My flight will be departing from Terminal 1, and I'll be checking in online beforehand, and without hold luggage, just a carry-on.

Am I right in thinking that after making my way through security, I then have to go through passport control before getting to my gate? And if so, can I just go straight to passport control from security, or do I have to wait for my gate to be announced first? I'd much rather get there early and get the queueing out of the way rather than having to risk waiting for a gate announcement then queueing for passport control 30 minutes before my flight. 

The airline I'm flying with has said they're expecting a lot of passengers through Lisbon airport on Friday so to turn up with extra time and I'm very nervous about missing my flight!

2025 Vacation: Belize vs Azores/Lisbon,"My girlfriend are deciding on a vacation for August/September timeframe, and we are deciding on Belize vs Azores/Lisbon. Curious for people’s thoughts. 

We will be flying from Washington DC.

Some considerations:

1. Azores seems to be great weather wise throughout August and September. For Belize, we see rainy season kicks into full gear in September. But a lot of what I’ve read online is that it isn’t a showstopper, and can be quite pretty.

2. If we do Azores, plan is to fly to Lisbon for 2 days (thoughts on that amount of time in Lisbon?) In Lisbon, walk around, eat good food, see sights. For Azores, I’m having trouble deciding which islands we’d want to visit (because they all look great….)

3. We both like to get outside and get in nature. We would do some beach lounging, but not all day every day. Far from it. Azores seems like it’s most definitely NOT beach vacation type place, although there are some beautiful beaches there. Belize has some beautiful beaches.

4. For Belize, it seems like we’d do snorkeling and kayaking excursions, as well as maybe a day fishing trip (we love to fish). We’d also do a jungle stay and do the famous ATM cave as well as some jungle eco tours. 

5. For Azores, do a lot of hiking and walks. Scenic viewing. Visit natural beauty landmarks. Do some ocean kayaking perhaps. I found some tour providers.

6. We are both adventurous eaters and love seafood. I think both seem like great locations for food. At the risk of sounding ignorant, I’ve seen a lot of comments on Reddit that people underestimate the food in Belize.

So what are your thoughts?",2,7,1738423641.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1if8ntw/2025_vacation_belize_vs_azoreslisbon/,Rtstevie

The worst people experience in Lisbon,"I (29f, PoC) travel a lot. I recently went to a solo Europe trip. I am sad to say that out of all the travelling I have ever done, I had the worst experience with people in Lisbon. Overall the trip was great. I stayed there for a week and loved the city and its food. also not all the people I encountered were bad. Those in the tourist industry and most young people were great. However, I am sharing my experience so others will be aware. 

\- I went into a sunglass shop which was very big. tried a sunglass I liked but changed my mind. kept it where it originally was and went to the 2nd floor to check more. a female shop assistant came running behind me shouting at me saying that I should give the sunglass back. I took her downstairs and showed her that the sunglass was right there. she didn't even apologize.

\- I observed that whenever in a crowded bus or train, if my hand bag would, by mistake, touch any old person, they would immediately wipe their skin with sanitiser. 

\- I received unwanted touching from middle aged male waiters, like rubbing my arm or my back if I drank more than one alcoholic drink. they would think that I might be drunk and it is okay to do so since I was eating alone.

\- One time, at the Rossio train station, the machine that top ups travel card was out of order. I had just arrived in Lisbon from Sintra by train and needed to take a bus back to my airbnb. I had no idea if the buses accept cash so I went to the help desk. when I asked the man at the desk if I can pay buses by cash, he got angry and said to me if I see him working in a train station or bus station? and I should never again ask such stupid questions since he works at a train station and not a bus station.

These are just a few instances from what micro aggressions I experienced over there daily. I did not face anything near this in any other country I visited on that Europe tour. Sadly to say I might never again visit the city.",25,54,1690008596.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/156cnl8/the_worst_people_experience_in_lisbon/,rebelliousrabbit

We would probably fly in through Paris and spend one or two nights, then move on to our final destination. That will leave us about 4-5 nights.

"14 Days: Porto, Lisbon, Seville?, Madrid - itinerary for Feb 2025","Hi all, 

I’m visiting Portugal and Spain for the first time next month! Will be traveling by public transit. I love art, good food, being active, hikes, seafood, pastries, street eats, scenic views, and live music. Yeah I love food :D I'm not into partying or nightlife, though drinks are aight.

Day 1: Porto — landing at around lunch time

Day 2: Porto (Douro Valley)

Day 3: Porto (Guimaraes / Braga)

Day 4: Porto

Day 5: Porto > Lisbon — early train

Day 6: Lisbon on a Monday

Day 7: Lisbon (Sintra)

Day 8: Lisbon (Cascais)

Day 9: Lisbon > Seville by plane

Day 10: Seville

Day 11: Seville > Madrid — late train (\*\*may switch earlier, for safety)

Day 12: Madrid on a Sunday

Day 13: Madrid

Day 14: Getting to the airport

My tickets are booked for Porto and Madrid already. I considered extending my trip but realised I'm unlikely to be doing day trips in Madrid after 1+ week of transfers and travel. My interest in Madrid is the art museums.

All in all, I have 3.5 full days in Porto, 4 days in Lisbon, 1+0.5+0.5 days in Seville, and 2 days in Madrid. Ideally, I'm trying to go for mid-paced, but not bored. Let me know what think! :)

**Questions:**

1. **Day 4**: I’m thinking whether to split Braga / Guimaraes, do Coimbra, do a walking tour in Porto, or add a day to Lisbon instead.
2. **Day 9**: Must fly out of Lisbon on Day 9 due to flight schedules. Am open to changing my flight for Madrid. Ambivalent on Seville - not sure how I feel about the key attractions of Real Alcazar and Cathedral, but heard Seville's worth the visit for a different vibe from Madrid. What do you think? Seville, Lisbon, or Madrid for Fri / Sat?
3. **Picking Attractions**: I got all-templed-out in Japan and Cambodia haha. Am thinking of doing one to two of each attraction across all the places I’m visiting - e.g. palace, garden, art museum, bookstore?, church/cathedral, ruins. Which would be your picks? For example, Real Alcazar or Royal Palace or both?",4,4,1737786183.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i9gw01/14_days_porto_lisbon_seville_madrid_itinerary_for/,pickpiccolo
"9 days in Porto, Lisbon, and Sintra- itinerary advice","Hi there. I’m visiting Portugal early March and I am looking for some feedback on my itinerary. I only have 9 days, so hoping to make the most of it! Only things that are booked is my flight into Porto and out of Lisbon, the Duoro Valley hotel mid-trip, and the hostel in Lisbon at the tail end of the trip. 

I’m a pretty outdoorsy person, so a big highlight to me would be to go to Cabo da Roca and the coastal region near Sintra, but logistically I’m not sure how to get there with my itinerary. I’m open to renting a car, but not totally sure what the best way to go about that would be. 

Also open to any suggestions. I’m in my late 20s, and enjoy food and drink, immersing into the culture, good views, nature. 
Castles and church sightseeing is nice but not as large of a priority. 

Day 1- arrive into Porto in the evening. Dinner and check into hotel 

Day 2: explore Porto 

Day 3: explore Porto 

Day 4: Porto to Duoro Valley via train. Wine tastings and what not. Stay in Duoro Valley for one night 

QDay 4: Duoro Valley back to Porto in the afternoon. Ideally, I would have loved to go skip Porto and continue on with the trip, but without a car it seems like the best bet is to break up the travel time to Sintra/Lisbon by going back to Porto for the night. 

Day 5: Porto to ?Sintra to Colares? This is where I’m not too sure. I really really would love to spend some time in the coastal region of Calores (great Airbnbs available too). But also without a car this seems difficult. Should I rent a car in Porto? 

Day 6: Colares to Sintra then Lisbon 

Day 7: Lisbon 
 
Day 8: Lisbon 

Day 9: fly out of Lisbon in the AM

Thoughts? Any tips are welcomed! Thank you all!

Lisbon/Porto 8-Day Spring Itinerary & Questions,"My family (parents & 18 year old daughter) are taking our first European vacation this Spring to Portugal. We have airfare booked roundtrip to Lisbon and have been researching what we'd like to do and see. I'm so anxious to have a good first travel experience! We are mostly interested in art, culture, history, beautiful views, quirky museums, and unique adventures. We are not drinkers or interested in bars/nightlife. We are relatively healthy but everyone has a bum knee, or weak ankles, or a bad back so we will need some rest time after long excursions. We will not have a car and plan to use public transportation or ride shares.

Possible itinerary so far is:

* Day 1 - WED - Arrive Lisbon airport at 10am after 19 hours of flights and layovers. Check into hotel. Start at **Time-Out Market** to eat and make our way to the **Baxia** historic neighborhood, explore on foot and ride the trams - basically try to make the most of the day while jet-lagged. 

* Day 2 - THU - Spend a day in **Belem** \- see **Belem Tower**, **Padrao dos Descobrimentos**, **Coach Museum**, **Quake Museum**, **Mosteiro dos Jeronimos**, **Museu de Marinha**. 

* Day 3 - FRI - Day trip to **Sintra. Palace of Pena, Castelo dos Mouros, Quinta da Regaleira, Palace of Monserrate** and maybe visit the **NewsMuseum** for a change of pace.

* Day 4 - SAT - Tour of **National Tile Museum** and **Tile Making Workshop**

* Day 5 - SUN - Morning train to **Porto -** check into hotel**. Porto Walking Tour, Lello Bookshop,  Sao Bento Railway Station, River Cruise and Cable Car. Casa São Roque Art Center?** 

* Day 6 - MON - Day trip tour to **Aveiro Canals, Paiva Walkways, Arouca Suspension Bridge, Costa Nova**

* Day 7 - TUE - **Braga and Guimaraes Day Trip**

* Day 8 - WED - Return Train to Lisbon - check into hotel near airport. **Gulbenkian Museum, Parque Eduardo VI**

* Day 9 - THU - Depart Lisbon @ 10am

Does this seem doable? Are we missing out on any must-see landmarks? Evora looks amazing but doesn't fit into this itinerary at all. 

There's so much to see and our only day for exploring Lisbon center is the first day and we might be exhausted from traveling. 

Should we skip the Porto move altogether and just stay in and around Lisbon? We are really excited about the Aveiro/Paiva/Arouca day trip from Porto, but staying just in Lisbon would simplify everything and allow for more downtime and flexibility.

LISBON turist questions,"I'm traveling to Lisbon in March and have a few questions:

* After reading various forum posts, I'm not sure which areas are considered safe and which are not. We’re looking at accommodation near Jardim Dom Luís park, by the Time Out Market. Is it safe to walk around here at night, especially towards Pink Street or further down near the train station?
* I've read that many tourists encounter suspicious individuals offering drugs. What should we do in this situation? Are they aggressive? Where are they most commonly found?
* Outside of Lisbon, we’re planning to visit Sintra, Cabo da Roca, Cascais, and Nazaré. This seems like too much for one day—would it be better to split it into two? Would it make sense to stay somewhere along the way or return to Lisbon and visit the other locations on a different day?
* Any specific safety tips? Are tuk-tuk rides safe?
* What are the temperatures like in early March? Is a winter jacket needed, or are lighter spring clothes enough?

Traveling is not the same experience for women as it for men and it's insane what women face around the world,"Anyone who thinks traveling (or just traveling and honestly just existing) for women isn't hard - I urge you to think about the millions of women who face harassment. I myself have been either sexually assaulted, harassed, groped, catcalled heavily or followed in: Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Waterloo, London, Lisbon, Rome, and Naples. I was recently assaulted in Naples and posted about it to let people (esp women) know what can happen and instead I received messages from tons of men telling me I'm ""playing a sad victim"" and that I'm crying about it (I was literally hugged, groped, and kissed today by a total stranger on the street while walking)

It's not easy being a woman and still enjoying things worry free like men can and it sucks we've created a culture and a world where this is prevalent. I'm not saying men don't have to be worried about solo travelling, but women have to be worried about everything men do AND assault on top of that. It's to the point where I can't even go out at night when I have paid to travel to cities, or go to famous landmarks, or bars/clubs, or even take public transport at night. 

On top of that, things like pepper spray and such are illegal in so many countries and harming the other person (as self defence) may even result in the woman being punished if the law deems so. But we need to understand that women cannot defend themselves like men can in situations such as being attacked. We are simply not that strong physically. I know for a fact that I and many other women cannot get a man off us if we tried to. So why are we expecting the same ""self defense"" efforts from men and women? Knowing that using a pepper spray will get me in trouble with the law but the man who raped me can walk away if proven innocent blows my mind. 

I'm tired of following endless precautions yet still being targeted for things like this and assaulted. People are always blaming women too like ""oh you must've dressed wrong"" or ""you must have smiled at him"" and if not blaming women, people will only be giving tips out on what women can do to make sure that they are not assaulted. But WHY are we pinning everything on women and making it their responsibility? Why can't we teach guys that this is not okay by having stringent laws and punishments and just realizing the human factor when it comes to making laws regarding ""self defense"" because unfortunately, women are physically weaker.

I'm tired of hearing that ""this is the culture with [ ] men"" or that my clothes made it seem like ""I wanted it"". Traveling and just this world seems unfair for women and men need to acknowledge their privilege and advocate for changes too. It isn't cool if your buddy assaults me and then you just laugh as if it wasn't a big deal. It isn't cool for you to say that I just shouldn't travel if it's like this. It isn't cool for you to assume that anything I did caused this. ",2859,97,1714610632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ci2ddg/traveling_is_not_the_same_experience_for_women_as/,xrshxa

"Query about Hostels in Lisbon, Portugal in July 2025","Hi,

Going to a music festival in Portugal mid-July next year and looking to party a bit in Lisbon in the days leading up to the festival kicking off.

I have had a few hostels recommended to me but it seems as though for that time period nothing is taking bookings yet, is exorbitantly expensive comparatively to when I travelled to Lisbon in 2023 (200% price increase) or is already sold out. 

Is there a reason hostels would limit what is on the market 8 months out? Am I simply looking to book things too early? Are prices inflated for a reason? Are they likely to come down? How far in advance is the best time to book to get the best value for money?

TAP Air Dublin - Cancun with connecting flight in Lisbon,"Hello,

Has anyone traveled recently on that route? Dublin - Lisbon - Cancun - Lisbon - Dublin ?

I would like to know if I would have to re-enter the terminal and do another security check in Lisbon while coming back to Dublin. I only have a hand luggage so that limits my option of purchasing anything for my travel back risking it will be confiscated in Lisbon. I would like to mostly hear from people who actually traveled recently with that airline and were landing in Terminal 1 and departing from Terminal 1.

Historically, 90% of the time I have been kicked out of the terminal and forced to re-enter and I assume It's because Ireland is not in Schengen. But also, I often have had connecting flight from different Terminals and they are hardly connected together. 

Could anyone please advise? :)

Lisbon and Marrakech reflections / tips,"Hi team, my husband and I have just spent a  week across Lisbon and Marrakech and benefited from a lot of the tips here so thought we’d share some of our own reflections. 

Lisbon is well covered here so won’t repeat all the great advice already on this sub. With  the exceptions of:
  

- We went in late August and it was not only HOT but the UV was intense. We’re from NZ which has some of the highest UV levels in the world and am pretty used to a fierce sun but I found we had to be really vigilant with sunscreen. I saw a lot of sunburnt tourists, so if you’re fair skinned you’re going to be needing to apply sunscreen about every 1-2 hours 
- Also be aware that quite a few of the landmarks / attractions (e.g the commerce quarter, squares, and boat tours etc.) can have limited to no shade so plan that ahead
- The need to walk a lot / have good shoes is well covered but I cannot stress having shoes with good grip enough. I went out with sandals with a smooth bottom and it was literally like ice skating. 
- If you are planning on walking with your luggage (eg from metro station to hotel) I’d also recommend doing a quick street view search as there are cobbled roads everywhere which can absolutely destroy your luggage wheels. 
- Tipping is not customary but given the tourist popularity of Lisbon we got asked very directly to add a tip - just say no
- The metro is insanely easy to use, clean and efficient. I wouldn’t recommend getting into the city from the airport any other way - it costs €1.80. Only thing to note is that the airport end of the metro doesn’t open until 6:20am

  

Travel / airlines
 
- I see a lot of questions about TAP/ Portugal Air. We flew Toronto to Lisbon and I have nothing bad to say about the experience at all - was on time, friendly service etc. With that said though we were sitting in an exit row without a row in front so had ample stretch space. The rows did look really cramped so for a 7ish hour flight would not be ideal. But the price point was about half our next viable option (Air Canada).
- Similarly we also had a positive experience flying Ryanair from Lisbon to Marrakech. Flight was on time, no issues with our luggage or checking in etc. You just need to keep in mind, given the insanely cheap fares, that their business model is on getting customers with hidden fees. The things to look out for from our experience:
    - check-in: if you don’t check-in online then you’ll get charged a substantive fee at the airport. You may need to validate your passport through the app to do so. 
    - Passport validation. Even if you’re checked in you may need to separately validate your passport at the airport which will likely be in a different line to bag drop. Check what your app / boarding pass says really carefully. 
    - Baggage. These fees are insane if you’re over your allowance. We paid for a 20kg checked bag in advance and had no issues but just to be sure we used the scales before getting to the front of the line in case we needed to redistribute. I’m not sure if this is standard practice but the agent weighed our bags together for a total allowance of 40kg which is great if just one of you are a little bit over 
    - As someone with limited exposure to super budget airlines, I was fully prepared for the actual airline /flying experience but I didn’t realise this would extend to the airport. For Lisbon anyway, all budget airlines depart from the same terminal which is essentially just an open hangar. This had really limited facilities and was insanely busy. We had gotten to the airport early expecting to do normal stuff like get a bite to eat, change, charge our phones etc. which wasn’t really possible given how busy the terminal was. In the end wasn’t really an issue but would’ve been nice to know before hand. 
- I’ll cover off flying out of Marrakech on Vueling below  


  
Marrakech  
I booked Marrakech on a whim when planning our Lisbon trip purely due to the proximity. I then checked reddit and thought I’d made a massive mistake. My husband and I decided to stick with the trip given it was only a few days and it would be an “experience” no matter what. Without writing an essay the summary version is that it was absolutely fine - the “harassment” we experienced is no different to say, walking through a tourist flea market in Cancun. I absolutely do not intend to invalidate the experiences shared here but simply offer a different perspective, especially if someone is on the fence. 

  Key points I’d highlight / caveat with / give context for:  

- We (F33, M39) are Caucasian. My husband is “ethnically ambiguous” but I am very obviously a white tourist 
- We did book a tour guide the first day because I was so concerned about what we had got ourselves into. It was ultimately not needed whatsoever, but did have the benefits of a) giving us confidence that we would be fine and b) directing us to an amazing hole in the wall restaurant that many locals don’t even know about which is some of the best food I’ve ever had.
- I understand that it’s not the super busy season so maybe that has something to do with the reduced harassment? With that said from our perspective it was absolutely heaving with tourists and very busy. 
- We stayed in a Riad which I would absolutely recommend. They will generally provide a full concierge service (booking transfers, taxis, giving you directions and tips etc.) Our riad was incredible so if anyone would like to know the name let me know. 
- We did not experience any of the scams or unsafe behaviour that many have outlined here (eg the “wrong way” scam). In fact several of the hawkers genuinely tried to help us without wanting anything in return or with nefarious intent (this was actually a bit awkward as we were operating in the assumption that everyone was out to get us, so we were quite rude, ultimately to people that actually wanted to help). Some “exceptions”:
    - The most intense part we experienced was the square at night. Hawkers are REALLY pushy to get you to sit at their restaurant or buy their stuff. We didn’t have anyone touch us but they did try and block our way a few times. With that said, saying NO a few times and not otherwise engaging resulted in them giving up really quickly 
    - Some kids gave us directions and wanted money. Not a scam just trying to make a buck. 
    - Similarly, all of the products being hawked are significantly higher than what would “should” be paying (sometimes as high as 500%). If you want to get a good price you will need to haggle. Again, I don’t really see this as a “scam” but can be uncomfortable for western tourists. 
- Outside of the Medina / square we had no issues. Two random points:
    - I wore a scarf around my head and shoulders as sun protection - the tour guide immediately and emphatically asked about this to ensure it wasn’t because I was concerned about cultural offence. He said wear whatever - no issues. 
    - Alcohol is available but it is very expensive and not something you can pick up in a corner store or in the grocery in the areas in the old city. 
- One thing that is absolutely consistent is that the Marrakech airport is an utter shitshow. You will be waiting in passport security for at least 25 minutes, and you need to go through bag security multiple times. I mentioned earlier that we flew Vueling - another budget airline - from Marrakech to Paris. And again, had absolutely no issues at all in terms of the flight being on time etc. ",7,15,1725699835.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fb2q9a/lisbon_and_marrakech_reflections_tips/,Buttsecrets
Would you take a $$ Loss and cancel an international trip due to a terrible weather forecast?,"My brother was scheduled to travel to Portugal for a week-long forecast last month.  Airfare and Hotels were booked, money spent, and they were all ready to go on vacation.

They were sick of the rain and cold in Seattle and wanted to spend time in Europe in a sunny and warm place.  They wanted an outdoor vacation.  Chose Lisbon.

Then they looked at the weather forecast and saw that a massive storm with an incredible amount of rain was going to ruin their vacation.  They argued back and forth about what to do and finally decided to go anyway.  Arriving in Lisbon, they were met with a hard rain, flooding, wind, cold, and fog. The weather was beyond bad for the whole week.  The weather was ten times worse than their worst nightmare.  Awful!

They spent most of their vacation sitting in their room, hoping the next day's weather would be better. But the next day was worse.  Complete washout!

"Itinerary Critique: 2 weeks in Iberia (Madrid, Seville, Lisbon) ","Hello. My fiancée and I are trying to plan our honeymoon for the last two weeks of March. We've decided on the Iberian Peninsula because my fiancée speaks some Spanish and wants to travel somewhere she can use it, and the weather there in March seems decent. This is the first major trip we've ever really planned and we're struggling to decide where we should go and for how long, because we don't want to fall into the trap of going too many places in too short of time but we also want a good variety of experiences.

  
Below is the general itinerary. I've decided not to count days with traveling as time in either the departure or arrival city, even though a lot of the travelling shouldn't take the whole day, just to keep it simple: 

* Arrive by plane in Madrid from the US (Allotted full day)
   * Spend 3 full days in Madrid, with potential day trip to Toledo or Segovia
* 3hr train from Madrid to Seville (Allotted full day)
   * Spend 3 full days in Seville, with potential day trip to Cordoba
* Short-haul flight from Seville to Lisbon (Allotted full day)
   * Spend 3 full days in Lisbon, with potential day trip to Sintra
* Leave out of Lisbon back to US (Allotted full day)

So our questions are:

1. **Does this itinerary involve too much traveling? Do the durations we’ve planned for each location make sense?** I thought spending at least three days in each place would help balance the travel times, but I’m wondering if some destinations might need more or less time. Should we even consider cutting the trip down to just two places? I’m particularly unsure about the flight from Seville to Lisbon, it seems like there aren’t many good alternatives to flying for that jump.
2. **Would it be worth the extra travel time to replace Madrid with Barcelona?** Madrid is more convenient due to its connectivity, especially since Barcelona would add an extra three hours to the train ride to Seville. However, Barcelona feels more appealing to us, particularly because of its architecture. We're wondering if that extra travel time would be a worthwhile trade, because Madrid seems great too. 
3. **Do these cities seem like a good combination?** We chose these because they seem like they would give 3 distinct vibes while still giving a good taste of the region. Is that a good assumption? We're wondering if maybe we should choose more radically different places. ",0,7,1733187632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1h5b61h/itinerary_critique_2_weeks_in_iberia_madrid/,dumb-secret

"car rental driving from Lisbon, PT to Madrid, ES - big dropoff fee for one-way","Hi Travelers,

Planning a 3 week trip to start in Lisbon, driving north up the coast of Portugal, stopping at a number of places (Obidos, Tomar, Batalha, Coimbra, Aveiro) and then ending in Porto.  From there, driving across the Duro valley and staying in Salamanca, Segovia, Avila, Toledo and then ending in Madrid.

Needless to say, should be an epic trip and looking forward to this!  But, I do believe that driving via car on this trip is really essential.  In other trips to Europe I have sometimes found that these spontaneous trips in the country are the highlight (did this last year in Dordogne, France was amazing for this sort of trip).  Only need the car for 2 out of the 3 weeks on the Iberian peninsula, since days in the cities of Lisbon and Madrid we will not need it.

I noticed that doing a one-way picking up rental car in PT and dropping off in ES is not super straightforward.  National does not allow it at all.  Hertz DOES allow it (and, I currently made that reservation already but can always cancel) but they charge a 750 EU fee for doing the one way drop off.  Total for 2 weeks of car is 1900 EU for a compact car, which is not terrible but it just really hurts to have that 750 EU fee for no obvious reason.

I was wondering if others might have advice on this?  For example, should I try to do 2 separate car rentals (one in PT, different on in ES) to avoid this fee?  But, in which case, should I try to do a ""border crossing"" for that second pickup?  That doesn't sound convenient and might run the risk of just wasting alot of time.

Anyone else out there run into this particular issue?

Thanks for any advice

Edit: corrected total car rental price to 1900 EU

  
UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the very helpful comments.  By breaking it up into two separate one-way rentals (Lisbon->Porto, then catch a ride to Vigo, Spain and do Vigo->Madris) the total cost through Hertz was 950 EU as opposed to 1900 EU for the exact same model of car and exact same number of days.  That is quite a cost savings, for what is only an additional 2-3 hrs spent on the extra leg to cross the border!",0,16,1722803654.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ek567t/car_rental_driving_from_lisbon_pt_to_madrid_es/,groguthegreatest

What is the best city you have been in Europe and the worst??,"I would love to get a thread started everyone talking about their experiences in their favourite city in Europe and their least favourite city. I will start...

My least favourite city I have been to in Europe has got to be podgorica in montenegro! (sorry) found it pretty soulless to be honest.

My favourite I have two (cheating) hear me out.

1. Sarajevo. Was only in Sarajevo for one day and stayed overnight and it was awesome. Really charming city and full of soul as well.sarajevo was alot bigger than I thought it would be and the city centre has a really nice modern area.

2. Budapest. Me and my partner went to Budapest in February for a week and we really loved the city. Great people we met there.enjoyed learning the basics of the language too!! (hard!!) beautiful architecture and the city pretty big as well. Plenty to do!!

Places we plan to visit and have interest in ( Kiev, Moscow, Belgrade,  Minsk, St Petersburg.)

Lisbon - Early Stage Itinerary Check - Travel with Toddlers,"Howdy,

Just at the early stages of planning, seeing what people's opinion are of this 7 day trip with toddlers. I feel its too cramped for a 7 day trip with travelling other cities, but I see so many people recommending on going, plus one of those ""do it since you're already there"".

The trip includes a 3yo and a 2yo.

\- Don't like the additional 3hr travelling once landing in Lisbon after 8hr flight, but it makes the most sense in terms of planning (so I think)

\- Think I am losing too much time with commuting, or definitely should squeeze in Porto and Sintra?

**> Day 1**

Arrive 9am Lisbon

Travel to Porto until Day 3

\> **Day 4 until Day 7**

Return to Lisbon - This gives me 3 days to explore Lisbon, one day which would essentially be reserved almost entirely to visiting the Aquarium.

**Day 6** Day trip to Sintra",0,7,1730401998.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ggmhh2/lisbon_early_stage_itinerary_check_travel_with/,urlocalgaijin

- Seville
- Rome

2) could Porto be fitted into it for a night or two? See that you could get a 3 hour train there and back to Lisbon. Should I just do Lisbon and visit outwith or just do 5 days (basically 2 for travel) in Lisbon. It’s easier to get an ok timed connecting flight to Lisbon than Porto.

Original idea was Porto, to Lisbon, to Madrid.

Another idea that I'm rather keen on is was to just pop about cities on the way to Madrid. 3 days in Porto, one in Amarante, maybe one in Villa Real or Pinhao, one in Salamanca-- and end up in Madrid eventually.

We have 8 days (9 nights) and we're thinking of spending them between Porto, Lisbon and the Algarve, also because while we both agreed on Lisbon, he prefers Porto while I am more interested in the Algarve. We know it could be a bit too rushed, but we thought it could be a nice compromise between the two options. We would arrive in the evening in Porto, and spend the next 2 full days there. Then we would take a bus (3 hours) to Lisbon on the morning of the 3rd day and spend the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th day there. We would include at least a day trip to Sintra, maybe also one to Cascais. On the morning of the 7th day we would tale another bus for the Algarve (4 hours), and spend the 7th and 8th day there. On the ninth day we would take a train to Faro and catch our flight in the afternoon. Do you think it's really too rushed?",7,15,1718181058.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1de1p8b/8_days_in_portugal_porto_lisbon_and_algarve/,elisamartina
Rome or Venice VS Lisbon or Porto,"I am turning 35 this April and want to splash out big on two holidays. I have dreaming of wanting to go to Rome since i was a child, but I am acutely conscious that it will be very busy and expensive. I am wondering if Lisbon and Porto might be better and cheaper. Also ROme and Venice are very touristy during these times. ",2,23,1709758438.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1b8axnd/rome_or_venice_vs_lisbon_or_porto/,KasaUnsari
"November trip between Lisbon and Faro, Portugal","I'm planning a trip with my boyfriend in the last week of November. We will spend two days in Lisbon/Sintras/Cascais and then have a full day and night to get from there to the Albufeira/Faro area to meet up with some friends. We haven't decided whether to take a bus or rent a car. If we are not there in sunny/beachy weather, I'm not sure if going along the coast will be as fun.

My questions are: Should we go along the Atlantic coast and stay the night somewhere there or go inland and stay somewhere like Evora? What is worth seeing between Lisbon and Faro in late November? Do you recommend renting a car to get between cities or taking public transportation?

Thank you so much for any suggestions!! We are completely open as long as it is somewhere generally between Lisbon and Faro.",0,3,1731527569.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gqltji/november_trip_between_lisbon_and_faro_portugal/,evrythingisstressful
2.5 days in Lisbon. Should I visit Sintra?,"This is my first time going to Europe since 2003. I'll be in Porto for two nights and I'll be taking the train early next morning to Lisbon and plan to stay 3 more nights. I was thinking of doing one of those 8 hour guided tours to Sintra while I'm there. Is it worth ""sacrificing"" one of those days in Lisbon to visit?

Fined on the lisbon bus,"I am a solo traveler visiting Portugal and I was in one of the buses in Lisbon, apparently the card reader didn't read my viva viagem card, so the inspector came to me and told me I had to pay a fine between 120 - 350 euros, i explained to him that I swiped my transport card but maybe the machine didn't read it, and told him check if i got enough credit, he insisted that I have intended not to use the card reader and ride the bus. What a strange incident, I went to the police station and they told me we can't do anything to you. 

What should i do in this case? 

Has anyone fell into this travel trap?


Update: i went to the Carris company and explained the situation, they promised me that they will do the best to waive the fine to me, and they were really helpful in that sense.",0,50,1677081582.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1193c8r/fined_on_the_lisbon_bus/,Affectionate_Cost_11

Lisbon Christmas Markets?,"Hi! My husband and I are traveling with our three year old in early December to Europe! We have done German, French etc markets before and now looking to show our three year old ""The Magic of Christmas!"" 

Initially we were planning on doing London/Vienna with our little one but I THINK we are leaning towards Portugal due to weather! I mean, 60 degrees in December sounds like a dream coming from the US. Any thoughts and opinions on Lisbon? Festive vibes? Good food? Cheer? Winter Wonderland I hear is amazing!  We are also planning on staying at Martinhal in Chiado (Kinderhotel). More insight the better :)

"Which of these cities would I be most comfortable with solo traveling if I only know English and I plan to stay at a hostel: Lisbon, Porto, or Madrid?","I'm from Canada and I'm planning a trip this summer from Toronto to Amsterdam. In between that, I want to book a free multi-day stopover before I arrive at my final destination (Amsterdam). I looked into airlines that offer free multi-day stopovers. TAP Air Portugal has one for people wanting to visit Lisbon/Porto and Iberia has one only if you want to visit Madrid.

If I'm going to be solo travelling and staying at a hostel, which of those cities will I be most comfortable with if I only know English? I should mention I plan to party and go out to nightclubs when I'm travelling so that's why I picked these three cities.",0,16,1717514338.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d7zqtt/which_of_these_cities_would_i_be_most_comfortable/,techsavvynerd91
Roadtrip planning Madrid->Lisbon,"I'm planning a trip with around 3-4 nights each in Barcelona, Madrid, and Lisbon. We prefer to avoid flying 'within' a trip and try to travel by train where possible. But now that the overnight train from Madrid to Lisbon is no longer running (rip) getting to Portugal in this way feels quite difficult.

I'm looking at options for what could be a roadtrip to take us from Madrid to Lisbon and tick off some good destinations on the way. It could be just a couple days or as long as four or five days if the stops are good enough. I'd like to do this as a way of seeing some beautiful things outside of the big cities, like maybe some more natural or rural sites or some little day hikes and tours, but struggling to choose between the north and the south of Spain, and also a bit intimidated by driving narrow streets in villages to get to our sights etc. I'm also not that interested in beaches (coming from Australia lol)

Where should we consider going to stitch together into this part of a trip?",1,5,1728822751.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g2om4h/roadtrip_planning_madridlisbon/,brishack
