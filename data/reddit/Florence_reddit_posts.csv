Our trip to Florence last week,"My wife wanted to go to Florence to see the La Specola museum especially to see their anatomical wax models (photo’s 9-11). She makes models herself for various subjects. To get there, we drove from the Netherlands to Florence with a stop of 2 nights in Switzerland for a hike (photo’s 1-3) which was spectacular. Afterwards we drove further to Florence where we spent 4 days. The architecture was mindblowing, the food was awesome and we got to see the Duomo up close (photo’s 5-8) and at sunset (photo 4) which was an awesome experience, albeit busy. The wax models at the La Specola museum were astonishing. They were presented in very beautiful rooms and vitrines and looked almost real. It was impressive to see how they could make these models in the 18-19th century. They also have a beautiful mineral collection.

"Need to cut 1 city - Barcelona, Madrid, Granada, Seville, Bologna, Florence, Cinque Terre","We are planning on spending 3 days in each of the cities but unfortunately need to cut one city from the list. This will be my wife and my first trip to Spain and Italy (or anywhere in Europe), and we like cities with a mix of culture, nature and interesting things to see and do. We aren't big on clubbing or going to bars. Here are the contenders: 

* Barcelona
* Madrid
* Granada
* Seville 
* Bologna
* Florence 
* Cinque Terre

Keen to hear people's thoughts! 

Edit: thanks everyone for the feedback! I should note that my partner and I are quite fast paced travelers and it isn’t easy to get to Europe from Australia, hence why the packed itinerary. But I do understand the sentiment and will take that into consideration.

What are some beautiful cities that are completely ignored?,"I’m not talking about Bologna as an alternative to Florence, or Porto as an alternative to Lisbon, but about beautiful cities that seem to not even serve as backups or cheaper alternatives.

Five examples from my travels:

Pittsburgh - This American metropolis of 2.5 million has beautiful scenery, great pre-war architecture (Cathedral of Learning, Gulf Tower), fun activities (Baseball @ PNC Park, Andy Warhol Museum) and is very affordable.

Puebla - This Mexican metropolis of 3 million has some of the most incredible baroque churches I’ve seen and great food. It’s so close to Mexico City and yet gets little foreign tourism.

Tainan - The Kyoto of Taiwan that seems to be completely ignored outside of Taiwanese. Very historic and beautiful pictures with historic structures next to palm trees and mangroves.

Turin - A very affordable Italian city with a classy vibe, some incredible museums (Egyptian Museum, National Museum of Cinema, National Museum of the Automobile)

Wroclaw - Very cheap, with a historic center, beautiful monumental structures (Wroclaw Town Hall, Centennial Hall) and some stunning churches.

Any others I’m missing? They don’t have to be big (I though Stirling, Scotland was stunning and had Edinburgh vibes with a much smaller population).",2302,1036,1743427026.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jo2yf9/what_are_some_beautiful_cities_that_are/,RainbowCrown71

Is There Another City That Feels Like Prague?,"I traveled to Europe a long time ago, and I really enjoyed Prague. On the other hand,  I didn't personally connect with Paris. Sorry to Parisians.

Now I’m planning to travel to Europe again this summer, and I want to feel the same charm I felt in Prague—but not *in*Prague this time, because I didn’t have a great experience with the food there. Sorry again.

I’ve been searching online and looking at photos of cities like Vienna, Milan, Florence, Barcelona, Munich, Warsaw, etc. But none of them seem to have the same atmosphere as Prague.

I think there’s something special about Prague—maybe its architecture or the layout of the old town—but I can't describe exactly what it is.

If I can figure out what makes Prague feel so unique, maybe I can find another city with a similar charm.

So… what exactly makes Prague different? And are there any cities that feel similar to Prague?",632,428,1745559000.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k7dcg6/is_there_another_city_that_feels_like_prague/,Dazzling-Honeydew457

Traveling to Florence....need advice so I can take my 5-year-old picky eater.,"Hi all, I hope this is the right place to post my question.  I need to be in Florence, Italy, for a family member's wedding.  I have never been.  So, I figure it would be an amazing opportunity to take my wife and little boy.  That brings me to the dilemma.  My son has many food/texture issues.  He eats things like chicken tenders/nuggets, only Prego spaghetti/pasta, the fried ravioli, and sometimes roasted chicken.  Once in a while- trout baked plain with salt only.  

  
He will not even eat pizza, hot dogs, beef, lamb, etc.  You can forget about spicy food, curries. etc. even making it near his mouth. So, I am trying to determine what to do with his food situation if I take him.  If he does not go, I go solo of course.  Do you travelers with kids have any thoughts?  I don't think it will be easy to find chicken nuggets or fried chicken in Florence or Europe in general (let's say we go to Vienna as well).  He will eat plain Prego marinara so possible he will eat pasta if the sauce is like marinara.  We cannot carry his food so this could be a problem.  Thought I'd ask here before simply going solo.  Thanks for any advice or information that may be helpful.  If there are any great cities near Florence in other nearby countries, please let me know.",0,50,1731171405.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gnegbd/traveling_to_florenceneed_advice_so_i_can_take_my/,F4Flyer

"Correct Order for Rome, Florence, and Naples - June 2026 Travel Dates","Planning a first-time trip to Italy the first two weeks of June 2026 (6/1-6/12). Party of 5, with 3 teens. It is more of an ""educational"" trip than a relaxation and wine trip. The trip dates and number of overnights are flexible, so we have 11-12 overnights to play around with (not counting the red-eye overnight flight at the start of the trip). That leaves us 12-13 days (not counting departure day for the red-eye flight), with the first day being a shortened/jet-lag day and the last day being a lost travel day. We are looking to stay in Rome, Florence, and one of Naples/Sorrento/Amalfi. We don't want to move between lodgings more than twice during the trip. We have flexibility on the flights/airports, so to avoid wasting too much time doubling back, we are likely flying into Florence and then heading south, or into Naples and then heading north (I know there will still be a small bit of doubling back if we stay in S or A). Three questions:

1. Which order is better: Florence-Rome-N/S/A, or N/S/A-Rome-Florence?
2. Which of N/S/A is the best fit to stay in for this ""educational"" trip?
3. Regardless of the direction, the plan would be 4 nights Florence, 4 nights Rome, and 3-4 nights N/S/A. Is that the right mix?",1,13,1747161405.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1klto2t/correct_order_for_rome_florence_and_naples_june/,Nubby_Anakin
Trip Report - Two Weeks in Northern Italy! (From Florence to Milan),"***Trip Length:*** 15 days (April 5-19)
**Final Budget:** about €3k (including hotels and flights from Belgium; Vueling & EasyJet).

**Destination(s):** Florence (4 nights) > Siena (2 nights) > Bologna (3 nights) > Parma (2 nights) > Milan (+ Lake Como; 3 nights)
***
**Activities:**

Florence:  
I got a Brunelleschi pass and visited the Giotto Bell Tower, the Duomo and Dome, the crypt, and the baptistery. I highly recommend it! Even though you have to book your time slot in advance for the climb up to Dome. I'm happy I visited in early spring because I cannot imagine climbing up all those stairs in summer weather.  
  
Palazzo Vecchio (recommended for the decorated ceilings); Academia (statue of David); Ponte Vecchio; Piazza Michelangelo for the sunset (it's very crowded); Uffizi gallery (must for art lovers, time slot required). Medici Chapels and Church of San Lorenzo (insanely impressive); Santa Croce (for the tombs of Michelangelo, Dante, Machiavelli, Galileo). I did an excellent walking tour about Medici and Florentine history as well which hit up most of these sights from the outside. Bonus tip: hit up some wine windows!    
--> Regional bus to Siena

* * *
Siena:
  
What an incredibly charming city! I got lucky and booked a hotel that was about a 30 second walk from the main square (Piazza Maggiore and Tower. I highly recommend visiting the Duomo (+ museum and baptistery as a combo ticket). I got the pass that allows you to climb up, great views of Siena). I also climbed up the tower in the main square (short wait, not a lot of people) and visited the Palazzo Publico afterwards (quaint museum, but the main room with the frescoes was closed off. I'd only do it if you have time to spare).  
--> Flixbus to Bologna
  
* * *
Bologna:  
  
Great food, but a bit of a smaller city center than I had expected. I could've cut a day here to spend it somewhere else. I saw the two towers, went inside the Duomo, climbed all the way up through the world's longest portico to Sanctuary of San Luca (absolutely not recommend, it took me about an hour from the city center and the climb up is consistently gruelling, there's not much to see at the top either but it does help you burn the calories from all the delicious food.); Torre dell'Orologio (time slot needed, great view!). Pinacoteca (nice if you have time to spare); Anatomical Theatre; Seven Churches (with walking tour).  
--> train to Parma

* * *
Parma:  
  
I went to Parma mainly for the food, and I was not left disappointed! More of a small town vibe, but a lovely museum with the Farnese Theatre (all wooden structure) and museum. The church was very richly decorated, but the baptistery was a bit overpriced and, in my opinion, not quite worth it. Lovely town, but I wouldn't spend a ton of time here, unless you want to visit the cheese and Parma ham factories.  
--> train to Milan

* * *
Milan:  
Duomo (only visited the inside, it was too windy and cold to go up; time slot needed again). Da Vinci's Last Supper (walking tour, very expensive but I didn't get the tickets in advance, absolutely worth it though!). Castello Sforzesco; Pinacoteca (excellent museum with some big names). Basilica of San Domenico (tomb of Saint Dominic); bone church (San Bernardino alle Ossa)

Day trip to Lake Como (by train):  
  
A place that I would definitely visit again! I took the train up to Varenna and the ferry to Bellagio. Absolutely stunning little towns at the center of the lake. I cannot recommend the Villa Monasterio's botanical gardens enough! Such a beautiful place and an excellent backdrop for photos. Again, I cannot imagine the number of people that would visit in summer. The line for the ferry was absolutely huge (I made the mistake of thinking it was the line for the tickets, turns out you have to get the tickets separately and then stand in line).  

* * *
**What Went Right:**

I was a bit apprehensive about public transportation in Italy (I've had buses not show up before, or way too late... or too early), but it seemed to work perfectly fine. The train and bus tickets are insanely cheap.  
  
The food was absolutely delicious, as expected. Recommendations: Schiacciata in Firenze; Pici and Chianti in Siena; anything with parmigiano reggiano in Parma; lasagna/tortellini/mortadella in Bologna; ossobuco/risotto and cotoletta in Milan.

**What Went Wrong:**

I managed to catch a travel bug (or maybe food poisoning) and had to throw up a couple of times very early on in my trip. Luckily, I always pack probiotics. I also tore my jeans, probably while climbing up the giotto in Florence (it's steeper than it looks).  

**Recommendations:**
  
Book your time slots in advance if you want to see the main attractions. The tickets sell out way in advance and walk-ins are not always guaranteed. It requires a bit more planning than usual, but it's worth it.

**Final Verdict:**  

If you're on the hunt for great Italian food that's something else than pizza, you can't go wrong with Northern Italy. It's also a go-to if you have any interest in renaissance art and architecture. I definitely could've cut a (half) day here and there, but the pace was very relaxed and allowed me to explore more than just the highlights.",15,9,1748194395.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kv85mt/trip_report_two_weeks_in_northern_italy_from/,NGDragon

27 September Saturday - Florence
28 September Sunday - Florence
29 September Monday - Going back to Rome again (Vatican)
30 September - Rome again 
1 October - Return to home.

Do you have any other advice? Do you think this itinerary is cool? I will be returning back to Rome because there is no flight from Florence to my home country. I can go back from Rome. Other flights are from Milan, Venice and Bologna.

"Venice or Florence, Italy?","Hi!

My husband and I traveling to Italy this September and will have 2 days to spend in either Venice or Florence. We are already spending the rest of our trip in Rome and the Amalfi Coast and would like to fit a 3rd city in. We are debating between Venice and Florence. Here are our pros and cons. Would love your advice and recommendation on which city to pick. Thank you!

More about our interests: We don't care to visit museums, which I know Florence has a lot of, so that doesn't appeal to us at all. We love food, architecture, sightseeing, and beautiful scenery.

**Venice**

Note: If we go to Venice, it will be from Sept. 19-21, after the Venice Film Festival so hopefully it's less crowded during this time.

Pros:

* Beautiful, romantic city where the city itself is the art
* Smaller city so we can see more in 2 days and won't feel like we're being rushed or jam-packing our schedule
* Can take it slow exploring the city on our last few days in Italy before we fly home

Cons:

* More touristy and smaller city than Florence, so potentially more crowded
* More expensive than Florence
* Would have to change our flight to fly out of Venice (currently flying out of Rome), which is \~$150 extra per person
* Further out than Florence and would be a longer transport to get to Venice from Rome

  
**Florence**

Pros:

* More convenient city to fit into our current schedule as we will be in the Amalfi Coast and Rome. If we go to Florence, we would start in the Amalfi Coast, go to Florence, then end and fly out of Rome.
* We won't have to change our flight back home and we can still fly out of Rome
* We heard the food is better in Florence

Cons:

* Venice to me seems so much prettier than Florence
* Florence is bigger and seems to have more things to do, which we won't be able to do all in 2 days. I'm sure we can fit in a few highlights but will it be worth going there for 2 days?

Hello everyone,

We are visiting Florence and Tuscany with my girlfriend the week of Easter and I would love if you could take a look at the schedule above. I would appreciate general advice, as well as particular suggestions on places to eat close to the locations noted (I have specified when we would like to have a sit-down meal in the schedule). Any particular suggestions you might have are also very welcome.

Really appreciate your insight, thank you!",1,13,1744103764.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ju99vc/6day_florence_and_tuscany_itinerary_feedback/,kaptainkouk

"11- day Itinerary: Venice, Bologna, Florence, and Rome","My partner and I leave for Italy on May 30 and planned out the below itinerary. We have tickets for the big tourist activities so those are pretty set in stone, but would love any other input on how to spend our free time or general advice/feedback. I also know this is fast paced for some, but I don’t know if/when we’ll return so we want to accomplish a lot. On the other hand, any validation that this schedule isn’t ridiculous is definitely appreciated! 

Day 1: overnight flight to Venice, arrive the morning of May 31. No plans this day except checking into the hotel, wandering around to Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco, and taking everything in. Sleep in Venice.

Day 2: Doge’s Palace mid-morning. I also have tickets to the Correr museum but if we’re feeling taking a ferry to Murano in the afternoon instead we’ll do that. Sleep in Venice. 

Day 3: St. Mark’s Basilica first thing in the morning. Noon-ish train to Bologna. Check into hotel in Bologna. Walk around/eat in city center. Sleep in Bologna. 

Day 4: 5-hour tour to Parmesan factory, balsamic vinegar distillery, and winery outside of Bologna. Dinner/strolling around in Bologna. Sleep in Bologna.

Day 5: Breakfast in Bologna. Noon-ish train to Florence. Do Rick Steves walk/stroll to see duomo and Palazzo Vecchio. Sleep in Florence. 

Day 6: Morning climb Giotto’s tower. Stroll/shop and lunch. Uffizi at 3 pm. Michelangelo Piazza for sunset. Sleep in Florence. 

Day 7: Accademia in the morning then either stroll around Florence or day trip to Siena or San Gimignano. Sleep in Florence. 

Day 8: Breakfast then mid-morning train to Rome. Vatican Museums/Sistine Chapel at 1:30. Dinner, stroll, sleep in Rome. 

Day 9: No plans! Maybe Garden of oranges or strolling Monti or Travestere? Vatican will probably be packed this day with Jubilee events so staying away. Sleep in Rome. 

Day 10: Early morning Trevi Fountain. Coliseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill. Sleep in Rome.

Day 11: St. Peter’s Basilica then climb the dome. Villa Borghese. Evening Borghese Gallery. Walk to Spanish Steps for sunset. Sleep in Rome.

Day 12: Early morning train to the airport and we’re out! ",2,6,1747753692.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kr78fw/11_day_itinerary_venice_bologna_florence_and_rome/,cleo-moses
Travelling from Cinque Terre to Florence on 20/6/25,Hello - looking for some advice. My understanding is that there are strikes affecting multiple modes of travel on this date. Is there any suggestions anyone would have in terms of trying to navigate how to best reach Florence? Ideally trying to reach Florence on 20/6 to avoid rescheduling other things. Travel on 20/6 itself is flexible. The Flixibus bus stop appears to be miles away from the La Spezia station. Appreciate if anyone had any suggestions or input.

Florence and more of Tuscany region? Will we get lost? Is this a good plan? For me and mum,"So me and my mum are flying to PISA next week and then travelling to Florence to pick up a CAR to go to Chianti

Then Siena to visit? Not sure as we will be doing Florence City Centre

Then a spa hotel in Bagno Vignoni with hot springs

And then back to Florence City Centre to explore for 2 days

What do you think of this plan? Are these the places you would recommend? I don't know whether we should be staying somewhere when rural like for 2 days around Chianti region like big castle pool etc. instead of doing the both Chianti and Bagno Vignoni.

My mum can't walk very far hence us driving and then she needs to eat at the hotel in the evening due to illness. She is interested in the food, wine, views, history and wellness.

Rome for the first time with my parents - blatant racism was disappointing,"My boyfriend and I invited my parents to visit Rome with us. They live in the USA and have never traveled to Europe before (I grew up poor because my parents were in phd and post-doc programs that took awhile and we never had the means to travel). They were both so excited because traveling to Europe was their dream. I now make enough money to spoil them (and I have to do it soon as they are getting older) and we all couldn’t sleep from excitement the weeks leading up to this trip.

When my mom saw the Trevi Fountain, she burst into tears because she never thought she’d make it to Rome in her life time. This was despite the crazy heat and throngs of tourists pushing against her. She was so happy to just be here. My dad also could not stop taking photos and looking around in awe. He is normally very stoic but he was so amazed by the sceneries that it cracked his normal quiet demeanor.

However, on our last couple of days we experienced some awful racism that ruined our trip. 

The first incident happened in Trastevere. We were going up a street that lead to an outlook. On that street, there was a man leaning against the railing facing in the sidewalk. There were many people in front of us also going up that sidewalk. However, when he saw my mom about to walk past him, he pulled out his mask and put it on while giving her major side eye and a general look of disgust. This confused my mom because there was a huge group that passed him minutes ago, but they were all white. My mom is Asian. He didn’t put on his mask for the non-Asian tourists passing him.

I saw this all happen and asked him why he did that in English as my mom was extremely upset. His wife, sitting across from him leapt up and started screaming at us to “go away” and calling us crazy bitches over and over again. My mom and I didn’t raise our voices at all so this behavior seemed really defensive and rude overall. She kept yelling at us and getting up in our faces that we walked away eventually. However, it truly made us feel crappy and unwelcome in this country / city. The subtle way this man looked at my mom and put on his mask, the gaslighting for calling US crazy were quiet forms of micro aggression and racism that hurt like hell. 

The second incident happened at a grocery store near the colosseum. My dad and I went to grab some vegetables. We didn’t realize that we were supposed to weigh our vegetables ourselves to get the price. During checkout, the cashier looked at the cucumber we bought and told us to “get a number.” We didn’t realize she meant weight so we gave her a produce number. She rolled her eyes and threw the cucumber aside and said under her breath “stupid Chinese.” She never put the cucumber back. She then asked us to pay and my dad inserted his card. She told him to sign. He was reaching to sign, but then she slapped his hand away and forged his signature herself while rolling her eyes and calling us stupid Chinese again. I asked what was with her attitude and she looked at me and said “I don’t understand your English.” Which is absurd because I was born in Wisconsin lol.

Other incidents like these happened too, but they were less blatant and egregious. We were so excited to be here but now we are just sad and feel unwelcome.

We are going to Florence next week but it’s hard to feel excited. Instead I have major anxiety about getting treated poorly because we are Asian. Is this normal behavior in Italy?",2194,811,1662834201.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xawa16/rome_for_the_first_time_with_my_parents_blatant/,mochi_donuts414
Went to Florence and Rome last year. What next for ancient civilizations lovers?,"So me and my wife went to Florence and Rome last year for our honeymoon. I loved it, especially Rome. Florence was great, but Rome is amazing. I am pretty into ancient cultures like rome, ancient greece, egypt and so on, and the sheer quantity of roman stuff in, well, Rome, was astounding. Not to mention things like the Vatican... 

I'm wondering if there are any destinations in Europe that would come close to rome? I'd love to see greece, but i assume that would involve way more moving around the country to see all the historic landmarks. I have a suspicion that nothing will really come close to Rome, but I also assume a lot of people are much better informed about this than me.",38,96,1679396806.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11xdnck/went_to_florence_and_rome_last_year_what_next_for/,w0mbatina
I thought Barcelona was overrated. Until I went.,"I was in France visiting family when I found out I has a bonus week off for time in lieu so I decided to take a long weekend somewhere. My criteria was not too far from where I was, accessible by public transport, and easy to get home from. Barcelona fit the bill, tickets were fairly cheap so I went. 

I'd heard people raving about how beautiful the architecture and the history is but to be honest, I don't care much about architecture and history. Most of my trips are to remote, isolated places with beautiful natural scenery. I just wanted a place to lay on the beach and relax. I've been to Paris and absolutely hated it. It was cramped, smelly and full of tourists (yes, I recognise the irony) 

It's a amazing city. Most places are easy walking distance from the city centre. The beach is really clean and well maintained. The government has staff to pick up litter from the beach and the sea, and the facilities are surprisingly decent (for public toilets). 

I went to check out some of the tourist sites when it was too hot to lay on the beach and I was impressed at how many of them are in such close proximity, and are free to view or a small donation. 

Overall, things were pretty easy and there was a laid back atmosphere. It's clearly a tourist destination but it didn't feel like a rip off tourist trap like some places 

If you were on the fence about Barcelona, give it a shot. I'd stay longer if I could",2012,441,1690208089.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/158bwqm/i_thought_barcelona_was_overrated_until_i_went/,tomgrouch

Travel pics of 2024,"A summary of my trips throughout the year. Images are in order.

Started 2024 with a trip to Budapest (1/13) - where I spent 3,5 days. In February, a weekend in Strasbourg and Colmar (2/13); in March, a week in Warsaw (3/13) and Krakow - about 3 days in each city.

In May, went to Salzburg (4/13) for a day trip. I currently live in Munich so it's a short train ride from there, about 2hrs. In June, I spent two weeks in Italy: flew from Munich to Naples (stayed 3 days), then Rome (4 days), Florence (5/13; 3 days), and Venice (2 days).

Throughout the Summer, went to the Greek island of Zakynthos (6/13) for about 4 days and also visited some places across Germany (7/13; Schloss Neuschwanstein in the image). In September, spent a weekend in Liechtenstein (8/13) and, from there, went to St. Gallen, Switzerland (9/13).

In October flew from Munich to Barcelona (10/13) and, while there, took a train to Girona (4 days in total). After that, flew to the Azores - São Miguel (11/13) and Terceira Islands (5 days in total). 

To wrap up the year, flew from Munich to Luxembourg (12/13) earlier this month, spent over 1,5 days there, and then took a train to Belgium, where I visited Ghent (13/13), Bruges, Antwerp and Brussels for about a week.",3457,64,1735598236.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpzl9p,rubesf9
"Question about Traffic Ticket while visiting Florence, Italy","Hi all - I'm located in the United States. I received a traffic ticket via UPS yesterday from a violation when we visited last summer (9 months ago). There are 3 tiers of payment... 1 is within 5 days of ""notification date"", 2nd is 6-60 days from notification, and 3rd is over 60 days. They are VERY different amounts. Problem is there is nothing on the ticket that says what the actual ""notification"" date is. Does anyone know if that would be the day I received the ticket, and would I have to prove that via post-mark? There's a random date at the bottom of the form from about a month ago, which is the most recent date on the form... maybe that is when the printed and mailed the form, so that is considered the notification date? The website to pay the ticket is not very helpful either.

I travel to Italy for work sometimes and don't want to have issues with renting a car because of this, but also don't want to pay the exorbitant amount the 60+ days is...

Some advice from an Italian living in Italy to those who want to travel to Italy to avoid scams,"If you go to Rome or the main Italian cities, pay close attention to these things:

- Never accept bracelets or necklaces from those who tell you that they are gifts, they are never gifts and will probably ask you for money back. Sometimes they throw you the bracelet so that you instinctively take it and then, as above, they try to convince you to take something out to send them away. The only advice in these cases is to completely ignore these people and not stop to talk to them at all, even at the risk of being considered rude.

- In Florence, some guys put fake paintings on the ground in the middle of the crowd, where one can easily step on them and then ask for money for compensation, they are not usually aggressive, but only slightly insistent.
Even in that case, it is better to completely ignore the people and go away pretending not to hear them.

- In Naples, as stated in the initial point, there are people dressed as Pulcinella or Neapolitan horn sellers, the former offer you a photo with them and then expect to be paid, a bit like those who are dressed as Gladiators at the Colosseum. For the latter, sellers of bracelets, horns, handkerchiefs or various knick-knacks, the approach is sometimes simply like ""Hey guys, can I ask you a favor?"" Never answer, ignore them and carry on, their goal is only to make you buy something and extort money.

- Finally, always be careful around tourist sites of those who offer to give you directions to take a photo or give you suggestions on how to do it, it is never free and always paid.

For taxis: always make sure the taximeter is on, never negotiate the price first and find out about the official rates on the websites of the municipal administrations of the cities where you are, so you can point out to taxi drivers, in the event that they propose a certain price, that theirs is too high. If you intend to pay by card, always point this out to the taxi driver first, since some use the excuse of having a broken POS to evade taxes.
Furthermore, official taxis throughout Italy are white, the others are abusive and illegal.

To eat, avoid restaurants or bars in the most central tourist streets, they are usually only crowded with tourists, especially those with waiters outside inviting you to come in, you eat badly and spend a lot.
Try to go to eat outside the tourist areas, where Italians usually go.
If you really have to go to a tourist area, even for a coffee, always ask for the menu first, at least you know how much you will spend.

To visit operas, parks, museums and monuments, always book on the official websites of the opera or museum and never buy fake tickets or tours there from those who want to extort money from you to offer you a tour at the last minute by skipping the line, they are ripping you off on the price by probably making you pay double. 

For now this is all that comes to mind, for any other questions or doubts I remain at your disposal  ",1192,114,1742666261.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jheekn/some_advice_from_an_italian_living_in_italy_to/,_Giulio_Cesare

Thanked God for being able to see that incredible view and overcoming a lot of painful things. Italy has been a dream since I was a kid (Florence especially). I felt like I needed a few more days to really grasp that I actually made it to Italy but I hope to be back there soon.

"Advice on splitting 10 nights between Rome, Florence, Munich, Berlin, and Copenhagen?","**Edit: Looks like I spread myself too thin. I think since I won't have a chance to go to Europe again for a while, I was trying to cram too much in. I'll arrive in Rome, leave from Copenhagen, and likely do one more city in between. Any recommendations are welcome!**

**Edit 2: Thanks to everyone who provided some great thorough and friendly advice! I think we’re going to do 4 nights in Rome, 3 in Berlin, and 3 in Copenhagen. 

I will be traveling to Europe from the U.S. for 10 nights this Summer.  We don't get the opportunity to travel internationally very often (only twice in our lives) so we're very excited. The first destination is Rome, and the last is Copenhagen. That is all that's set in stone at the moment (we have flights booked). My partner and I have picked Florence, Munich, and Berlin as great spots to visit in between.

The current lineup is:

Rome - 2 nights

Train to Florance

Florence - 2 nights

Debating overnight train vs. Flight to Munich

Munich - 1 night (There for the BMW factory)

Train to Berlin

Berlin - 2 nights

Flight to Copenhagen

Copenhagen - 3 nights

Florence on a Free Sunday,"Hello! I'll be going to Florence on June 1, a free sunday. I will only have 3.5 hours there (12:00-15:30), so I do not want to waste time standing in lines!! I've not been to Florence at all before, so I would love to see the most iconic sights and museums.

I would love your recommendation of an itinerary! What are the things you absolutely cannot miss given this small time frame? What is overrated and can be skipped? (Knowing places like the Uffizi and the Accademia will be impossible due to free sunday, and that the Duomo cathedral will  be closed due to it being a Sunday)  


My current considerations: Medici Chapel, Duomo Climb, Duomo Museum (worth it?), Piazza della Signoria, Bargello, walk by but not go in Palazzo Vecchio, Ponte Vecchio. What should I cut to make it in 3.5 hours?

Transit Help - San Sebastián to Nice to Florence,"For my next trip, I have three specific cities I want to visit: San Sebastián to Nice to Florence. I’m traveling from the U.S.

Since these cities are smallish and in different countries, it looks like they don’t connect that well. My preferred method is always by train, but I’ll resort to flying if necessary.

How would you go about getting from/to these cities? Even for flying, it looks like a lot of routes require connecting to major hubs like Madrid/Paris instead of flying directly.

I don’t mind slight detours to, say, Bilbao or Marseille, of course. Just want to avoid a silly 6 hr flight itinerary for cities that aren’t THAT far apart.

Rome + Florence in 8-9 days. Am I doing too much or too little?,"Part 2 of [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1abe7rj/rome_florence_in_early_march_is_8_days_too/) where I'm revisiting my itinerary based on feedback I got from it.

The goal is visiting Rome and Florence, the main attractions in each city (I assume I'll be back) in about 9 or 10 days. I'm focusing on history and art, enjoy the cuisine and have a budget of €1000 + travel. I'm in my mid-30s and I'm relatively fit. I plan to stay in Trastévere.

I'd like to know what you think about this revision of the places and activities I plan to do, especially the time they'll take. I'll try to buy skip-the-line tickets whenever possible but I know some places don't have such arrangements so I'll have to calculate ""time getting there"" + ""time waiting in line"" which may break my schedule.

Here's my new itinerary:

**Day 1**: First day in Rome. I'll arrive the day before late at night so I can start in the morning. Starting at 8:30hs

* Colosseum: 3hs
* Roman Forum: 2.5hs
* Palatine Hill: 1h
* Titus Triumph: 0.5hs
* *Total: 7hs of activities*

**Day 2**: Vatican City

* St. Peter's Square: 1h
* St. Peter's Basilica: 2hs
* Sistine Chapel: 1h
* Vatican Museums: 2hs
* Vatican Gardens: 1h
* Castelo Sant'Angelo: 2hs
* *Total: 9hs of activities.* This I think I'm stretching, but I think I can cut the Vatican Museums to 1h and strolling around St. Peter's Square may not take 1h.

**Day 3**: Other historical places

* Campidoglio: 0.5h
* San Pietro In Vincoli church: 1h
* Gesú Church: 1h
* Trajan Forum: 1h
* Fatherland Monument: 1.5hs
* Fontana di Trevi: 1h
* Spanish Steps: 1h
* *Total time: 7hs of activities*. I'll go to Fontana di Trevi and see if there's too many people, otherwise first hit the Spanish Steps and then go back to the fountain later at night.

**Day 4**: some sights and walking through Trastévere

* Curia of Pompey: 0.5h
* Pantheon: 1h
* Piazza Navona: 1h
* Walk from Piazza Navona, across the Tiber, stroll down Trastévere to Porta Portese all the way to Circus Maximus: 4hs
* Circus Maximus: 1h
* *Total: 7.5hs of activities*

**Day 5**: First day in Florence. I'll arrive the night before so I'll begin in the morning. This day I spend in the Duomo and around

* Duomo: 5hs
* Giotto Bell Tower: 1h
* Medici Chapel: 2h
* Mercato Centrale: 1h
* *Total time: 9hs of activities.* I may be stretching but I'm adding extra time to the Duomo. The Bell Tower may be mostly queueing and climbing the stairs

**Day 6**: Florence museums

* Gallery of the Academia dell'Arte: 1.5hs
* Uffizi: 6hs
* Ponte Vecchio: 0.5hs
* Santa Croce Basilica: 1h
* *Total: 9hs of activities.* Again, I'm giving the Uffizi lots of time, it may take less if I plan to see less and come back some other time.

**Day 7**: Palaces and gardens

* Piazza della Signoria: 1.5hs
* Palazzo Vecchio: 1.5hs
* Palazzo Pitti: 3.5hs
* Boboli Gardens: 2hs
* Piazzale Michelangelo: 1.5hs
* Church of Salvatore Al Monte: 1h
* *Total: 11hs of activities*. This I may have to cut in two

I have 1 or 2 more days (half of which is traveling back home, which may be from Florence airport to Fiumicino or traveling by train to Rome and then from Fiumicino back home). I could cut Day 7 in two, add Santa Croce and maybe Giotto and then I'd stay 4 days in Rome and 4 days in Florence, both running back and forth across the cities. I could also stay one more day and do a place around Florence or Rome, like Ostia Antica, Bologna or Siena.

Do you think this is still too much? Will I be too exhausted? What should I cut from my itinerary? What am I not taking into account?

Is two weeks in Florence too long?,"Hi! Me and my partner are looking at going to Florence for 10 days/2 weeks in May in a year or two. I was just wondering if this is going to be too long there though? 

I’m big into history and art, so I want to visit all of the sights, as well as do a couple of activities (e.g. a food tour, horseback ride to San Gimignano). 

I want it to be more of a relaxed holiday though, so I was thinking maybe like one thing a day, maybe two depending how long each takes. I also don’t particularly want the hassle of travelling to another place. I’ve already been to Rome, and I’ll definitely be visiting Venice at some other point in time. 

Is this plan a good idea? Or would I get bored after a while?

do I try to fit all 3 in (trains run every day) or just do Bologna and Venice. I believe Bologna and Florence both go all out for Xmas markets, events and decorations.

Final hours of my 16 months around the world trip,"**TLDR:** Made redundant at the end of 2022, didn't want to find another job. Packed up and travelled the world.

**update** done for now, flight soon, thanks for the questions. 

**update 2** ok really done now, boarding.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down. That coupled with the fact that we were cooped up after some of the most longest and strictest lockdowns it was time to get out and see the world.

The objective of the travels was essentially to explore and ""live"", as you will see most of the places we stayed were capital Cities. We ended up doing ALOT of day trips from the major capitals either by train or tour company. Most of the time it was much cheaper just to do a full day tour than to actually hire a car for the day.

Most of the places we stayed were booked through either [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Airbnb (booking.com was a much cheaper option most of the time)

The major itinerary is as follows (list may or may not include minor day trips)

**Asia / USA**

* 7 days Singapore (got covid here)
* 7 days Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
* 21 days Honolulu, Hawaii (Spur of the moment booking, I was waiting for cherry blossom season in Japan)

"Heading to Lake Como, Florence, Milan, and Rome for my first int’l trip this year","Hi!! I’m from the US and making my first trip abroad this fall and I can’t put into words how excited I am! Over the last couple days I’ve really locked in on trying to get a loose plan together and at least figure out what hotels we’re gonna stay at, and since I’m a little compulsive with planning i’d also like to go ahead and get an idea of must see things, great food, good wine, etc. For my wife’s sake, i would also kill for a recommendation on a good cannoli. The whole trip might be ruined if we can’t find one haha! 

Any recommendation is welcome no matter how popular or how unknown it is! Also if anyone has feedback on any of the hotels that would also be much appreciated! Proximity to hotel isn’t really a huge deal when it comes to any recommendations you might have because I’m there to TRAVEL so i’m gonna travel. 

In Bellagio I’ve found a couple decent looking spots (Cava Turacciolo, Enoteca Angolo Divino). We’re also going to head over to Lenno and see Villa del Balbianello. For Milan, Florence, and Rome I have no clue where to even start outside of the big tourist attractions. 

Hotels:

Lake Como - Borgo Le Terrazze in Bellagio
Milan - Corner Duomo
Florence - Orto de’ Medici
Rome - Hotel Modigliani (not 100% locked in but will likely go with that

Driving from Rome to Florence,"I am getting married in Italy in May 2025. We picked a villa about an hour outside of Florence. 
We are planning on flying to Rome since we can take a direct flight and not risk connections and delays with multiple flights. 
Since we are planning to fly into Rome our options for getting to villa are 
(1) rent a car and drive from Rome to villa (est. 3 hrs) 
(2) take train from Rome to Florence and then a taxi an hour to the villa 
(3) hire a private driver to pick us up at the Rome airport and drive us straight to the villa. 

We are leaning more towards renting a car since it would be convenient to have being in the countryside and being an hour from Florence. We are worried about driving the 3 hours if Italian drivers are crazy ? 
I know the trains are amazing but I am going to have my wedding dress and luggage and would rather have a car to take me directly to the villa. On the way back we will take the train etc. but I would like to be stress free on the way there.

"What are some well-intentioned, but bad, pieces of travel advice you often see given?","I think that this community is a useful tool for travel advice (if not the best or most well-refined) but one thing that bugs me a lot is that both here and other places, you often see people propagating travel tips as if they’re the end-all-be-all for every scenario. These people mean well, and aren’t telling you something like “Travel with a sign saying ‘Rob me,’”but the advice can still come up short. Oftentimes, I see people saying that when you’re visiting a city, you should spend at least a few days there in order to get the vibe. This is great until you realize that time and budgets are limited for a lot of people, and that their big trip might be once every five years, or ten years, or even their entire life! Despite this, you see people treating the idea that you're not *really* experiencing a place if you don’t spend at least three days there as gospel, especially on Reddit. The fact of the matter is, if you only have one shot to go to Europe, it’s probably a better bet to do two days in Florence and two in Rome rather than four in Rome- who knows if you’re ever going to see Florence again? 

Likewise, working the opposite direction, money-wise, are people who recommend upcoming or less-expensive destinations as a *replacement* for more popular/expensive places. This isn’t to say that recommending these places is a bad idea whatsoever, and indeed, some of them are favorites and better than the big ticket destinations, but the experience of having a coastal holiday in Montenegro is fundamentally not the same as the French Riviera. London might be profoundly expensive, but it’s also the only one there is, and saying “Just to to Georgia/Thailand/Spain” or whatever place people love to promote doesn’t change the fact if you want to see Big Ben or the British Museum, there’s only once place you can see them.

Any recommendations for a place to take my sister in Florence?,"My sister is turning 18 while we’re on a trip and we’ll be in Florence Italy on her birthday.

I’m hoping to take her somewhere for lunch and then do some kind of experience-based thing with her, like a museum or something.

A week in Florence in November and want to branch out: Bologna or Siena?,"I'm visiting Florence in early November for a week and wanted to spend one or two days in some other place, somewhere from where I can take a trip to a nature destination, maybe do a hiking trail that takes less than a day and then go back to this other city/town.

I was originally going to go to Cinque Terre but I found out that it's mostly closed this time of the year. But the idea is the same: somewhere that has nice scenes, more nature-oriented, quieter than a busy touristy city.

I considered two places: Bolonia (which is a university city and quite large too) and use it as base to visit Parco dei Gessi Bolognesi or Siena (smaller town) and use it as base to visit Crete Senesi.

My question is which of these two destinations fit my criteria better? Is it a good time to visit either place? Are these nature sights worth it, and worth spending a day doing activities there?

Rome + Florence in early March. Is 8 days too little/too much?,"I'm travelling to Italy for the first time and I picked Rome + Florence for that. I want to take ~10 days including traveling for it. My goals are to see the ""obvious""/""most important"" sights in both cities and enjoy the cuisine. I like art but I like Roman history more. I have a budget of < €1000 (excluding flights). I can stretch myself to < €1500. If it helps, I'm relatively-fit mid-thirties guy

This is the timeline I planned so far. I have the notion that I'm stretching Rome too much and rushing through Florence but I haven't been in either city nor seen these sights so I don't know if it's doable:

**Day 1**: arrive at Rome, go to the Colisseum

* Colisseum, full tour
* Forum Romanum
* Palatine Hill
* Titus Triumph

**Day 2**: Vatican City

* St. Peter's Square
* St. Peter's Basilica
* Sixtine Chapel
* Vatican Museums
* Vatican Gardens
* Castelo Sant'Angelo

**Day 3**: monuments (this I think I can pad with more activities)

* Campidoglio
* San Pietro In Vincoli
* Chiesa del Gesù
* Trajan's Forum
* Monument to the Fatherland

**Day 4**: half-day tour to Ostia Antica

* Ostia Antica (half-day)
* Spanish Stairs
* Villa Borghese Gardens
* Borghese Museum

**Day 5**: wrap up sights in one circular walk through Trastévere

* Start at the Curia of Pompey
* Pantheon
* Cross the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II
* Walk down the Passagiatta di Gianicolo
* Walk through Trastévere and then to Ponte Sublicio
* Walk to Circo Massimo

*Travel to Florence at night*

**Day 6**: Churches and castles

* Duomo di Firenze
* Giotto Belltower
* Medici's Chapel
* Mercato Centrale
* Piazza di Signoria
* Palazzo Vecchio
* Ponte Vecchio
* Palazzo Pitti

**Day 7**: Museums and gardens

* Uffizi
* Galileo Museum
* Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze
* Boboli Gardens
* Piazza Michelangelo
* Chiesa di San Salvatore al Monte

**Day 8**: return

Any advise? I'm also looking for recommendations for lunch and dinner and coffee. I have the following places in Florence scouted but not much in Rome:

* Gelateria Della Passera
* Gelateria Edoardo
* All'Antico Vinaio
* Cantineta dei Verrazzano
* Rivoire Berra
* Gelateria La Strega Nocciola
* I Fratellini

"Portugal, Florence and Sicily, or Greek Islands for a 10 day honeymoon in September","First, thank you to anyone and everyone in advance who can help me narrow things down. I have pretty extensive travel experience in central Europe, so I will seek to do my part in helping answer questions about places I know, now that I have found this group. 

I’m trying to decide on a honeymoon location in September. We have 10 days total and would like a mix of relaxation (beautiful views, good food, maybe massages) and a bit of exploring. By exploring, we are not the hardcore hiking or adventurous type, but we are fit, so light hiking, walking, city exploration, etc. is not a problem. I have spent some time in the northern part of Sicily and enjoyed it, but have not been to Portugal or the Greek Islands. We will be traveling from the US. I am not opposed to the idea of renting a car, scooter, or motorcycle to explore. Ten days is a lot, so my guess is that we will not stay in the same spot, but see a few different places. 

We have a budget of around 7,000 Euros for the trip, not including airfare. I am open to your suggestions since I am truly at a loss on where to go after having looked online quite a bit. If there is any important information I have missed, please let me know and I will add it to assist in recommending something appropriate.

Of course Rome would win this debate in terms of things to do and tourist attractions. But if Naples/Florence have a more vibrant fun feel with better nightlife, better/more affordable food and with gorgeous architecture, I would rather favour either of these two choices.

Traveling from Rome to Florence: Need options due to FS group train strike,"Hello, My wife and I are currently in Rome for the next couple of days and have tickets to go to Florence by train on September 8th @ 6 AM. Today, I got an email that due to a strike by the FS group most of the trains are cancelled and unless you're rescheduling your travel you can apply for a refund. We don't want to reschedule to another day as we made reservations for the Uffizi gallery tour on September 8th @ 10.30 AM.I asked our host and he informed us that there are some trains that are guaranteed to run despite the strike. I looked them up on [Trenitalia website](https://www.trenitalia.com/it/informazioni/treni_garantiti_incasodisciopero.html) but most of these  are after 5PM and none in the AM afaik.There are a couple of [Italo trains](https://www.italotreno.com/~/media/Images/content/pdf/sciopero/2024/Lista-garantiti_080924) that are also guaranteed but the one we would like to take ( Rome to Venice @ 6.55 AM , train # 8924,  has a Florence stop is what we were told ) doesn't have guaranteed as a note on the right hand column so we're not entirely sure. Is this train guaranteed to run? Can we book tickets for this train?Our plan is to visit the Trenitalia office at Roma Termini tomorrow to find out more about this Italo train # 8924 and get tickets if it is indeed guaranteed.

Taxis from Rome to Florence are really expensive but this would be our last resort if there are no guaranteed trains.Are there any other options for us to reach Florence on the morning of September 8th and still keep the tour reservation at 10.30 AM?",1,8,1725569656.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f9x7lt/traveling_from_rome_to_florence_need_options_due/,Goldfinger02

Is something happening with Airbnbs in Italy?,"So my mother has been planning her dream trip for months now. She can’t talk about something else since…Halloween. The trip is in a few weeks now.

Tonight she calls me because all of the Airbnb she booked a while ago cancelled on her on the same day. 
First two bookings just got cancelled by the hosts in Turin and Milan. Now the Firenze one has been emailing her asking my mom to cancel. Host is saying he doesn’t want to lose is superhost status if he cancels himself (lol).

Told my mom to never cancel and to call Airbnb directly first thing in the morning.

I googled and there’s nothing in the news regarding new laws in Europe or Italy that could trigger such a sudden uptick in cancellations.

Is it just bad luck or something is happening?

My mother has a strong profile on Airbnb with a lot of good reviews. It’s not her first rodeo on the platform and she is overwhelmingly nice to people. I doubt hosts saw red flags in her, causing them wanting to cancel.

So,  anyone else ?

Edit: didn't expect this post to get this much traction! I won't disclose exactly when my mother is going on vacation because duh, but it's close or during the fall, so way after the Olympics or any summer events (Taylor Swift, festivals, etc). I'm aware of shitty hosts behavior on Airbnb (and how Airbnb has been falling from grace for a few years now). It's just the timing of all the cancelations in only Italy's locations (out of a dozen total locations in 4 countries) that were weird. In conclusion, no new legislation, just bad timing.

Florence Italy Thoughts,"My wife wants to celebrate her 50th at end of April next year in Italy. We will spend a couple of nights in Milan to start and then 5 nights in Florence area before headed to Rome for a couple of nights. With being in the city before and after I am thinking the country side would be good for Florence. Any suggestions of wineries, resorts or farms that also have nice accommodations?  Maybe up to 500euro per night.  Also, with staying outside of Florence what is the best way to get around? Is renting a car the best and how hard is to park and get into Florence? I have read cities and restrict non residents. Also driving back to the countryside at night after enjoying a nice meal and some good wine concerns me.  We will take the train from Milan and to Rome before and after. We will want to visit and dine in Florence, maybe book some day tours with a tour company to the coast, Pisa, Sienna ect which I am guessing will have a meeting point in Florence.

Intra-Italy overnight train _into_ Florence?,"Hello,

Recently I posted a sample itinerary and the input there was really helpful and allowed us to take a couple different looks at our trip.

The last time I was in Europe I took an overnight train and I found it to be really enjoyable and very efficient way to travel. I'm now contemplating this for part of our trip to help us get around better, but I have one big question mark. I see plenty of overnight trains from outside of Italy arriving in Florence in the morning--but I don't see Florence listed anywhere as an arrival point  for an overnight \_within\_ Italy. Is this indeed the case, or am I just missing something? All my searches on this sub pull up results for things like Paris to Florence.",1,7,1723218651.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1eo37so/intraitaly_overnight_train_into_florence/,Tenmaru45
How to for Paris-Milan-Venice-Florence,"Hello all, I posted a few days ago about ideas for a honeymoon trip for my fiancé and I, and I have modified the destinations we are going. We plan on flying in to Paris, and then from there I am open to suggestions on how to order the trip. We would like to do 4 nights in Paris, 4 nights in Florence, 2 nights in Venice, and 3 nights in Milan. What is the most feasible order in doing this trip? We would probably fly out of Venice since there are direct flights to NY which is our home. Also, for traveling between the cities, should we ever use train, or all by plane? She is not a light traveler so we will have massive luggage.

Can fly in to Rome or Milan... But looking at the number of places we feel we may not be able to cover all in these 3 cities.. So thinking may do just Rome and Florence...

We are history and cultural buffs... And we realize we take our sweet time usually, especially in less crowded and peaceful places... 
Do you think it is a good plan, or adding Venice in still makes sense?

"Is Naples a good base in Italy for our honeymoon besides Rome, Florence & Milan?","My husband and I will be going on a 3 week trip to Italy & Spain next April for our honeymoon—we’ll be staying for 13 days in Italy.

Our itinerary consists of visiting Rome, Naples, Florence & Milan but I just saw a post here with comments about Naples that noise & safety might be an issue which might be an issue for us 😅 We are staying 4 days each in all the cities except Milan—just 3 days and we will take a day trip to Lake Como. 

We are planning to make Naples our base for 4 days to go on day trips to Capri & Amalfi Coast. We are into food mostly but we live in a coastal area already so food in Capri & Amalfi Coast might not be the most appealing to us given that we always have fresh seafood already. I also heard it’s also very expensive there and hard to get around the area. Unless it is worth it? I’ve been to Cinque Terre years back and loved it but we just did a day trip from Milan so the travel was very tiring. 

I’m wondering if there are other alternatives or should we just extend our stays in Rome, Florence & Milan and go on day trips from there? And if ever, can you suggest day trips from Rome & Florence?

"Italy Itinerary Advice - Rome, Florence, & Tuscany","Hey r/travel,

Me and my partner are looking at doing a 10-day trip to Italy next April - we want to do Rome for 3 nights, Florence for 3 nights, and then spend some time in Tuscany for 4 nights (no. of nights at each is flexible). In Tuscany we'd like to visit Siena, San Gimignano, Montalcino, and Volterra. We'd also like to spend some time in the countryside, I've heard staying at an agriturismo is a great experience.

We're currently trying to figure out the best order to do this in, and how to travel between each location. We're thinking of flying to Rome (from London), taking a train to Florence, renting a car to visit Tuscany, and then flying out of Florence back to London. I don't know if this is the most 'efficient' way to see all the places we want to visit, and whether we'd be better driving from Rome to Tuscany and then onto Florence.

I can't seem to find any similar itineraries online or if anyone has asked a similar question before, so any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has any recommendations on places to visit or stay that would be great too!

"Frugal but self-sufficient couple on their honeymoon in Florence. Should we spend $1,600 at a Michelin 3 star restaurant?","Hi everyone! My honeymoon is coming up and since it’s also my husband’s birthday month, I’m wondering if we should dine at a Michelin 3 star restaurant (Enoteca Pinchiorri) while we’re in Florence. 

We’re a frugal couple and are not avid foodies, but we also are willing to spend money on (the few) things we think that are worth it. For example, we have the self-control to not spend over $750 on Taylor Swift scalper tickets, but have no problem hiring a videographer for our wedding for $5k.

Our honeymoon itinerary so far is quite NOT luxury. We booked Airbnb all the way averaging $200 daily (all with balcony and a nice view), all economy flights, etc. I came across Enoteca Pinchiorri on Reddit and someone mentioned that for a Michelin three star, it’s not expensive. Neither my husband and I have dined at a Michelin rated restaurant before, so considering the special occasion, I acted fast enough to have secured a table (with 24 hour cancellation policy). 

Now that I have that secured, I did more research and started wondering whether I should give that table to a bigger foodie. The set menu is €390, but the restaurant offers a white truffle add-on that I think we should do. The wine pairings starts at €200 for three glasses. It’s Tuscany — we kinda have to drink some wine. As arguably the biggest wine cellar, the restaurant also offer a tour of the cellar with free champagne for €100. So at a minimum, we’d be spending €1,600. Thankfully tips are not a thing in Italy (correct?)

While I’d be okay spending that much money, it would be a “once in a lifetime” experience, and I would hate it if the whole experience doesn’t live up to the expectation. I know this will be fully subjective, but I wonder, what’s the allure of Michelin restaurants to travelers who are not regular fine diners? Will this “go big or go home (regarding the truffle add on and the wine pairing)” “once in a lifetime” mindset set us up for disappointment?

Thank you so much for reading. Any opinion is much appreciated.

Update: Thank you for all the comments! This is what I needed to hear. As many of you said, Florence has not shortage of good restaurants and it shouldn't cost $1600 for a stellar experience. I will give my reservation to someone else who treasures it!",0,24,1693273292.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1644uv2/frugal_but_selfsufficient_couple_on_their/,maxwon
Northern Italy Trip (Florence-Pisa-Cinque-Turin-Maggiore-Milan),"Hi everyone, I am planning a trip to northern/northeastern Italy this summer. Hoping to get some feedback on my itinerary. Coming from the US and used to traveling at a faster pace (although please be honest if we need to cut out a city or Lake Maggiore). Things we enjoy: Italian food, food tours, nice landscapes & gardens, history tours & museums (eg loved Naples archeology museum and Pompei), less cathedrals (max 2), less art museums (max of 2 for maybe 2 hours each)

Day 1: arrive in Milan at 10am. Immediately take train to Florence so it's not a wasted day sleeping all day in Milan.

Days 2-3: explore Florence. On day 3 afternoon, take train to Pisa, spend a couple hours there, and then take train to Cinque Terra.

Day 4: Cinque Terra

Day 5-6: morning train to Turin, explore Turin

Day 7: rent car in the morning and drive to Lake Maggiore (hopefully the less tourist-overrun version of Como?)

Day 8: drive back to Milan and return car in the morning. Explore Milan.

Day 9: fly out of Milan in the morning

The most quintessentially FRENCH town for a month long stay?,"My husband and I (late 20’s) are dreaming up a month-long work-cation in France (May/June). We’ve done trips like this before in Inverness and Florence and were completely enchanted by their beauty and history. We watched The Hundred Foot Journey the other day, and, with tummies rumbling agreed emphatically that it was time to go to France.

We want to pick a “basecamp” for the month, but the problem is... well… picking it. Every time we think we’ve found the one, we see a picture or hear about a festival or read a forum on the all-knowing Rick Steves’ website, and our confidence falters. Se we need some help. 

Our ideal location would be:

- A landscape photographer’s dream (we’re just getting into it)
- Proud of their food and wine offerings
- Quintessentially French. Think: Oberammergau over Munich 
- Quiet, old, and beautiful
- Accessible, for weekend trips
- Woven into nature
- Modern enough that we could find strong WIFI

Some places that have made our short list:
1. Strasbourg (vineyards, beautiful small town)
2. Aix-en-Provence (lavender fields, small town)
3. Antibes (Hills, swimming?, hikes)
4. Avignon (central, but worried it’s too modern)

If there’s a place you know of that’s charming and fairytale-like, that’s what we’re looking for! I can’t tell you how much I value the opinion of someone who’s been there. So, thanks in advance!

10 Day Italy Tour in May - Itinerary Help! (ROME > FLORENCE > CINQUE TERRE > VARENNA),"Two  very active 30-something Americans who hike a lot and are always trying to be  outside. Neither of us have been to Italy before but we have traveled  abroad, and will be doing this trip out of two 40L backpacks.  We've  booked all of our lodgings and are now trying to hammer out our  day-to-day itineraries - we're prioritizing seeing antiquity /  historical sites, hiking / being outside, and eating as off the beaten path as we can. Less interested in high-end eating or particularly modern exhibits, not interested in shopping other than maybe a couple little things up. Would love suggestions / tips (please rec your fav  local eateries!!) and to know if anything below sounds wildly  unreasonable, thank you for reading!!!

As for research: We've relied a lot on Rick Steves content/forums, I've looked at the Italy guides in this subreddit and other Italy-specific subreddits, and have each scoured various youtube channels. 

**SUNDAY MAY 5 Day 1 (ROME)**

\- Land in Rome 10AM, take train to central train station, probably get our feet on the ground for 10:30-11AM and  start our day.

\-  We're staying in Trastavere, figured we would probably walk from the  train station to our bnb, grab some food on the go, drop our things off  and then head back out.

\- We've  realized the first sunday of the month is free museum day. My initial  pitch was that we should book a slot at the Borghese in the afternoon,  but those tickets aren't available until 10 days before the date. I'm  not sure if this is a good idea or if we should prioritize something  else museum-wise?

\- Otherwise I  think the plan would be doing going to Appian Way Park and wandering in  there and seeing the catacombs before heading back to Trastavere to have  an evening close to our home base. I'm assuming we will still be  jetlagged at this point.

**MONDAY Day 2**

\- Currently have a tour booked for the Vatican first thing in the morning from 10AM - 12:30 PM.

\-  After the Vatican tour we don't have anything booked - I know a lot of  museums are closed on mondays - so I think we'll probably do the forum /  palatine hill / area for the afternoon? Maybe get dinner in Monti and  hit the Trevi Fountain in the evening?

**TUESDAY Day 3**

\-  This day is very much up in the air. We were originally planning a full  day day-trip to Pompeii / Vesuvio, but we're feeling like we should  save this daytrip for a different time since there's plenty to do in  Rome that doesn't involve hours of travel on trains. But we're  conflicted.

\- What would you do with this day?

**WEDNESDAY Day 4 (ROME -> FLORENCE)**

\- Grab breakfast somewhere in the morning, check out of our BNB by 11 and then take a train to Florence.

\-  Our bnb here is in Oltrarno. Planning on walking there from the train  station, not entirely sure when we'll be getting into Florence but  figured we'd grab / stop for food on the way to our bnb and then make  our way back out into the city after we drop everything off.

\- currently thinking of booking tickets to the Accademia this afternoon? And exploring Ponte Vecchio?

**THURSDAY Day 5**

\-  All I have penciled in for this day is walking around Florence. I  haven't booked yet but I think this week I'm going to lock in times for  Duomo and Uffizi Gallery.

\- Otherwise I just have Rick Steve's Renaissance walking tour linked.

**FRIDAY Day 6**

\-  we are going to rent a car and have a Tuscany day. Hoping to be able to  get out as early as possible with the rental (we're aware of the many  various road rules in the historic parts of town) and get out of  Florence. We have a midday reservation at Dario Cecchini's restaurant in  Chianti (a rec from someone we know who went), but otherwise nothing  concrete planned. Very interested in the old towns in Tuscany as well as  the general countryside but not totally sure where to start (Volterra  looks interesting, but far? Would it be worth it?) - help!

\- drop rental car off back in Florence as late as we can, maybe wander around by our bnb, pass out.

**SATURDAY Day 7 (FLORENCE -> CINQUE TERRE)**

\-  Catch a train from Florence to Cinque Terre. Our hotel is in monterosso  al mar and we're not sure if we should take the train all the way  there, drop our things off and then head out? Or maybe get off in  Riomaggiore and take a boat to Monterosso?

**SUNDAY Day 8**

\-  We have a whole day here. Not sure if we should get up early and  immediately set into the whole hiking trail, or if we should take a boat  ride to the end of it and then take the hiking trail BACK towards home  base, popping on and off to grab food and hang out. Have not hammered  out particular stops we want to make here, we just know we want to do  the hike.

**MONDAY Day 9 (CINQUE TERRE -> VARENNA)**

\-  Catch a very specific 10:33 AM train from Monterosso Al Mar to Milan,  catch a connecting train to Varenna (Lake Como) - arrive for around 3:30  PM.

\- Not sure what to do with  this afternoon / evening. We have an agriturismo not too far from the  trai nstation in Varenna. Considering catching a ferry to Bellagio and  wandering around in the villas on that side of the lake? But I'm not  sure how much time that needs

**TUESDAY Day 10**

\-  Potentially the most logistically ambitious part of this trip: getting  up early and catching a local train from Varenna to Lecco, and then  taking a bus to the start of the Mt Resegone hike. Would most likely  hike from the floor to the summit (we've bookmarked a bunch of  trailguides with directions), take a breather at the top and grab a bite  from the restaurant at the peak, and then work our way back down / take  the Gondola as far as we can. I'm not sure if it goes the full way down  or just halfway?

\- Ideally we're  back in Varenna no later than 3PM, although I'm hoping for earlier.  Spend the afternoon in Varenna, do the walk of lovers and see castello  de vizio. Not sure what else??

**WEDNESDAY Day 11 (VARENNA -> MILAN -> SEEYA)**

\-  catch an 8AM train back to Milan so we can make a flight that will take  us to the UK leg of our journey. Might be able to grab a late breakfast  somewhere near the main train station in Milan if you have any recs!",1,9,1712588808.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bz07y7/10_day_italy_tour_in_may_itinerary_help_rome/,IndependentOrnery296
How do you not let a bad experience sour your entire trip,"In Rome currently. Day before yesterday had taken a train to Naples and from Naples to Pompiee. Had a wonderful time. Returned back to Naples, enjoyed a pizza, on the way back to the train station just casually checked my hand to notice that my gold bracelet was missing .

 I recently got married and it was a gift from my grandparents . They wanted me to always wear it. Looks like at some point the bracelet just fell. I have a picture from the time i boarded the train from Rome to Naples where I was wearing it. Post that due to my huge jacket it’s difficult to see.

Since the past 36 hours I’m just replaying where it could’ve fallen , what can I do. But I know it’s just lost and nothing can be done. It was worth a 1000$ and the guilt of wearing it and losing it is bearing hard on me . 

I’m just on day 5 of my trip , don’t want this experience to sour the remaining 15 days .

Good lesson learned though . Don’t travel with valuables :/

Edit:
Thank you for your kind words. I might’ve lost a bracelet but gained priceless insight into the lives and loss of so many wonderful internet strangers. Thanks for sharing your experiences. Addressing a few things:

1. I don’t think my travel insurance covers loss of personal belongings. So I don’t think the financial loss is recoverable. Which is fine, it could be worse.

[Travel insurance coverage](https://imgur.com/f9pPE1p)

2. I’ve currently not informed my family about it. I know they won’t be upset at me but it’ll make them very sad . I’d rather they not feel the sadness that I felt.

3. I got multiple suggestions to file a police complaint.
I’m currently in Florence. Does anyone know if I can file the complaint here? Or does it have to be in Rome/ Naples

4. I’ve dropped an email to Pompei incase something turns up in their lost and found ( unable to reach them On their number)

5. Checked Trenitalia’s online lost and found ,No luck .

6. Tried calling the pizza place, number is switched off 

7. I think I was so careful about my wallet and cellphone that I got distracted from the bracelet. It’s okay, sh!t happens. Will treat this as a 1000$ lesson that’ll probably save me more money in the future. I’m enjoying my time here. My loving husband has been trying to buy me jewellery in Florence to maybe replace my loss. Though I don’t think I’m up for anymore jewellery for some time ;)

It was probably stolen from my hand. Though I’d like to believe that it was lost in the ancient streets of Pompei, and years from now, covered in dust and buried in rubble, it’ll make a budding archaeologist very happy momentarily ",775,234,1702892518.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18l4x7f/how_do_you_not_let_a_bad_experience_sour_your/,Top_Belt_8065

"Italy 14 Day Trip (Late July-August) - Hoping to do Venice, Florence, Rome, and Amalfi - Is it Possible?","Hello, I am looking to plan a honeymoon trip to Italy, probably lasting from mid July to early August where we would have about 14 full travel days in Italy (not including travel to and from). The places we would like to see most are Rome, Florence, Venice, and the Amalfi Coast. We are planning to do most of our travel by train since driving seems a bit difficult in Italy, and I was wondering is this even possible to hit all these places in that span, or would we be stretching ourselves too thin and be too busy? We would probably have to fly into Rome for price/travel point usage reasons, and I know Venice is quite geographically separated from these other regions which likely makes it a bit tougher.

Also a few other questions if anyone is willing to help out further: 

\- Is it going to be too crowded during this time to even enjoy ourselves, or will we be ok if we don't mind a bit of a crowd? 

\- How many days do you think are required to see each of these places effectively? 

\- Does anyone have good hotel recommendations for places that are reasonably priced/centrally located in these regions? I don't need anything fancy, just decent, clean rooms as we probably plan to be moving around most of the time and mostly just sleeping in our hotels. 

\- Also open to any suggestions for activities or places to eat in these areas if you have the time :)

Recommendations- where to stop between Florence and Munich?,"I am planning a trip with a lot of family members for next year.

First, we are going to spend a couple days in Rome and then head to Tuscany. We know that we want to be in Munich 3 days after our stay at the villa for Oktoberfest.

Hi there, I’m looking to visit Italy next weekend, hoping the weather won’t be too bad and need some help with itinerary to see if I should include Verona or not :

9th : Arrive in Venice (morning) 

11th: Leave for Florence 

12th :Day trip to Chianti and Pisa from Florence 

15th :Back to Venice

16th : Flight back from Venice

What would be your recommendation? Also, does it usually rain a lot during this time? I don’t mind if it’s not super warm but hopefully not too cold.

"What I learned during my 34-day trip across Spain, France and Italy.","**Trip summary - 33 nights:**

* Spain: 10 nights in total
   * Madrid: 3 nights
   * Sevilla: 3 nights
   * Granada: 2 nights
   * Barcelona: 2 nights
* France: 6 nights in total
   * Paris: 4 nights (day trip to Versailles)
   * Lyon: 2 nights
* Italy: 15 nights in total
   * Turin: 2 nights
   * Milan: 3 nights (day trip to Lake Como)
   * Venice: 2 nights
   * Bologna: 1 night
   * Florence: 4 nights (two day trips, one to Siena, San Gimignano and Pisa and one to Montepulciano, Pienza and Montalcino)
   * Rome: 3 nights
* Spain: 2 nights in total
   * Madrid: 2 nights

This was my first time organizing a multi-city trip, so even after months of research and organizing, there are some things that I would do way differently.

**What I learned:**

* I live in Panama and we decided to get a round-trip ticket to Madrid because it would be cheaper than flying back from a different city. It sounded doable while we were comfy at home but after a month of non-stop traveling, we realized what a huge mistake that was lol. We were so incredibly tired that we would’ve rather paid more to be able to fly back home right away instead of going back to Madrid first.
* I’m glad I took my time researching and booked popular places months in advance. I traveled in May and the lines were incredibly long, especially in Italy. It was still worth it even when we had to pay a small fee for pre-booking.
* It was a mistake going to Bologna just for one night. We went only because we had an extra night and we thought it’d be cool to go there to try the food since we’d heard so many good things about it. We had breakfast, which was good but nothing out of the ordinary but the real disappointment was dinner. We went to Trattoria da Me because of the good Google reviews, and it was just meh. It would’ve been better to spend an extra night in Rome or Florence. \*\*EDIT: I liked Bologna and would like to go back in the future. I just don't think it was a good idea to pack up all our stuff and travel there just to stay one night, considering we were very tired by that point. The restaurant was disappointing for sure, but I really liked the city and would like to explore the surrounding area one day.
* I saw a lot of advice about not staying just one night in a place because of how tiring it is, so I thought two nights would be fine for the smaller cities. Yeahhh, no. I’ve since learned that three nights is much better and doesn’t make me feel as frazzled as just two nights. YMMV, though.
* The trip was way too long for us. Even though our days weren’t packed full of activities we were still exhausted halfway through the trip. We still enjoyed it, don’t get me wrong, but I think it would’ve been better to just do one country and only two to three weeks max.
* Train travel is awesome! So much less hassle than taking flights and we really appreciated getting to our destination right in the city center.
* I would never travel again with a suitcase for a multi-city trip. I took a backpack and my mom, who is 69 years old, took a carry-on-sized suitcase. I had no issues with my bag but being the good daughter that I am lol I also carried my mom’s luggage and we struggled on public transportation. If you’re planning on taking taxis then this may not apply but I wouldn’t personally do this ever again and taxis may not even be doable in places like Venice where water taxis are insanely expensive.
* If I could travel back in time and rearrange our itinerary this is what I would change while still keeping the same countries and the same amount of nights:
   * Spain: 10 nights in total
      * **Madrid: 4 nights (add a day trip to Toledo or Segovia)**
      * Sevilla: 3 nights
      * **Granada: 3 nights**
      * **(We loved everything we did in Barcelona but the city itself wasn’t very nice. It was crowded and dirty, and we didn’t think it was worth the detour to go there.)**
   * France: 7 nights in total
      * **Paris: 7 nights (three day trips instead of one, one to Versailles, one to Lyon and one to Strasbourg)**
   * Italy: 16 nights in total
      * Milan: 3 nights (day trip to Lake Como)
      * **Venice: 3 nights (add a day trip to Verona)**
      * **Add** **Cinque Terre: 3 nights**
      * Florence: 4 nights **(two day trips, one to Siena and one to Montepulciano, Pienza and Montalcino. Originally we got a guided tour for both trips and while we loved the second one, we think it would’ve been better to just visit Siena on our own.)**
      * Rome: 3 nights
* However, if I could start over from scratch, I would’ve just focused on Italy and left Spain and France for future trips. We did so much because we felt like we had to do as much as possible but now I know that’s not always the best.

Sooo, that's it for now. Overall I still loved our trip and I'm already saving up for our next destination (maybe Japan?).",922,243,1686168487.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/143ngwi/what_i_learned_during_my_34day_trip_across_spain/,lucialorena2

Need some help for Italy inter-state travel (Milan-Florence-Venice),"Hey guys, I am planning to do a 7/8 day trip to Italy Q3 this year with my dear mom and I need some help from from the fams here.  
We are from Malaysia and this is our first time to Italy.  
My mom have been to several EU countries already but Italy seemed to always shy away from her plans.  
Anyway, she will only visit Italy this once, and will probably never come again as she have other places she wants to go. So I hope with this, you will understand why I'm trying to squeeze 3 places to visit in 7/8 days as she wanted to see more.

  
Firstly for context, we will be departing from UK/London as this is our first destination from Malaysia and will most likely depart and return to Gatwick using LCC.  
Currently, our plan is to visit Florence, Venice, and hopefully able to slot in a 2-day stroll in Milan.  
As we have a very limited time, I think we will prefer to use Train? to commute inter-state as we will be able to minimize transit/travelling time.  
So I hope fams here can share with me what would be the best way (in sequence and cost effective) to travel as below:

1. Milan <> Florence/Venice <> Venice/Florence > London
2. Which Train and where should I book them?
3. Anything else I should know?

FYI, Milan does not need to be the first city from London. I'm simply putting it first with the assumption it's the nearest city to Gatwick and would be cheap. Thanks alot!",1,8,1708970131.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1b0nw85/need_some_help_for_italy_interstate_travel/,kevincharmz

Day 8: ? - end in Nice at some point

Day 9: Full day in Nice

Day 10: Flights in the morning

This is only our second trip to a European country so we are still relatively new to traveling, I was hoping to get some insight from anyone who’s done a similar trip. Does this sound like a reasonable plan? Would you spend more or less days in any particular city? We would be open to stretching the trip to a full 2 weeks if need be.

Recommendations for one night in between Florence and Positano,"Hi all,

Seeking recommendations for our honeymoon in Italy. We'll be coming from Florence to the Amalfi Coast. We'll be staying in a hotel a little separated from the hustle and bustle of Positano (no pool, 20 min walk up steps to get to). Because of hotel availability, we will have one free afternoon/night between Florence and Positano (before we check in to our hotel the following afternoon) to stay or do whatever we want. 

A few things rolling around in my head:   
We aren't staying at one of the crazy expensive hotels, which is great. The cost is it's up a hill and doesn't have a pool.   
We will be there for our honeymoon, so I would love to make sure we're doing something romantic, and/or adventurous, and/or relaxing.   
I do love the idea of being able to lounge poolside, or cliffside, with a view. It seems like resort passes are possible for purchase, so we may be able to check that box that way.   
Upon a quick search, I found that you can stay aboard a boat for a night, which could either be epic or catastrophic, depending on the sea.   


Tldr: Does anyone have recommendations for where to stay for a night in between Florence and Positano? Thank you in advance!",2,12,1701314478.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1878gki/recommendations_for_one_night_in_between_florence/,emmadow

2 Nights in Rome (Hotel in the heart of Rome)
  
> Mostly exploration, hitting some of the bigger attractions (Sistine Chapel, Colosseum)


4 Days in Florence (Airbnb right by il Duomo)
  
> Doing a food tour one day and a drinking/night life tour another night. The rest of the time will be left for exploration 

4 Days in the Tuscany Countryside (A resort in Monsummano Terme)  
   
> Will have a rental car these 4 days and some places nearby are:
 
          > 33 min to Luca
          > 48 min to Pisa
          > 1hr 13min to San Gimigano
          >  1h 22 min Volterra
  
> Whether it's a vespa tour or by other means we'd also like to explore the Chianti wine region

Wine in Florence & Rome (when you have kids),"I know there’s a lot of Florence/Tuscany and Rome pros on this sub so figured I’d take a shot here with this question:

What are the best ways to taste wine in these places when you’ve got kids with you? Ours are older grade school aged. They travel a lot and handle themselves well in the company of adults. And while I understand Italians generally love kids I don’t think that means they’re necessarily welcome at wineries or wine bars/enotecas.

So…are there other ways you all can recommend? Maybe restaurants or cafes with great wine programs that are also family-friendly? Maybe tasting rooms or other venues where kids might be able to tag along? Ways I’m not even aware of?

"Finalizing Italy Itinerary: Cinque Terre, Florence/Tuscany, Rome","Hello everybody, my wife and I are finalizing our plans for a 16-day trip (travel days included) to Italy late September of 2022 and wanted to get some insight into our plan. We are pretty laid back travelers and we do not plan to try to see everything in one trip. Instead, we would like to be able to spend a decent amount of time in several locations and try various local cuisines and activities. To be honest, most of our trips are based around food. We usually develop a list of places we really want to eat and fit our daily activities around that.

**Proposed Itinerary**

* Arrive in Rome (FCO) from USA, travel day. Transit to La Spezia to end travel day.
* Move to Riomaggiore, spend 3.5 days in Cinque Terre. Hiking, visiting the 5 towns, maybe sea kayaking or investigating the caves?
* Move to Florence,  5.5 days. 2-3 days in Florence and remaining time spent on day trips to Lucca, Parma, Bologna, others?
* Move to Rome, 5 days.
* Depart Rome (FCO) for USA, travel day. Sadness ensues.

**Our Initial Thoughts**

* I've read over 2 days may be too much in CT, but we think we will like just hanging out and leisurely exploring the towns. The hiking will be relatively strenuous but we hike quite a bit so it is not a put-off. The first day in La Spezia is just an opportunity to see another city and will hopefully avoid the end-of-weekend crowd.
* Florence: Still deciding on whether we want to spend the whole time with Florence as a home-base, or move to another site in Tuscany for a couple days. Having a home base is less effort since we don't need to relocate, but more time will be spent going to-and-from places.
* Rome: We are looking at a hotel in the Celio/Esquilino/Ripa area as it seems like a good location to reach a lot of sites and has access to the metro. Any reason to not stay in this area?
* Duration for Florence and Rome: We have an even split between Rome and Florence. Part of me is tempted to spend do an extra day in Florence to do another day trip or wine tasting, but neither of us are art connoisseurs (we like art, but don't plan on spending entire days at art museums). We have read both areas have good food, but is one especially known for certain dishes?

Any feedback on our plan would be appreciated. I know it is up to us at the end of the day, but we want to make sure we aren't overlooking anything (moving from city to city is harder than we think, \_\_\_\_ place needs more or less time, etc.). 

We would also be grateful for any suggestions, whether it be activities, food (best pesto around? Lesser known must-try local dishes?), drinks, or anything else.

Travelling to Barcelona - Florence - Cinque Terre - Rome,"Hi all,

We're going to Europe in August and in the last leg of our trip, we'll be flying from Barcelona into Italy and are  planning to go to Florence (2 nights in a wine resort), Cinque Terre (2 nights) and Rome (3 nights).

Day 1: Arrive in Europe (CDG), and transfer to FCO.

"Planning a family trip that includes my 7 year old sister. Is going to Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka) or going to France (Paris)/Italy (Venice, Florence, Cinque Terre, Rome) a better idea?","Hi everyone!

Me and my family have been planning a family vacation since we all love to travel. It is my first time getting out of the continent, and I'm really excited, however, we have recently faced some doubts.

For context, I'm a high schooler, and about two years ago me and my family were going to go to Japan, because ever since I was 6 year old I really wanted to visit Japan. We already had the plane tickets and everything, but COVID hit so we had to postpone our plans.

Now, two years have passed and we are planning a 12 day trip in October of this year (2023), however, after some consideration, even though my mom is super excited about the idea of going to Japan (probably even more than me honestly), she has had the worry that going to Japan might not be that good of an idea. This is because I have a 7 year old sister, and since we are going for so many days, my parents don't really want to leave her with anybody, so we forcefully have to take her with us. 

Now, bringing a 7 year old to our trip changes a lot of things for us. We now have to take her into consideration, and that is what worries my mom a lot. When our family travels, we usually like to wake up really early, go to lots of different places within walking distance, and go to places such as museums. We aren't really sure if my sister could handle this. 

Because of this my dad (who has always wanted to go to Italy and didn't really want to go to Japan that much anyways) proposed that we should instead go to France (Paris) and Italy (Venice, Florence, Cinque Terre, Rome) instead. Although this initially made me kind of sad (considering I have wanted to go to Japan ever since I was 6 years old), after thinking about it, I think it might honestly be the best thing for us for a few reasons:

For starters, since it is a family trip, if we went to Japan, I would have to take into account what my family wants, which will probably diminish my experience. For example, if my mom and my dad don't want to go somewhere that I really want to go, I can't really make them go since that would be really selfish. Another thing is that we can't do much stuff that would be boring for my sister (such as walking or going to museums), and when planning activities, we have to take into consideration that she doesn't get too tired. 

The other reason is that going to France/Italy would be a cheaper trip, so my parents offered me as a bonus that they could also send me to a New York trip alone with a friend of mine who is also going, which honestly sounds really sweet. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post. Taking into consideration me, my parents, and my sister, what would be best for us? Thank you in advance!",5,18,1683487952.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13b09z5/planning_a_family_trip_that_includes_my_7_year/,_Mexican_Soda_

1. Any hotel or neighborhood recommendations for Florence and Rome? I'm looking to stay in the range of 150-300 euros/night, ideally on the lower end if possible. Trastevere in Rome looks particularly attractive due to the number of good restaurants, but open to all ideas.
2. Any restaurant or wine bar recommendations in Florence, Rome, and Siena? I am planning on going to Osteria dell'Enoteca for a Bistecca alla Fiorentina in Florence and Nannarella, Tonnarello, or CiPASSO in Rome, but that's all I've found that looked authentic and reasonably priced. Also, is da Enzo in Rome worth the hype?
3. My fiancee and I are SUPER into wine, particularly reds. What winery recommendations do you have near Montalcino? We will be staying on a farm near Montalcino so it would be best to have <30 min drive.
4. Does anyone have an recommendations for spas or spa treatments in Bagno Vignoni in Tuscany? I see the ADLER spa, but it looks very pricey. We're hoping to dip in the spa and potentially have a treatment.
5. My fiancee and I like art, but are more interested in modern art, science, and technology. Which museums should we go to in Florence? I saw there's a Leonardo Da Vinci Museum but not sure if it's any good.
6. While in Sorrento, we will take a day trip to Pompeii and Vesuvius, but will have more time that day to do other things. Is it worth going into Naples for a half day or would it be better to do a local cooking class or go to Herculaneum? Or other suggestions?

Option 1:
* Land in Rome, stay 2 nights.
* Rent car in Rome, drive to Agriturismo. Stop on Orvieto for lunch. Stay 2-3 nights.
* Drive to Florence, return car. Stay 2-3 nights
* Depart FLR

Option 2:
* Land in Rome, stay 2 nights.
* Take train from Rome to Chiusi. Rent car in Chiusi, drive to Agriturismo. Stay 2-3 nights.
* Drive to Florence, return car. Stay 2-3 nights
* Depart FLR

Option 3:
* Land in Rome, stay 2 nights.
* Take train from Rome to Florence, stay 2-3 nights.
* Rent car in Florence, drive to Agriturismo, stay 2-3 nights.
* Drive from Agriturismo to FLR airport. Return car and depart flight at 6:35pm

Option 4:
* Land in Rome, stay 2 nights.
* Train to Florence, rent car in Florence, drive to Agriturismo, stay 2-3 nights. (seems like a lot of travel in one day)
* Drive back to Florence, return car, stay 2-3 nights
* Depart from FLR


Does it matter to be in Florence over the weekend instead of weekdays for nightlife?


Extra Notes for fun:
- I have been to Rome but my gf hasn’t so 2 nights is us meeting in the middle
- Neither of us have been to Tuscany
- We both LOVE wine (live near Williamette Valley, spend lots of time wine tasting). From this area mostly Chianti and Montepulciano. Please send your favorite wineries :-)
- I prefer less tannic wines. Because of that leaning more towards Montepulciano than Montalcino since Brunello is usually more tannic (I think?)
- If anyone has an Agriturismo to recommend I’ll take it! *Especially if you know they are LGB friendly. My gf and I are two pretty femmes late 20s.

1. London (there are just so many iconic sights, we love the food, the fact that you can actually speak English - which is our favorite language & easy for menus in restaurants, and it's close to the Netherlands - where we live, so easy to reach by train)
2. Porto (you're close to the ocean; the views are amazing, good food, weather is almost always good, city is compact; even though there's plenty to see and also close to Lisbon in case you wanna combine the two.
3. Lisbon (well, there's a reason why I'd consider Portugal one of our favorite destinations, both Lisbon and Porto are fabulous - there's even more to do in Lisbon, many view points throughout the city, even better weather, and a great base to see Sintra, or other great parts of Portugal)
4. Rome (I proposed to my husband there and from when I was a teenager I knew I would propose to someone there in the future - it's just so romantic and full of iconic history.... the food....the weather, and the people are super kind).
5. Paris. (I was thinking of putting down Annecy, since I do prefer the nature there, but Paris....there's just so much to do on every corner. Like Rome, it's crazy romantic & it's easy to reach by train from the Netherlands).

**Cities I'd love to visit:**

1. Salzburg (Vienna is another city in Austria I'd love to see one day, but there's just something about Salzburg, it looks magical and the nature alone is a big reason why I'd love to visit one day).
2. Prague (I'm a photographer and there are just so many people recommending the city since it's one of the most photogenic cities in Europe....so we've decided to travel there next september!)
3. Florence (I've seen pictures and I know that there's plenty to do, so I can't wait to see the city for myself in the future - I'll take any excuse to go to Italy, lol)
4. Edinburgh (I mean....we do love the cobbled streets, Harry Potter, the Highlands around the city, so it's high on our list for sure - it will make a good base to visit a bit of Scotland.
5. Nice (we'd love to explore the Cote D'azur - and we're going to next january!)

&#x200B;

Only wanted to mention 5, but there are certainly other cities on our list; there's just not a big rush to get there (cities like Copenhagen, Venice, Dublin, Vienna, Madrid, Stockholm, Bordeaux, Seville).

"College Student traveling to Florence, Italy with layover in Amsterdam - eSIM or Verizon TravelPass or both?","Hello all,

My daughter is traveling / study abroad for a week in Tuscany (Florence). I’ve been researching plans for mobile service. This is the first time she’s ever traveled without us. Yes, she’s in college, but we want to make sure it’s a seemless process that’s enjoyable to the max. 

TravelPass is $10/day but you’re restricted to 0.5gb/day for data. I don’t know how much WiFi access she’ll have and I want to make sure she can send photos, social media, and all that jazz. 

First, is it best to use TravelPass (Verizon’s plan for data with unlimited phone and text) or get an e-SIM from one of these third party apps like Airalo or Ubigi or a combination of both?

She has a 3 hour layover in at Amsterdam Airport, Schiphol  (they cannot leave the airport - sucks for them) - I assume there is WiFi there but if I do the e-SIM should I make sure it covers multiple areas (including Amsterdam) or just Florence? They stay in Florence for the entire trip. Mostly walking to museums, dining, and a nice looking hostel. 

She has an iPhone 13 pro (Verizon, unlocked). Thanks in advance! We’ve never been out of the country and this is her first time flying since she was a toddler.",6,34,1645927514.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/t2d8by/college_student_traveling_to_florence_italy_with/,soxfan04
"What's the one thing you wish you knew BEFORE traveling to Italy? (Rome, Florence, Cinque Terre, Venice)","My wife and I are traveling to Italy later this month, spending 3-5 days in each of the above locations. We've read the guidebooks and recent /r/travel posts on Italy (loved last week's discussion about Venice!) and we're looking for any *specific* tips related to these destinations.

Considerations:

1) Itinerary and lodgings are set; don't suggest alternate destinations. We'll be traveling between cities via train.

2) We do not speak Italian, although my wife is fluent in Spanish and I know French. We are both experienced foreign travelers.

3) We enjoy walking and exploring neighborhoods, getting off the beaten path. We generally avoid crowds, although we like to people-watch sometimes.

4) My wife enjoys food and I enjoy photography. We both enjoy museums (art and historical), markets, and local artisans. 

5) Positive (do this!) and negative (*don't* do this!) advice are both welcome. 

Thanks!",50,74,1433778996.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/391iq5/whats_the_one_thing_you_wish_you_knew_before/,kpcnsk

4 days Croatia vs Prague/Budapest vs Rome/Florence,"Planning to visit one of the above option after Tomorrowland this summer. I’ll be mostly solo traveling or traveling with a buddy and will be quite tired from Tomorrowland. 

Not really looking to party or get wasted. Down to take it easy, explore new cities, etc.

Which one would you recommend? If for Croatia, which of the cities would you recommend for a 4 day trip? 

Likely will fly from Belgium on Tuesday morning to one of these locations and fly out to Lisbon on Saturday.",6,18,1680590168.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/12bb2fz/4_days_croatia_vs_praguebudapest_vs_romeflorence/,austiny6
"12 days in Milan, Florence, and Rome",Highly recommend going in early November. It was warm for this time of year getting up into the 60s most days. Tourist spots were still quite crowded but not awful at all.,59,2,1699913819.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17ummts,RemotePersimmon678

"3 week trip to Portugal, Spain and Italy, we want to choose one city in each.","We're planning a 3 week vacation for October and want to visit the countries listed above. This is our first time in any of them and we're hoping to get a feeling for the culture, eat good food, and try not to go crazy seeing ""everything"". To make it less hectic we're trying to choose one city in each to stay in, and maybe do day trips. Current choices:

Portugal -Porto - easy trips to the Douro, less hectic than Lisbon but still has flights to Barcelona 
Italy - Florence - amazing food and wine, Tuscan countryside is right there. Train access to Cinque terra and other places for day trips.

Spain: this is the tough one. We've heard amazing things about Granada for the beautiful architecture, flamenco history, and amazing tapas, but also want to see Barcelona for the Gaudi and art museums. Granada has no direct flights from the other countries so it's a bit less practical.

Maybe this whole thing is too crazy? Hoping to get some advice from people who have been there.

Any advice appreciated.",398,502,1689161220.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14xluoo/3_week_trip_to_portugal_spain_and_italy_we_want/,Cats_4_eva
