Why do people don't like Paris,"I've spent 9 days in Paris and it was just awesome. I am 20yo female with little knowledge of French, but no one disrespected me or was rude to me. I don't understand why people say French are rude or don't like Paris.
To me Paris is a clean city. I come from south America and there definitely the city is dirty and smells bad, but Paris was just normal for a metropolitan city. 
I understand French people have their way of being. Politeness is KEY. Always I was arriving in places speaking in my limited french ""bonjour, si vous plais je vous prendre.."" and people would even help me by correcting when I say something wrong. But always in a kind way they would do that, smiling and attentive. 

So I really liked everything, Parisienne people were polite and i could even engage in conversations with French people

Paris Charles-de-Gaule (CDG) Airport feels like punishment,"As a frequent European traveler, I used to avoid Frankfurt (FRA) and Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS) airports because it takes ages to get from A to B and the experience can get messy. Until I got to CDG today. Goodness! The layout of this airport is confusing even for the seasoned travelers. I've spent 2,5 out of 3 hours walking from A to B, queuing and then walking some more to C to D. I never stood in so many queues in my entire life! Even the restrooms had queues because some of them were out of order. Forget about unwinding and enjoying a coffee before departure. By the time I finally got to my gate, it was boarding time. Goodness, what an adventure! I used to fear Los Angeles (LAX) or Chicago O'Hare (ORD) airports but even those airports surprised me positively. Now I have a top 3 worst European airports.

Maybe I was too worried about pickpockets in Paris,"I arrived in Paris and after watching videos I was convinced the place was crawling with pickpockets.  The metro was full of people coming out of CDG and I was sure they were after my stuff.  Most were young men, prime suspects in my eyes.  I pulled my phone out of my pocket, and in doing so my wallet got dragged along with it and fell to the ground.  Immediately 3 people standing around me said ""Sir"" (in English) and pointed to the ground.

A scam at Paris CDG Airport and how I dealt with it.,"So I was at Paris CDG today catching a flight, going to the gate and to the end of the line, when a guy approaches me asking if I speak English, then he asks if I speak American, Scottish, whatever which was weird. And I say American? The he says he lost his stuff and needs money to go to the US consulate. He says he needs €10 cash. So I say ""ok, follow me"" and I'm walking in the direction of security. As I'm walking to security, he says, ""No the cash machine is this way"" And I say, ""yes I know, follow me"" When he realises I'm walking to security. He says, ""oh it's okay and runs off"" And I just laughed

"Air France let us onto a plane with our purchased tickets, then pulled us off citing, ""we can't find your tickets"", sent our two (empty) seats direct to our home town in North Carolina, USA, then stranded us in Paris during the Olympics.  Now nobody is responding to our request for reimbursement.","What can we do here?

Our original flight was out of Glasgow on a Saturday in August with British Airways, booked through American Airlines.  We got a ""flight cancelled"" notification at 4am, and that we had to drive to Edenborough to fly out the next morning instead with Air France.  When we got there, we had some issues getting onto the connecting flight to Paris, but they let us on.  When we landed in Paris, we 100% verified with the Air France desk that they had our tickets, and the lady confirmed and showed us on her computer that our names were on 2 seats and that we'd have no issue.

We waited the 4-hour layover for our plane to take off, reassured we'd have no more issues.  We had a little issue getting onto the plane, but again, they let us on.  When we were sitting down choosing which Harry Potter we wanted to watch, the intercom said, ""X and Y, gather your belongings and exit the aircraft"".  We did, and the Air France employees at the gate explained to us that they couldn't find our tickets, and couldn't help us because we needed to talk to American Airlines.  I asked them to confirm that they a) let us onto the plane, b) pulled us off right before takeoff even though Air France confirmed our seats, and c) were going to strand us in Paris and say it's not their fault... and they said, ""yes"".

Two days later, we were finally able to get American airlines to fly us home, but not after spending hundreds of extra dollars and a ton of frustration.  We've tried to reach out to Air France and even the US Transport authority, but nobody seems to care at all about us or what happened to us.

Does anyone know of a good way to get reimbursement for this nightmare that was not our fault?

"Paris, France ","Was in Paris last weekend such an amazing city , but not the right time to go ig . The whole city is gearing up for Olympics, a lot of construction work going on. The sites were nice , desserts were amazing, public transport okayish but I wanted to bring up an incident related to a restaurant.

We went to a restaurant around 7PM, we were there solely for desserts but since we were tired we ordered some starters and a Champaign as well then the waiter came in and asked for the next order and we told him that we'll be ordering desserts, he got super offended that we weren't ordering any main courses and asked us if we'd told the same to the manager before we got assigned the table.... Then he went to get the manager, the manager came in and told us that it's a ""dinner"" restraunt and it's mandatory to take a main course. The smile on their faces completely disappeared and there was a visible frustration but he reluctantly let us get desserts mentioning that he'll be allowing this to happen only for this one time. The bill was already €75, idk how much more he was expecting.

I hadn't experienced anything like this before, is this common? Am I wrong here for not knowing the restraunt rules in Paris. Does it happen often?",1215,116,1720035837.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dunbm2,Acrobatic_Oven_1108

"2 week Euro-trip: Iceland, Paris, Chamonix (French Alps), Copenhagen","Went on a two week December vacation to Europe. 

Iceland has incredible nature that we really enjoyed experiencing in winter. Highly recommend Sky Lagoon in addition to Blue Lagoon. Rented a car and did a bit of exploring of the south coast.

Paris was a long dream of mine since I studied French in college and has always been fascinated by French history. Adored the architecture, but even though I spoke French, people weren’t all that friendly. Tried escargot for the first time (not bad!) and did all the touristy things - Versailles, Louvre, Eiffel Tower etc.

Chamonix was a snowboarder’s dream. Huge mountain with all the fun that ski-towns have to offer. We were there still in early season, but the potential is obvious. Towering mountains! Lots of melted cheese and fantastic fresh bread. Though apparently polite line-forming and waiting for your turn to get on the lift isn’t a thing. 

Copenhagen - our favorite place that inspired our next trip that includes a tour of all Scandinavian countries. Lovely people, delicious food, hygge lifestyle, stylish humans, gorgeous architecture. I thought French pastries would be the best, but Danish outdo them by a mile. As a Ukrainian, really appreciated Danish support - 10 Ukrainian flags for each Danish one - made me tear up multiple times - thank you! 

We got stuck in Iceland on our way back for 5 days, without ever being able to leave the hotel /airport - I can write up a whole novel on the horrid experience , but all I can say is that we’ll never fly Iceland Air again.",3507,105,1672064822.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/zvo7tc,IryBunny
Forced to pay a fee to remain on an overbooked flight from Chicago to Paris,"Myself and a few friends have a trip planned to Paris this next week with a direct flight leaving tomorrow from O’Hare in the evening with Air France. However, we just received an email saying that we lost our seat assignments and that we would now have a layover in Detroit with a new flight. After hours on hold with customer service, we find out the plane has been overbooked and we need to pay a fee (almost $1000) to keep our seats on the original flight. Does this not seem fishy to anyone? I thought overbooking only happened the day of when people were checking in and boarding.

EDIT: Looks like we were first on the chopping block for overbooking due to us receiving a “promotional” rate that somehow made us less secure in our seats. The airline originally offered to allow us to pay the difference to become not promotional and keep the seats. However, I guess that was no longer even an option due to there not even being seats for that. So long story short, we’re going to have to deal with the Detroit layover and fight for reimbursement.",600,68,1747433737.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kodfmb/forced_to_pay_a_fee_to_remain_on_an_overbooked/,orbitapple13

I fell in love in Paris,"I visited a restaurant on my very first evening in Paris. 
I chose it according to the reviews on the internet.
It turned out to be a real gem.
Hidden from tourists, cosy, small and a touch of being at home to it.
A guy greeted me upon arriving and showed me to a table. There was no one else there. We made eye contact and he kept smiling at me. He was so cute and attractive especially when smiling since his whole face opened up.
After about 20 minutes, his grandmother came in and he introduced me to her. He invited her to sit near me and have her supper with me. At this time, I was trying to choose a dessert and she helped me. She suggested I try The Vrai Pain Perdu for an authentic French culinary experience.

Any way, I left and returmed after a few days. I was greeted by a man whom I learnt afterwards that it was his father (father and son run the restaurant). I was disappointed he wasn't there, but hey-ho. After about 20 minutes, he makes his way in and looks straight at me. He visited my table asking me for my orders and helping me with my menu. He smiled at me and won me over with his smile. Upon leaving, he said Bonne soirée to me and that was it.

I didn't know how to act on this without seeming too forward. I do keep thinking about him though and I miss his smile.

Just thought I'd share this.

Girls trip to Paris in January.

Our idea was 5 days in Nice where we can enjoy the ocean and venture out to other towns along the riviera and then 3-4 days in Paris. I'm seeing all over social media a different protest every week, riots, and a lot of crime. We are from NYC and like to relax on vacation to escape the chaos and I honestly cannot see us enjoying being in a city that is pretty similar in terms of relaxation and safety. Should we just do more days in French Riviera or do Lyon instead? Any advice is appreciated thanks!

I keep getting stopped at the US border and I just found it’s because of multiple “no shows”?,"I had just flown back to my hometown in Canada to visit after living in Europe for half a year. There was a good priced flight with a layover in Washington DC, which I didn’t think was gonna be a big deal. Luckily I had chosen the flight with a layover of 3 hours because I would’ve missed my connecting flight if I had chosen the 1h30m one. I flew Paris to Washington and final destination being Toronto. When I got off in Washington, I realized I had to go through US customs to get to my connecting flight gate.

It was 8PM, not many people there and of course I get stopped. They put my passport in a locked security case and sent me to a room for questioning. No one was else was in the room but me so I sat there waiting while the worker looked through my file for a good 5-10 minutes and eventually started questioning my whole life story. “Where are you from? Where do you live now? What do you do for work? Explain your job to me.” Then the questions started getting more intense. “Where are your clients? How do you get your clients? Can you show me examples of your work?” He wanted me to show him my portfolio as I worked in the creative industry, and explain each project. I was thinking to myself that this was insane, he asked for my portfolio? Are these questions normal? 

Eventually I got sent to another officer for them to look through my entire suitcase and backpack while being asked my life story again. Same questions while i’m being questioned about the contents of my baggage.

I had gone through this once before 9 years ago when I went to NY, and I have no idea why. I thought at that time that it was a random questioning because that was the first time I had travelled alone. Since then, there had been a few incidents where I had been questioned a bit longer than usual at the border but it was nothing compared to this. It had stopped after the last 2 times I had visited the US so I thought I was fine. After those last 2 times, I hadn’t really had to go through the US or visited so I had a nice quiet period until today.

The officer had informed me that I was being questioned because of my “big number of no shows for flights” and asked me about every trip I’ve made to and through the US. He said he’s asking me all these questions to make sure my story is right…. Whatever that means. I had told him there was only 2 incidents I could think of that was a “no show”. One being me booking another flight a few days before my current one to go home earlier. The other being that I had missed the fight because I didn’t make the baggage check in time but had still gotten on the flight right after. The officer said that it doesn’t show my on my record the reason why there’s a no show but it just shows multiple no shows. I don’t even know what the other number of no shows would’ve been but now with this on my file I don’t even want to set foot in the US again and have to go through this.

Has this happened to anyone? Any advice, I have another layover in Chicago to go back to Europe next week and I am really not looking forward to that.",2965,229,1745062953.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k2ud56/i_keep_getting_stopped_at_the_us_border_and_i/,security000

The amazing Paris police and people,"Long story short-ish: My family and I were pickpocketed and involved in a physical altercation on a very crowded paris metro by a few individuals as we were getting off and thankfully there were police officers undercover at the same station. some of them stayed with us and the others went to catch the thieves with my phone. My phone was recovered quickly and the police did their job extremely well and efficiently . They were very kind, sweet and trying to cheer me up even though their english is obviously not fluent (my french is non existent so we had to communicate in simple english and google translate which made everything more wholesome). I am so grateful to team for putting in so much genuine effort and care into my situation, the whole ordeal took 5 hours (statements, investigations  etc) of their night time  just for my one shabby phone. Though I do have many important things on my phone and am still travelling for the next 3 weeks LMAO. Everyone including the officers at the station were just absolutely fantastic and nice I honestly cannot sing their praises enough. I wish I could give more details about what happened but I think it’s unsafe for the officers as their identities need to be protected if they work undercover.

I would also like to say that the people of Paris are absolutely wonderful from the bottom of my heart. The moment we realised that we were getting robbed and when the physical altercation happened to us, the Parisians gathered around us to protect us from them. There was this one french lady with a grey pixie cut that stayed with us immediately after the situation and alerted the nearby security guard who alerted the police nearby. I think without her help, her telling us what to do next, helping translate with the security guard and comforting us, the situation would have definitely not turned out so favourably. so thank you very much whoever you are I am so grateful to you too. 

In conclusion, despite the initial unfortunate incident there was a great display of cooperation and humanity seen by the parisian police and parisian people.

How much time would you spend in big cities like Paris and Rome?,"My wife and I are finally going to Europe this September after initial visa rejection. 

Our plan is to visit Paris (5 nights, landing at 9PM the first night), Amsterdam (2 nights), Prague (3 nights), Rome (5 nights), Florence (2 nights) and then flight from Milan. 

Last year we went to Istanbul and Cappadocia and while we really enjoyed 6 nights in Istanbul, 2 nights were enough for us in Cappadocia, it got boring. What we liked in Istanbul was just walking on streets with those little alleyways, nightlife, the beauty of the city, and food. 

Are we spending too much time in Paris and Rome? Would we be bored there?

I’m planning a 4–5 day mom -daughter trip to Paris with my 13-year-old daughter. It’ll be just the two of us, and I’d love advice on our itinerary and where to stay that’s safe, walkable, and close to main sights.

We’re considering either late May/early June or July—any thoughts on which is better?

Here’s what we’d like to do:
	•	Arc de Triomphe & Champs-Élysées
	•	Place de la Concorde
	•	Sainte-Chapelle
	•	Louvre or Musée d’Orsay
	•	Les Catacombes
	•	Seine river cruise

We’re mid-range travelers (not budget but not luxury either). Also wondering:
	•	Are there safe and convenient areas or hotels you’d recommend for families?
	•	Is it realistic to add a 2-day side trip to Amsterdam? We have a friend there we could stay with.

Thanks in advance—we’re excited but want to plan this right!

What DIDN'T you do while traveling to a place that would make another traveler cringe?,"I was inspired to post this after a recent conversation with someone discussing my travels, and their reaction ""What, you DIDN'T do X in Y?"". 

Here are mine:

**New Zealand**

I didn't visit anything related to Lord of the Rings, because I've never seen it. 



**Paris, France**

I didn't visit the Lourve. I do appreciate art but really hate the idea of waiting in line somewhere crowded. I did walk around above it. 



**Patagonia (Bariloche, Argentina)**

I didn't really go for any hikes. I am fit and like exercise, but really don't enjoy hiking. We went for what I would describe as a nature walk. Instead, we stayed at a luxury resort on the lake and looked at the mountains from the comfort of my pool chair, or through the glass of the hotel gym.

"City for solo travel as a 40f - Rome or Paris? Looking for somewhere I can feel safe walking around alone, eat great food, and try to stay on a low-ish budget.","Context: I've lived in Germany for over a decade. My cousin and uncle are doing a trip to Europe for her 16th birthday, and I want to meet up with them along their journey for a couple of days since it's close by (which they are totally cool with). Two of their destinations are Paris and Rome, neither of which I've been to before. My husband will be staying home with our kid, so I'm travelling solo, which I actually really enjoy.

My uncle and cousin are pretty much booked up during their days with tours and day trips, so I'll mostly just see them for breakfast and/or dinner each day. Either way, it's a weekend in July.

Travel and hotel costs from where I live are pretty comparable. I'm wondering which city will be more worth it to explore on foot, and to eat my way through. I could do either a Fri-Sun in Paris, or a Sat-Tues in Rome. Mostly I'm interested in the food and architecture, but might hit an art museum, or do a cheesy hop-on-hop-off bus thing (they're kind of silly, but I really enjoyed the one I did in Madrid years ago).

I probably won't be able to afford hotels super close to where my family is staying - it's last minute, and they have a bigger budget for sure - so I also want to stay somewhere where I'll feel safe walking alone at night.

Weigh in! What city would you choose, and why? Bonus points for good tips on your chosen city, especially cheap/free cultural experiences!

The other big one is work colleagues who won’t travel to Asia unless they can spend at least two weeks there (because it’s so far away) yet have no issues visiting Argentina on a one week trip because “its in the same time zone.”

"Mother daughter trip in early December - Paris, Portugal or Spain?","My daughter is 21 and will be studying in London. Her program ends Dec 6th. I live in the Pacific NW of US (West Coast) and I will meet up with her. I don't need to fly to London first unless logistically it makes sense; she feels comfortable meeting me at our destination. We are looking to travel for 7-8 days.

We've been to London before as a whole family. Otherwise, no other European countries.

Our interests include the local culture, history (including any religious history in the area), good quality food but doesn't need to be high end, daughter loves vintage shopping and bookstores, old and modern architecture and modern art. We love Christmas decorations but we don't have a high interest in Christmas markets. She and I have a high energy for travel and are up for a lot of walking.

Paris seems like a quintessential mother-daughter trip with museums, shopping and food. She might visit Paris for a weekend during her time in London, but she assures me it would only be for about 2 days, so she would still be very excited to go. Since our trip will be 7-8 days, it seems nice to stay in one location and explore it more in-depth.

Portugal - would probably check out 2 locations. Always wanted to visit. Lisbon would be one place, and then choosing between Porto (risk of rain??) or Algarve (low season??? some people love, some people don't).

Spain - Andalusia - Probably the best weather of all three locations. I am completely intrigued by this area. I am afraid that with our preferred time frame, that we will really need to pair down on the itinerary. I don't want to bounce from place to place every night. I also hope to come here as a family (I have a husband and son too), so maybe we save this for another trip when we can all be included and spend more time? But it does sound amazing, so it is still on the list.

A positive for Portugal or Spain for my daughter is that she won't be visiting either one during her time in London, so they will be new to her.

Would love any opinions! Thank you!",17,35,1747008970.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kkfb1o/mother_daughter_trip_in_early_december_paris/,tela_wilson_555
"Copenhagen or Paris (traveling solo in Aug/Sept, 35f)","I'm looking to take a solo trip for about a week around Labor Day. Currently there are inexpensive flights to both Copenhagen and Paris for the same dates and I'm looking to get some advice.

I mostly enjoy exploring cities but don't mind getting out of the city and spending time in nature as well. Museums, cafes, long walks, and live music are all things I enjoy while traveling. I don't typically do a lot of excursions but one or two is fine. I'm very comfortable navigating public transportation. I travel pretty inexpensively but will splurge if there's something I really want to do.

I've done very little research so far and am just looking to get some general opinions on which people prefer between the two cities. Thanks in advance!",5,37,1746733743.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1khzdw0/copenhagen_or_paris_traveling_solo_in_augsept_35f/,Such_Event_8173
Is Paris / France in general worth visiting during the winter?,"My girlfriend and I have been thinking about traveling to France (from the US) this winter during our winter break from college. The reason winter (January specifically) is convenient is because of the much cheaper winter flights. However, I do not want the intriguing cheaper flights to factor out the quality of the trip. I want us to have a great time and I feel like it may just be too cold during January to have that good of a time.

I have travelled to Europe twice before but she hasn't, and I want her first experience to be enjoyable, and I think warm weather in the summer would make her experience a lot better.  I'm not saying that we wouldn't still have a great time even if it's cold outside, but I think you get what I'm saying.

Do you think its worth it to pay the extra expensive summer flight costs to have a more enjoyable trip, or do you think France is worth visiting during the winter?

Have you got to the point where you’d rather return to the same countries over and over instead of visiting somewhere new?,"I’ve been fortunate enough to travel quite a bit but haven’t exactly visited everywhere around the world. 

But recently my desire to see the entire world has subsided and I’d much rather revisit the countries that I have enjoyed the most. For me that’s Japan, Switzerland, Iceland. And maybe also France and Italy. 

I just think that returning feels like I can slow down and really enjoy the parts of the country that I missed the first time. And I’ll be guaranteed to enjoy the trip since I know what’s in store and I already love the culture, food and scenery. Planning is more fun and less stressful than trying to figure out a brand new country.

I travel alot alone here in my country (Brazil), but this time I'm speding my vacation in Prague and Viena, but I'll have a 12 hour wait time for my connection in Paris (CDG). I've asked my friends who have been to Europe and all of them have a different opinion.

I am not taking any dispatched baggages, I only have the hand and regular baggage, so I won't be carrying any big weights.

It seems that the airport is quite far from the city, and it might be dangerous. I've checked and it seems theres no riots or strikes in Paris atm, but will be checking as well. What do you say?

Is it fine to just go and take a look or should I definetely be just waiting at the Charles de Gaulle?

London to Paris day and half trip. Pro/con,"I guess it falls under more of a convinced me not to regret doing this.  We have a five day trip planned to London. The four of us, husband, wife, 18 and 22-year-old have never been abroad.  Looking at the itinerary we are considering going to Paris via the Euro train for a day and a half.  We would stay over one night.  The euro train cost for the four of us is $1800. On one hand that’s a good chunk of money.  On the other hand, this is an opportunity to see the Eiffel Tower and visit the Louvre.  
Our trip is for the (Dec) 25th through the 30th. Due you do some other constraints, We are looking to travel to Paris on the morning of the 28th and come back on the 29th.
I’ve always lived by the adage. There will be time to make more money, but the experience opportunities may not come again.

Going to Paris for 5 days - where else should we visit?,"My best friend and I are doing a girl's trip this summer. Probably just the two of us and we're looking at early Sept. We are planning to do 5 days in Paris but we have about 2 weeks of flexibility around that and would love some advice on where to hit outside of those 5 days. Here are some thoughts we've had so far: 

• Switzerland (flying into Zurich is cheap): see Matterhorn, the bridges, maybe a castle?

• Normandy: Mont Saint-Michel and Falaise d'Aval

• Bordeaux

• Carcassonne 

• Dordogne: would love to see it but can't tell how difficult it is to get there by train 


We have a fairly flexible budget but not trying to break the bank and neither of us wants to drive so we'll be relying on trains, planes, and automobiles-driven-by-other-people during our trip.

Is A Quick Long Weekend Paris Trip Worth It,"I’m planning on doing a trip to Paris from the US next month due to long weekend. Monday is holiday at my office. I’m planning on taking the Friday off, leave office at early noon to catch an evening flight. I’ll be in Paris at around 9:30 (no layovers). I’ll have the rest of Friday, Saturday and Sunday. My return flight is at 11:30 am local time and will get me home around 2 pm for work next day. 

I’ll be spending about 950 on round trip and around 250ish on accommodation (AirBnB shared with my local friend that’s traveling with me). Time is not an issue but am I spending too much. 

I cannot take any more days off for overseas trips because I spend most of my vacation days visiting my family once an year who also live overseas. Let me know what y’all think about it. 

Edit : To add context, I don’t see getting myself off work for any longer than this since I use most of my PTOs to visit my parents once an year who live like 28 hours away from me. Jet lag should not be an issue since I’ve done a few such tightly packed trips to cities within the US. Other than the next day being slow at work, I seem to cope just fine with it and cherished the experience.

"Paris CDG Airport Termimal 2E doesn’t let you go into another gate (K, L, M) if your flight isn’t departing from that gate?","
I had a 10hr layover and wanted to find a nice sit-down restaurant to have breakfast and knock off 2 hours off my wait. My connecting flight was Terminal 2E - Gate K, but after passing through security there weren’t much food options there (just Starbucks, McDonald’s, Pret etc vs. a proper sit down place). I saw one single restaurant that was in Terminal 2E - Gate L, so I went back past security and hopped on the train to the next stop - but the lady checking boarding passes at the start of the line said technically I couldn’t since my flight departed from gate K She said if it were up to her it would be no problem, so she let me through - but warned that they might not let me at the point of the boarding pass scan (she was right) the guy reiterated the same that I could only go through if my flight was leaving from a gate L. 

Am I wrong to find this pointlessly odd? This is not trying to go to an entirely different terminal, just a different letter code gate. In most airports, after security at your terminal, the signage will point you to gates A to C - left, gates D to F - right, etc. You can simply go to wherever as needed. But seems at CDG, you are locked into not just your terminal, but your gate letter. And you must go through security to simply get to a different gate letter that’s departing from the exact same terminal!

Barcelona was underwhelming,"Visited Barcelona recently for a few days as part of a larger Spain trip. I had very high hopes because of how much praise and hype Barcelona always gets. 

Honestly though…I was a little disappointed and in fact, I would probably place it as my least favourite place out of everywhere I visited in Spain (Madrid, Granada, Sevilla and San Sebastián). 

Some of the architecture is cool but I felt like there’s nothing that it offers that other major European cities don’t do better. It was smelly and kinda dirty, and I felt some weird hostile vibes as a tourist as well. The food was just decent, and none of the attractions really blew me away, other than Sagrada Familia. The public transit and walkability is *fine* but again, nothing amazing.

What to do near Paris de-Gaulle for six hours?,"Editing for clarity--more asking if there's even a possibility of leaving the airport for four to six hours; if there is, does anyone know something near the airport of Paris de-Gaulle?

There obviously won't be much time to do anything but I'd rather not stay in the airport for the full eight hours if at all possible, and it would be cool to see something/do something in the surrounding area.

Scam-ish tactic at CDG/Paris,"If you’re departing from CDG and want to get a paper boarding pass, you can use the self-service kiosks inside the terminal. As I walked up to the machines, I was approached by a woman with a clipboard who offered to help . I thought to myself “*Geez, the French must be upping up their customer service game in preparation for the Olympics*”. She walked me through the steps to print a boarding pass. As I thanked her and was about to leave, she showed me a document on her clipboard to sign, and asked for a donation. She was supposedly working for an NGO helping deaf-mute people, according to the stuff printed on the document. I ended up giving her 10 euros and wrote down that amount, in case she is legit and needs to report her “earnings” to her manager. On looking back, I didn’t need her help at all as I speak French and the kiosk can display several languages.

So unless you want or need the handholding, just ignore folks who approach you. A “non merci - no thanks” should do it.",190,58,1706945739.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ahqow7/scamish_tactic_at_cdgparis/,phil161
Is There Another City That Feels Like Prague?,"I traveled to Europe a long time ago, and I really enjoyed Prague. On the other hand,  I didn't personally connect with Paris. Sorry to Parisians.

How do I take this bucket list trip?,"I have stage 4 cancer.  I'm not dying yet, but the treatment I was on stopped working, and now I am trying other treatments.

Having said all that, my family and I (husband, and 3 kids -9,10,17), may not get a lot more time to travel all the places we wanted to see before I'm gone.

I have never been to Europe, and I've always dreamed of visiting London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome (or Venice or Tuscany), and eating my way through the continent!

I am wondering if there is a way to visit all those places with 5 people in 2-3 weeks.

Train?  River Cruise?  What's the best way to get around?  Is there a way to get help planning this kind of trip?  Places to eat? Basically everything?

We are looking at a budget of $35,000 ($6k per person).

Edit:  to answer a few questions

- I am from the US (Denver, CO).

- The soonest we'd want to go is probably the fall.  My kids get a week off in October.  But if we should try and do next summer, that would give us even more time to plan.

Edit 2:  you guys are so amazing!  You've given me the confidence to know we CAN make this trip, even if the thought of planning it is quite overwhelming!

I'm the kind of person who usually does all inclusive because I don't like to have to figure out every detail!  

I'll likely take the suggestion of many of you to reach out to a travel agent and see what they suggest.  Seems to be the smart move!

Edit:  I got more messages and comments overnight than I have ever gotten before!  Thank you all.  It will take me a while to sift through.  But this is why I love Reddit!  When someone needs help, you all show up!

Edit:  a lot of you have been saying to take the trip sooner.  Unfortunately, I'm currently getting chemo every 3 weeks until the end of April, which means I feel pretty crappy 2 weeks out of the month.

So I can't plan the trip until I know how I'm going to feel when my chemo is done.

I really want to hold out until October so it won't be so hot, and I'll know where I'm at as far as how I'm feeling.

I know it's a risk that I won't be well enough.  If things get to that point, I'll probably cash in my 401k and just go!",1231,247,1739747507.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ir5gno/how_do_i_take_this_bucket_list_trip/,smartypants333

Would Paris or Lisbon be a better fit for my interests?,"I've mostly traveled around Asia and haven't been to many places in Europe, so I'd like to branch out. Previously, my favorite places have been megacities, and Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taipei have been my favorite destinations so far.

Things I enjoy doing include: walking around a city's downtown areas, visiting touristy landmarks, seeing local festivals and events, and, really, just wandering around aimlessly and seeing what I stumble upon.

I'm not a big partier, though and am not very interested in bars, clubs, parties, etc. I also do amateur videography as a hobby, so it'd be nice to not have to be too worried about being pickpocketed or having equipment stolen while I try to film something.

March 2025 - London + Edinburgh + Paris (+ Barcelona?) 16 days. Help me solve a complex problem.,"We are going to London to see a single (special) West End show in early March. We were originally just going to go for a long weekend, but then I thought ""Why not extend the trip to go to Edinburgh?"" since we've both never been.

Then my partner said, ""I'd like to go to Paris too."" And I said ""That's ok with me.""

And then I thought, ""While we're at it, we might as well try to squeeze Barcelona in there too."" Since it's also on our wish list of places to go as well.

So now it turned into a complex problem that I'm trying to figure out lol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luckily, we are decently flexible on the number of days we can travel, probably up to 16 days. So, I'm trying to balance out the itinerary with as many spots as possible, without going overboard and making the trip too hectic. My fundamental question is, what is too much?

We've been to both London and Paris before so we probably don't need to max out the time there.

What's the optimal number of days to spend in each place? Since we've been to London and Paris before, we probably don't need to spend a full itineraries' worth of time in there. It also doesn't seem like you need to spend more than a couple of days in Edinburgh.

So far, the rough itinerary i've come up with is this:

1. Fly in: 1 Day
1. London: 4 days
1. Edinburgh: 3 days
1. Paris: 4 days
1. Barcelona? 3 days?
1. Fly out: 1 day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we do include all the locations, what is the most efficient order to visit these places? Since there are no nonstop flights to or out of Edinburgh from our home, it seems like we'll need to:

1. Fly into London
1. Take the train to Edinburgh
1. Fly from Edinburgh to Paris
1. Fly from Paris to Barcelona
1. Fly from Barcelona back home.




Any advice is appreciated. How should I think about this?",10,38,1734824626.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hjmaj2/march_2025_london_edinburgh_paris_barcelona_16/,aghowl
"Exceptions to the ""don't eat in tourist restaurants"" rule:","The recent post about why not to eat in the tourist zones got me to thinking about a couple notable exceptions to that rule. And if people live in a tourist town (I do and I will include an exception in Hawaii), that could be a fantastic resource.

Example #1 -- Bouillon Chartier, Paris

It's steps from Montparnasse station. That area has loads of tourist-trap restaurants and fast food, including a Burger King.

And if someone visited Paris and ate at Bouillon Chartier for lunch and dinner every single day, I wouldn't blame them. Why? Unironic French classics served inexpensively in an Art Deco dining room that is straight out of a old postcard of the City of Light.

A three-course meal for two, with wine, will set a couple back maybe 50 Euro. And it's an ideal place to bring children to introduce them to French cuisine in an unstuffy, accessible way.

Who's going to be there? Tourists. French tourists visiting Paris and a LOT of Asian tourists.

Example #2 -- Din Tai Fung, Taipei.

This is a tourist destination in itself inside Taipei 101. It's a little overpriced (but honestly, not much). These are popping up in California and Las Vegas. And a meal of soup dumplings will taste great and won't break the bank.

You'd never hear me say ""no"" to a ""let's go to Taipei 101 and get some dumplings."" Not happening.

Example #3 -- Super J's, Captain Cook Hawaii

Since I promised, here's a small place in Hawaii. This is Hawaiian food made by Hawaiians for Hawaiians. (Actually, it's for everyone -- but I almost never see tourists here.) The food is inexpensive and delicious. Ambiance and view aren't all that much. But this is one of a handful of places that isn't heating Sysco food and selling it for fine-dining prices.

If you have any more examples of ""good food done right in the middle of a Tourist Zone,"" please share.",1087,755,1720655987.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e0b0x1/exceptions_to_the_dont_eat_in_tourist_restaurants/,MonkeyKingCoffee

"Nice to Paris: flight, train, or bus?","Hi all would love some advice! 

I have an overseas flight from Paris ORLY to the States at 11:30AM on June 5. I need to get from Nice to Paris, and I’ve looked at trains, flights, and buses, and I’m conflicted about what to do. 

Flight: Easyjet 6:30 —> 8:00 AM. This is what I’m leaning towards because it takes me directly to the same airport. 3.5 hours should be enough time since I’m not checking in any bags. 

Train+bus: there’s a train+bus option that departs at 5pm the previous day and arrives at ORLY at 5:30AM June 5. Since it’s overnight, it can save me one night’s accommodation. However, I’m a little hesitant about changing from train to bus in the middle of the night, and I’m a young solo female traveler too. I also have a long international flight ahead, so I’m not thrilled about having a 24+ hour travel day.

Train: Or should I be extra cautious, get to Paris the previous day at 9PM and book accommodations? I don’t love this option because I’m pretty much wasting a day, and I’ll need to spend more on accommodations. 

So again, I’m leaning towards flying with Easyjet. Does anyone have experience with Easyjet? From my quick search, they do seem pretty reliable, and it’s an early flight. I’m just worried delays might happen. 

I’ve been going in circles the past couple days trying to decide what to do, so I’m finally posting. Any advice or commentary is appreciated! Thanks in advance :) ",1,19,1745174816.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k3tjjx/nice_to_paris_flight_train_or_bus/,icepops77

I was a couple of weeks and visited Buenos Aires, Bariloche, El Calafate, Ushuaia and Iguazú. From best to worst: 

Iguazú: the falls are really astonishing.

Ushuaia: very interesting, unique place

El Calafate (Perito Moreno): definitely worth it but for some reason the glacier wasn't that wow feeling I had in Iguazú

Bariloche: rented a car. Cool place but honestly you can see the same stuff or better in some parts in Europe or North America (Alps, Rocky mountains, etc)

Buenos Aires: ran down hole. I spent three days and there were too many. Unsafe, uber expensive, for a big city there are plenty more interesting in Europe and even North America. 

Now the bad things:

**- Safety:** Argentina is NOT a safe country. Buenos Aires is not a safe city despite how locals will try to convince you. Whoever says ""central Buenos Aires is like New York/Miami/London/Paris"" is in complete denial.

I never left premium areas (Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, Belgrano, Microcentro, etc.) and you could see people (locals!) looking around while using their phones. Or whenever I walked down the street, if I ""overtook"" another person on a walkway, he or she will look back to check that I was not ""safety threat"". Many people with their backpacks on the front.

I took Ubers back and forth to La Boca and the areas around where complete slums. I wouldn't have liked my Uber broke down there. xD

On the other hand for instance Ushuaia felt safe. But Ushuaia is a small town isolated from the world.

**- Prices:** I was not expecting Argentina to be cheap but it is a complete joke now. Prices make no logic. The dollar blue (more convenient) is now roughly 10% more convenient than the official rate. So it was not about me exchanging dollars in the wrong places. 

  
Just an example. The Prison in Ushuaia (a small local museum) was 36.700 ARS in September (maybe the prices have been increased because inflation and the website is not updated)

[https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen](https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen)

That means that in the ""dollar blue"" (the unofficial more favorable exchange), it is 32 USD

[https://cuex.com/en/ars\_pa-usd](https://cuex.com/en/ars_pa-usd)

The Louvre museum (they recently increased prices) is 22 EUR. Or 23 USD

[https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission](https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission)

So a small museum in Ushuaia is more expensive than the Louvre.

The minitrekking in Perito Moreno (walking in the glacier) is now 480,000 ARS + 45,000 ARS for the entrance to the park (compulsory). So a total of 525,000 ARS or (!) 466 USD just for walking in the glacier (with a group) for about 2 hours. It is nice but nothing really glamourous or private. Just a typical group being taken from left to right on big buses then big boat then big group walking the glacier. 

[https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/](https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/)

I have been quite a few times in Switzerland and once in Norway and I never felt that ""ripped off"". At least Switzerland/Norway are top notch, clean, wealthy countries, but no offence Argentina is at best a ""second world"" country. So you are paying those prices in quite a dysfunctional environment.

**- Inconvenience:** 

Argentina is quite a dysfunctional country so expect inconvenience. For instance, flights. I paid a fortune for domestic flights (I flew Aerolíneas and flyBondi) and I had a few big delays. I could see on the screens plenty of cancelled flights. And right now (as of November 10, 2024) there are strikes that leave airports closed. So good luck if you are stranded in Ushuaia which is like 3,000 km to Buenos Aires which itself is like 10,000 km to the US or Europe. 

My advice is that Argentina is not worth the visit right now. 

Prices are completely out of control. The inflation stuff changes all the time, so maybe booking a holiday 3 months from now means that in January (for instance) prices will be 30% more expensive (or cheaper). 

There are a lot of social issues (I remember - I read Spanish -) reading in the newspapers in the street that 52% of Argentinians live below the poverty line. That means strikes, crime, etc. that can affect you directly or indirectly.

Just wait for things to calm and it might be worth to visit. Skip Buenos Aires (just one day max to check it out) and venture into the nature that is worth visiting.

How not to have a bad time in Paris?,"My wife and I have just spent 5 days on the Côte d'Azur and had kind of a mediocre time. It has been touristy, expensive and hard to find genuine food and experiences. We have never had this problem before in any other country, so we're obviously doing something wrong. We're Swedish, fwiw, maybe we have some ultra specific cultural blind spot.

Tomorrow we leave for Paris. We will stay in a hotel in Montmartre for 3 nights. How do we avoid more of this french brand of touristy mediocrity?

We like art, nature, genuine food and good drinks. We don't like partying all night or hanging out with tour groups. We're not averse to spending money on good experiences.

We're specifically looking for recommendations regarding restaurants, bars, museums and scenic walks. Please save our honeymoon!

inb4 paralymics. We're aware it might affect our experience.

  
--- EDIT ---

Some people are asking how Côte d'Azur became Côte d'isastre. This was mainly a lack of planning on our part, and it wasn't terrible, we mainly had a hard time finding good food. We stayed in Juan-Les-Pins (which we would have realized was not the correct place with a little more research), where we had an incredibly tough time discerning the quality of restaurant through e.g. google maps or looking at menus.   
  
It wasn't all bad, the beaches were nice, we ate several delicious pan bagnats, Île Sainte-Marguerite was fantastic and we enjoyed Èze village and dinner at the Château Eza. We then had some bad luck in Nice, where we had booked a hotel with carpet bugs, and had a hard time getting a table. Fwiw, we had a fantastic afternoon and evening in Nice yesterday, and we know that if we had been better prepared we would have had a better time. This is why we made this post, to make sure we guve Paris the chance it deserves. 

Thank you all who commented and suggested things to do. We will be spending our train journey going through it all. ",0,52,1725795708.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fbvtd8/how_not_to_have_a_bad_time_in_paris/,Path_of_math

Is the Seine River cruise in Paris worth it?,"I will be in Paris for 3 days next month. This is the first time that I will be visiting France. I know 3 days is not nearly enough for Paris and I will be barely scratching the surface but I cannot extend the number of days.

I will be walking around the City and doing the usual touristy things such as visiting the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Louvre (I am not a big museum person, but Louvre is a must do for Paris, so it is the only museum that I am planning to go to). 

I was considering the Seine River cruise with dinner on one of the days that I will be there. The idea is to see as many landmarks as possible while also having a nice dinner. For those of you that have done it, is it worth it? Or am I better off just walking around the city by foot and taking it all in?",49,82,1701795037.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18bgdk7/is_the_seine_river_cruise_in_paris_worth_it/,tasunami

Help me nail down my Paris & Haute-Savoie itinerary,"Solo female traveller with a week and a half in early September to fill.     
I fly into Paris on Wednesday 3rd and a flight to Spain out of Lyon on Friday 12th.     

As I’ve been to Paris a few times now, my initial plan was to only stay 2 nights to do some shopping and see a couple of exhibitions.     
Then head somewhere else for a couple of days, and head to Lyon on Monday 8th.     

I’ve played around with the idea of either Strasbourg and the Black Forest for those couple of days, or down to Avignon before coming back to Lyon. However everything I’ve looked at seems like I will waste half of my time on trains or buses and be too rushed.     

My last Europe trip I feel like I spent too much time in cities and not enough out in the countryside. I’d really like to visit Annecy, Chamonix and Mont Blanc, and I feel I probably need a night in Annecy (probably two if I’m honest, 1 day to explore Annecy and 1 for chamonix/mont blanc). 

So now I’m thinking I’ll just stay longer in Paris and head to Lyon earlier, rather than squeeze something in this 2 days. My revised itinerary looks like;     
Wed 3rd - Paris     
Thurs 4th - Paris     
Fri 5th -  Paris.    
Sat 6th - Lyon     
Sun 7th - Lyon     
Mon 8th - Lyon     
Tues 9th - Annecy     
Wed 10th - Annecy, chamonix/mont blanc     
Thurs 11th - return to Lyon     
Fri 12th - fly out.    

Does my itinerary look sound?     
I don’t need all that time in Paris, should I do a day trip somewhere, if so, recommendations? I like seeing natural beauty and love history.     
3 full days just for Lyon feels like too much, should I consider a day trip somewhere?     
Also, any recommendations for a short hike (half day max) around chamonix for an inexperienced hiker (with an otherwise reasonable level of fitness) that will give me some beautiful alpine views?     

Lastly, if you made it this far and have somewhere else I should consider going instead, I am happy to hear your recommendations!",1,6,1750498422.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lgsmae/help_me_nail_down_my_paris_hautesavoie_itinerary/,elsiepoodle

Taking a trip to Paris and don’t know what to expect,"Paris

In mid March my wife and I (Americans) will be traveling to Paris for a week. We plan on taking a day trip to London in the middle via train as well. We always hear about how poorly Americans are treated in France and how in recent years the city has been riddled with theft. I am curious what to actually expect as I am generally not a believer of most media related opinions like that. This is a trip that I’ve wanted to go on for 15 years since taking French for four years in high school and am worried it will end up being a “don’t meet your heroes” sort of thing.

Paris CDG scam?,"Hi everyone!
Second trip to Paris complete, only difference is I used the RER trains to get to and from the city centre, we entered Paris via Orly, that was a smooth experience.
However I am leaving through CDG. After a long day, I ensured I was still paying as much attention as possible for gates and tickets, so I topped up my Navigo card to get to CDG via two metro changes then the RER B train. The navigo card worked the whole time until the final gate at CDG.
Other travelers seemed to have the old style RATP tickets but I 100% did not see any signs or info relating to correct ticketing.
A young man greeted us asking how much i paid for the ticket. Me being the honest person I am I said €7.50. He let us through the gate at first then, The man mentioned that isn't enough for the ticket and they are around €11. He then requested that me and my girlfriend paid a combination of €60. Once I mentioned I had no cash, I noticed a bit of hesitation to help us. There was a French lady next to us in the same situation but he let her walk away. He then directed me to an ATM. I showed them the money, he counted then guided us to the correct gate then left.
I do feel this was more forced upon us, as our French wasn't great and we were confused.
Is this a sort of legal scam? I'm not sure why I couldn't just pay for a ticket there if I didn't have the correct ticket. Also the fact he pocketed the money and just went back to standing in the terminal makes me uneasy. 
Sorry for the long winded story!!!

Train from Paris to Nice - Turnaround in Marseille?,"Myself and a friend are traveling to France this September/October, and we'll be taking the train from Paris to Nice. We're both fairly sensitive to motion sickness, so to the extent that it's possible we're trying to book seats that will face the direction of travel. I've done some research to determine what's likely to be front-facing seats (since it isn't labeled on the booking site) but there's a catch - from what I'm reading, sometimes the train from Paris to Nice stops in Marseille and turns around. If it was for less than an hour or so we could probably handle it, but it's about 2.5 hours of backwards travel, and I'd rather not subject us to that. 

When I'm looking at the SNCF website, some trains from Paris to Nice don't have a stop listed at Marseille. Can I assume that these trains don't have this turnaround point, and if we book a front-facing seat we will stay front-facing the whole way?

"Traveling from Paris to Switzerland for 3 days...last day in Zurich, how do I spend the other 2 days?","Just curious on people's thoughts, heading to London then Paris in August.  Was originally planning to fly from paris to Rome for 3 days but the time frame is when everyone is on holiday and I'd prefer to get a true Italy experience instead of things being closed and locals being gone.

If I take a train from Paris to Switzerland with the plan to spend the last day in Zurich (and then fly back to London) how would you all recommend I spend the first 2 days?  Was really looking to see the beauty of Switzerland with beautiful lakes and scenery for the first two days before ending things in the city for the final day.

I realize this is nowhere near enough time to appreciate Switzerland but this should be thought of more like a wine tasting then a true trip.  If we love it, we'll come back for a longer stay to do it properly.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Oeschinen lake looks breathtaking but seems to be away from everything so maybe that doesn't work due to timing.  Just hoping to make the most of the 2 days.  Since we will have luggage maybe it makes sense to settle someplace for the 2 days and explore out from there before heading into Zurich?

however, this is my main ask: i’d like to make the most of my trip & travel somewhere in between paris and milan for 1-2 nights and 2 days. relatively affordable (so probably not switzerland), accessible by train from paris and to milan (ideally no transfers). also, i am a woman traveling alone so would like to consider that - although i live in nyc so i am well equipped to handle things, however i do not really speak french! i will try to learn a bit, i promise! i am open to anywhere preferably in france or italy, although a smaller town or village is calling out to me most. i’d love somewhere with kind strangers, relaxing & peaceful to read write or draw with a few cafes & restaurants or places to walk around, and a body of water or nature never hurts! feel free to humble me (kindly) if this is not possible. 

some ideas, none immensely well-researched:
* grenoble 
* crema (vibe seems like what i want)

I think I'm done with Airbnb,"I have been a user of Airbnb since 2014.
Despite traveling as a couple, most of the times, we liked to use it to have a ""taste"" of living as a local. 

Hong Kong, Paris, Copenaghen. Great experiences, back when people used to put their own homes/flats up for rent while they were abroad.

During covid we didn't travel and having a baby put a pause on our travelling.

This year we started travelling back in Asia (with our kid) and boy how shitty the whole Airbnb experience has become.

All of our visited places so far (2 in Philippines and 2 in Bangkok) have been so awful.

All places are just sub-rented places, they put a few things in, and they put it up on Airbnb. Dirty as hell, no amenities. Like we are 3 people but you find only 2 forks, 1 mug, 1 glass, etc. One of the places in Bangkok had mold. Another one had mushrooms [Pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/1GVlN1Z.jpg) [Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/6H5YlND.jpg) growing from the kitchen wooden side panel... 

Rules over rules. I understand some travellers are assholes too, but come on.

It seems the Hosts have lost their common sense. 

Just now, I post this after cancelling my airbnb stay in Makati next week (we are 4 people) because of their rules and requests, and preferred to book 2 hotel rooms (which guess what, they came even cheaper than this airbnb place we got).

"First time traveling to Europe- how to efficiently spend 2 weeks (London, Paris…Madrid)?","Hi everyone,

My wife and I got married last year. We were planning to spend the second leg of our honeymoon in Europe, but based on availability, points conversions etc ., it’ll be better to go in September and use this as our belated First Year Wedding Anniversary travel rather than honeymoon.

We are both history buffs that learned French growing up from Grades 1-12 and also love shopping and dining. London and Paris are no brainers for us. I have heard conflicting opinions about traveling around as much as possible vs. honing in on a couple of major cities.

We would definitely start out by flying into London and spend 3-4 days there. From there, we’d go to Paris either by train or flight and spend at least 4 days here. Having an extra day in Paris is very important to my wife. We really only planned on London and Paris, so aren’t sure what would make the most sense to do with the rest of our trip. I was thinking of either going to Spain and spending 3-4 days in Madrid, or splitting that equally between Madrid and Barcelona.

I think this is how we’ll ultimately end up before returning home to South Florida:

London for 4 full days 
Paris for 4 full days
Madrid for 4 full days

Account for 2 days spent in the air.

Would it make sense to get back to London and catch the round trip back to South Florida from Heathrow (on points), or would it be better to just do a one way back from Spain for the sake of time?

Or, are we selling our selves short? With only 14 days, should we hone in on 2 cities only? Or should we add an extra day or 2 to our trip, work and $$$ permitting?

Which capital city gets a lot of hate that you loved visiting? ,"It’s common for people to shit on visiting capital cities. They often get labeled as too touristy, too crowded, unsafe, inauthentic, boring, etc. I don’t understand how people can get bored in a city with millions of people and ton’s of attractions, but everyone’s entitled to their opinion so I respect that. 

So what’s a city you visited that gets constant hate but you ended up loving? I’ll start. This year, I visited Lima Peru, Santiago Chile, and Brussels. These 3 cities constantly get shit on for being bland but I loved each one. Lima has some of the best food you will ever eat, and the nightlife is underrated. Santiago also has solid nightlife even tho it always gets labeled as boring. I also loved how modern Santiago looked and the close proximity to nature. Brussels is probably the city I’ve heard people complain about the most of the 3. But then I get there and it’s a city full of great beer, great chocolate/waffles, and amazing architecture.

VAT refund when shopping in Paris but short layover in Amsterdam before returning to the US,"I’d like to share my experience with the VAT refund process during a layover in Amsterdam in February 2025. This was my first time going through the VAT process at AMS, and also my first time doing one during a layover. Initially, I was super stressed because there was limited information about doing VAT refunds during a layover at AMS. However, now that it’s done, I can say it wasn’t as difficult as I thought—it just requires a little planning. A three-hour layover at AMS gave me more than enough time to complete everything for the VAT refund but I may have been lucky due to the time of day (morning) and the season (off-peak/winter). I hope my experience helps others who find themselves in a similar situation.

Part 1- Shopping and obtaining VAT forms: 
I went shopping in Paris.  For each qualifying purchase, I asked for VAT/detaxe forms and presented my physical passport to the cashier at checkout. I asked for my refund to be sent to my credit card (as opposed to cash- this is just personal preference).  One tip: before you leave the store, check the VAT forms to make sure they typed your information correctly.  I had two store associates misspell my name and one lady put the wrong passport number.  Unfortunately for me, I did not realize the errors until after I left.  At high end boutiques, they ask you to review your information on the VAT forms to ensure it is correct.  But this isn’t the case at all stores. I can’t recommend enough that you check all forms for accuracy before you leave the store. Also, if possible, ask for an envelope because depending on your situation you may need one (more below).  

A note about shopping at Galeries Lafayette Haussmann: For my Louis Vuitton and Jimmy Fairly purchases, the vendors provided me with VAT/detaxe forms directly. However, for clothing purchases in the women’s fashion section, I had to take my receipts to the VAT/detaxe area on the first floor of the main store, across from the Saint Laurent boutique. Here, in the VAT/detaxe area, you scan your receipts, and the kiosk generates the VAT/detaxe forms for you. These are the forms you'll need to take to the airport for stamping.

Part 2- Packing for Return Trip Home:
When doing a VAT refund during a layover (airside aka on the side after security), all the items for which you want to receive a VAT refund must be unused/unworn and must be with you in your carry-on. This is because the customs officers may inspect your purchased items before stamping your forms. In AMS, there was a sign that basically said, “no goods, no stamp”.

Part 3- Getting VAT Forms Stamped at AMS:
Each VAT form from your shopping trip must be stamped in the last EU country you visit before leaving the EU—this includes short layovers, so be sure to plan your flight accordingly when booking! Since I had a layover in Amsterdam before my flight back to the US, my VAT forms had to be stamped at AMS (and not Paris CDG where I did the shopping).   

On the day of my departure from Europe, I flew from Paris CDG to Amsterdam AMS, where I had a three-hour layover. Upon landing at AMS, I went through passport control, which had two lines: one on the left for certain passport holders, such as US citizens, and a much longer line on the right for everyone else. I joined the US passport line and went through an automated lane, where I scanned my passport and had my photo taken. After passing through the automated lane, I handed my passport to an officer, who stamped it. The entire passport control process took only about five minutes for me.

Once out of this passport control area, I found myself in the Lounge 2 area of the airport (in America we might call it Terminal instead of Lounge).  I had to walk about 15 minutes to get to Lounge 3.  I was able to get there without passing through security- it’s all open and connected but requires a bit of walking. I mention this only because on my way to Paris, I also had a layover at AMS but had to go through security between Lounges and it took over an hour.  Anyways, once in the Lounge 3 area of the airport, look for Tony’s Chocolate or Victoria’s Secret.  On the opposite side of these stores, you will see a shop called, “The Fashion Gallery.” To the left of this shop is a gray sign that says “Tax free validation/refund.  Step 1: get a stamp.” When I arrived around 10AM, no one was in line.  I walked right up to the window and the customs officer asked, “DO YOU HAVE YOUR GOODS???” I replied “yes” and he asked me for my VAT forms.  He stamped all the forms without inspecting my “goods” or saying another word. I then took pictures of all stamped VAT forms for my record.

Part 4- Submitting Your Stamped VAT Forms:
The next step differs based on your VAT operator. On each VAT form, check the top right-hand side under “Identification” to verify the “Operateur de Detaxe”.  This is the company that will handle your refund (i.e. Global Blue or SolPay). This might be obvious to some but it was confusing for me: The operator (i.e. Global Blue or SolPay) can be a 3rd party company and can be different from the store where you bought your items (i.e. Louis Vuitton).  Alternatively, the operator could be the same company as where your purchased your items (i.e. Galeries Lafayette Haussmann). 

If your VAT operator is Global Blue: Literally right next door to where you got your custom stamp, mere feet away, is the Global Blue window. The person at the Global Blue window took my stamped Global Blue VAT forms.  He suggested I download the Global Blue app to track my progress/status. If this window is closed (i.e. you’re transiting through AMS outside of their business hours), there is a Global Blue mailbox near the window.  You can put your stamped forms in the envelope and stick it into the Global Blue mailbox. This is when the envelope comes in handy so ask for an envelope at the store.

If your VAT operator is Galeries Lafayette Haussmann: Someone said the bookstores in AMS will mail my postage-free envelope containing my stamped VAT form.  But I went to two bookstores in the airport and both of them told me they only mail out postcards, nothing else. I didn’t know what else to do so I brought my stamped VAT forms home to the US and mailed them from the US using the correct postage for mailing a letter to France.

If your VAT operator is SolPay: There are no mailboxes for SolPay at AMS. Once I got home to the US, I mailed my stamped VAT form to them using my own envelope with the correct postage for mailing a letter to France. 

If your VAT operator is someone else not listed above: in the vicinity of the customs stamp line and Global Blue window, there were two other silver mailboxes. I forget which companies but if your VAT operator is one of those companies you can drop off your stamped VAT forms in the corresponding mailboxes. Otherwise, you’ll probably have to do what I did, which is to bring your stamped VAT forms home and mail them from your home country.

Part 5: Wait for Refund
Voila! Now, it’s a waiting game for my refund back to my credit card


Update- it’s been 2.5 weeks since forms submitted/mailed: 
GlobalBlue refund: It took 2 weeks for the app to update the status from “custom stamp needed” to “tax free form received.” And then a few days later I received my refunds back to my credit card. 

Galeries Lafayette refund: It took 1.5 weeks for the status online to show customs validation received (meaning they received the stamped form I mailed from the US, yay!).  It now shows that my refund is processing and the website says it takes 3-5 weeks from the date of receiving forms for refund. Still waiting on refund. 

SolPay: We’re two weeks out and the website says “TAX-FREE FORM VALIDATED Our company refund delay policy is 4 weeks after customs validation. We will proceed to your tax refund very soon.” I’m assuming this means they received the stamped form that I mailed from the US.  My only concern with this refund is that the sales associate typed the wrong name AND wrong passport number so I’m not certain I’ll get this refund. Still waiting on refund.

My experience with Paris,"
I’m on the plane flying back home. What an amazing experience I had! All the shopkeepers and waiters were nice and patient with our horrible French. The food were great. The museum was awesome. The architecture and scenery were breathtaking. People were genuinely happy when I attempted to speak French. The streets were mostly safe*. We stayed west of the Eiffiel tower and walked around the Lourve area. We also visited the arc and Monmartre. 

* My only negative experience was some man walked up to me and reached out his hand trying to touch my fur jacket. I ran and he shouted some stuff to me in French. Then another guy just chatted with me in a mix of French and English and offered me weed me while I was sitting at the bench to take a break from walking. All this happened on pont des arts and Rue de Rivoli. 

This experience made me feel a little disturbed, but it’s nothing compared to what I’ve read and heard like people getting robbed and grabbed and things like that.

Sahara or Paris in mid June? Need Advice,"
Hi! I’m planning a trip to Spain and Portugal from June to early July, and I’m considering making a stop in Morocco in the middle of my trip. I’m torn between doing a Sahara Desert tour in Merzouga or heading to Paris instead.

To be honest, I’m more interested in visiting the Sahara — it’s been on my travel bucket list for a long time. But I’ve heard that it can get extremely hot in the summer, with intense sun and high UV levels. Of course, it’ll be hot everywhere in June, even Paris, but I’m wondering if the desert heat is just something to be prepared for, or if it’s so intense that it would make the trip really uncomfortable.

If it sounds like the weather would be too difficult to handle, I’m thinking of skipping Morocco this time and saving it for a future trip.

My criteria was not too far from where I was, accessible by public transport, and easy to get home from. Barcelona fit the bill, tickets were fairly cheap so I went. 

I'd heard people raving about how beautiful the architecture and the history is but to be honest, I don't care much about architecture and history. Most of my trips are to remote, isolated places with beautiful natural scenery. I just wanted a place to lay on the beach and relax. I've been to Paris and absolutely hated it. It was cramped, smelly and full of tourists (yes, I recognise the irony) 

It's a amazing city. Most places are easy walking distance from the city centre. The beach is really clean and well maintained. The government has staff to pick up litter from the beach and the sea, and the facilities are surprisingly decent (for public toilets). 

I went to check out some of the tourist sites when it was too hot to lay on the beach and I was impressed at how many of them are in such close proximity, and are free to view or a small donation. 

Overall, things were pretty easy and there was a laid back atmosphere. It's clearly a tourist destination but it didn't feel like a rip off tourist trap like some places 

If you were on the fence about Barcelona, give it a shot. I'd stay longer if I could",2005,441,1690208089.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/158bwqm/i_thought_barcelona_was_overrated_until_i_went/,tomgrouch

Traveling in France — Bordeaux to Paris. Should I rent a car?,"I’ll be traveling to France next month and staying in Bordeaux for one month with my sister and Paris for two by myself. I’m a heavy packer so the two checked luggages and one carry on I plan on taking from the airport to the first airbnb in Bordeaux won’t be too difficult but the three suitcases from Bordeaux to Paris by myself might be. I’m thinking the best option may just be renting a car and driving directly to my Paris airbnb from Bordeaux. Yes, it might be about 150 euros more but I think I’ll be more secure and possibly less stressed than navigating French train stations with so much baggage. 

I can also ask my sister to accompany me on the drive and she can take the train back. 

What do you think? Am I better off taking the train? Has anyone ever dealt with French rental car agencies or driving this route before?

For reference, I’ve driven up to 8 hours in distances by myself. I’m originally from southern California too, so I’ve mastered chaotic highways. ",0,22,1735543927.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hphz3v/traveling_in_france_bordeaux_to_paris_should_i/,fiava

What place have you visited that completely shattered your expectations?,"For me, it was Gdansk, Poland. I only went there as a layover for a few days before going to Paris as it was cheaper than flying direct. Ended up loving it.

Affordable, great public transport, history, museums, old town, food, day trips.

Also had the pleasure of my flight to Paris being overbooked and staying for an extra 2 days. Did mean that I only got a day in Paris, but I found Paris to be so underwhelming (dirty, expensive, falling apart, many scammers, bad weather (not exactly their fault)).

Also honourable mention to Mostar in Bosnia & Herzegovina. Was only there for a day trip from Dubrovnik but that place is gorgeous and had very friendly people.

Hijabis beware of travelling on Air France via Paris,"I was transiting through Paris via Air France and as I was boarding the plane, the woman checking my passport rudely asked me to TAKE MY HIJAB OFF. I thought it was strange as I didn't have any problems through security and have never had any problems anywhere else in the world for the matter. I told her that I would take it off in private but not infront of everyone at the gate. She proceeded to say it again and again getting louder and louder becoming more and more aggressive, on some sort of power trip. I continued to say no I won't take it off infront of everyone but I'll do it privately. My husband tried to step in to say it's religious clothing to which she proceeded to say 'there is no religion in customs' and threatened that I will miss my flight. 

A man who appeared to be a manager (who was brown might I add) stepped in and said that there is no problem. She then turned to me and said, 'I need to see your ears' and after me showing her my ears, she hesitantly let me through.

I was so shocked by this experience, I know France is anti hijab and anti Muslim but the staff honestly need better cultural/religious awareness training. Needless to say I won't be traveling with them again or via Paris. 

Edit: to the comments below, that's fine if it's happened in other parts of the world in your experience, I've travelled extensively and it's never happened I'm just giving my experience and warning others.

Our one day in Paris-a perfect travel day!,"This happened several years ago. My husband and I decided to spend our last day in Paris exploring the city on foot, wherever the sidewalk led us. After a day of people watching and window shopping, we were at our metro entrance, heading back to our hotel. A van pulled up and several people climbed out of the van and were setting up camera equipment-lights, reflectors, lots of stuff and bustling about. We stood aside and watched as a very beautiful, very tall young lady stepped out. She was dressed head to tow in a white outfit, very elegant. They were doing a fashion shoot! I started snapping pictures like crazy as they worked, posing her in front of the metro steps. Finally they started loading up their equipment and one of the people gestured to us. In broken English, we were asked if we wanted a picture with the model! We now have a picture of us standing with that lovely woman who looks just a wee bit embarrassed but smiling anyway, and I've always considered that one of the most perfect days we've ever spent while traveling. And no, the Parisians were never even a bit rude to us.",32,5,1743822469.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jrtyz4/our_one_day_in_parisa_perfect_travel_day/,Dry-Use-272

Our original thought was to spend a few nights in Champagne or Bordeaux and then a few nights in Paris. Before we get too far into booking hotels & things, wanted to see if anyone could offer us some advice...

(i) do you recommend staying in one of the smaller wine towns the first few nights & spending NYE there to avoid crazy crowds in paris?

(ii) any NYE recommendations? i know we dont want to be out in the massive crowds watching fireworks show, but had heard of doing a boat cruise or something more low key / out of the way? would champagne / bordeaux be a fun option instead or super quiet?

(iii) regardless of where we do NYE, any recs on other smaller wine towns? we really are just stepping into french wine & typically drink italian / argentinian, so not exactly sure where we want to be!

any advice would be really appreciated!! thank you!",3,5,1745945555.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kasssj/paris_dec_30_jan_5/,Weak_Bee_7416
How much I spent traveling to 43 Countries in 571 Days,"My girlfriend and I are from the USA and have traveled for **571 days**. Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! My hope in sharing this info is to show that you can travel to some amazing places on a budget! 

The two of us worked for a few years after graduating from university and saved as much money as we could. We paid for everything ourselves (except the 10 days of accommodation my girlfriend's parents paid for). 

This is just one person's spend and we split everything we can (accommodation, taxi, groceries, etc). I'd love to answer any questions about the budget or destinations. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or DM me.

All numbers are in USD$.

**IN TOTAL I SPENT $24,866.42 or $43.55 per day. $6.05 over my planned budget of $37.50 per day.** 

THIS INCLUDES ACCOMMODATION AND FLIGHTS!!!

Some details about the categories:

Accommodation - In Europe: Airbnb/Booking.com is our primary accommodation provider, but we stay in hostels \~30% of the time. 

In Asia: we did not use Airbnb, primarily Agoda/Booking.com/Couchsurfing/Hostels/Guesthouses

Activities - This can be museums, renting motorbikes, group tours, etc.

Coffee - This is just coffee from cafes. 90% of the time I drink coffee at the accommodation.

Food - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.

Health - Travel Health Insurance, Dentist/Doctor Visits, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc - This includes paying for bathrooms (ugh), Fees/Citations, and anything that doesn't fit in the other categories.

Mobile Phone - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States. These are just SIM Cards. I do not buy a SIM card in each country. Moldova had the cheapest SIM at $1.19 for 100 GB of data.

Souvenir - I try to buy a magnet in each country (I have forgotten to buy it for 5 of the nations)

Transportation(local) - Taxis/Uber/Local Bus/Trams/Marshrutkas, etc.

Travel - Anything that takes us from one city or country to another. Ex. Bus from Slovakia to Croatia, Flight from Rhodes to Cyprus. 

Our round-trip flights from the USA to Europe and the USA to Asia were paid with airline miles :)

"First Solo Trip to Europe in 2nd week of December – Spain, Italy, Paris, or Somewhere Else?","F 25. I’m planning a solo trip to Europe next week, possibly the week of December 7, for 4–8 days. It’s my first time traveling alone and my first time visiting Europe. I’m considering Spain (Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, etc.), Italy (Milan, Venice, etc.), Paris, or any other recommendation?

For this trip, I’m looking for a place with milder weather (around 4°C or warmer), minimal rain, and safe for solo travellers, and a huge plus if it has great Christmas markets, but not a priority. Since it’s winter, I’m not planning to spend much time at beaches or swimming and not planning to do winter activities or hiking. I’m interested with the landmarks, arts, culture, architecture, shopping ( huge plus if there’s lots of sales on fashion), sightseeing, foods, and events happening at that time.

My budget is €2k–2.5k, excluding the plane ticket. I plan to stay in Airbnbs or hostels (if it has private bathrooms). I don’t drive, so I’ll rely on public transit or affordable Uber options to get around. I’d prefer a destination that I can fully explore within this trip, but if one week isn’t enough, I’m open to returning in warmer weather.

In the future, I hope to visit all these other destinations with family or friends to have fun together, share meals, hotel costs, and have take photos of me. For this solo trip, I’d still love to capture memories, so I’m thinking about asking tourists for help or using a tripod for photos.

While I plan to eventually visit all these places, I’m looking for the best spot to explore solo for the second week of December. Do you recommend Spain, Italy, Paris, or somewhere else? How many days should I spend there?

I found Paris overrated. Did I simply not understand how to appreciate it?,"I went to Paris a few years ago for 4 days.

My highlights in Paris were the Eiffel Tower, Louvre's exterior, the Seine River, and the Invalides Museum. I like history and beautiful scenery, so the Seine River's sight, the Invalides Museum as well as Napoleon's supposed sarcophagus were very enjoyable for me.

As I was on a tight budget, I have only dined out once in Paris and ate at convenience stores or supermarkets otherwise. The one meal I had at restaurant wasn't bad, but not particularly remarkable either.

I especially disliked the Parisian traffic, which probably doesn't need further explanation.

I didn't really enjoy Louvre's interior because I was indifferent about classical art, but I felt I had to complete it because I didn't want to miss out. Big rookie traveler mistake.

I didn't enter the Sainte Chapelle because it costed money, although I did enter the Notre Dame Cathedral shortly (actually, just a few days) before the fire that burned it.

I went to Versailles, but found it to be a bit boring after the first 2 hours. I feel it's the same thing with Louvre - I forced myself to complete it because I didn't want to feel I missed out, although I've already seen the parts that actually interested me.

Overall, I liked the highs of Paris, and the lows don't really balance the highs out, but I simply was not moved by Paris the way people say it would.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't like the traffic because I walked everywhere and Parisian drivers had no care for the pedestrians. It was difficult to cross the roads.",3,90,1686561962.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/147joke/i_found_paris_overrated_did_i_simply_not/,anbeegod

I’m currently in Europe (solo) and I’m not doing well.,"**EDIT: wow, I’m surprised by how much attention this post got. Thank you so much. I’ll read all the comments.**

**After some reflection, I’ve cancelled the tourist attractions for the next few days. Instead I’ll do some shopping (my fav. past time) and take advantage of the spa services offered at my hotel.**

**I think grief is hitting me hard at this time. My father and I had a complicated relationship so it’s been hard. I’ll use this space to process my feelings before I return home next week.**

**Thank you so much.**


I spent 6 days in Paris and loved it. Now I’m in Barcelona. It’s my third day here and I haven’t visited any tourist attractions just yet. 

But for some reason I am extremely overstimulated. Sounds, noises, crowds, etc. I’m a huge introvert so that could be why. I ensure that I get plenty of sleep each night and yet when I go out, I feel like I’m going to have a meltdown. Yesterday I was having dinner by myself and had to leave early because of the sensory overload. I don’t know why I’m feeling this way because I’ve never felt this way before. My father also passed away 2 years ago and it seems like this trip is making the grief worse. 

Sorry this sounds so heavy. Is anyone in the same boat? I’d hate to waste the remaining time. I’m still in Spain and have 4 more days to go.",1571,569,1690343282.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/159umcb/im_currently_in_europe_solo_and_im_not_doing_well/,Gracilis67
