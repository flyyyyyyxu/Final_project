"I went to Venice with low expectations, but I was proven wrong. Venice is a truly unique place","Hello everyone. My dad and I went to Slovenia for a few days over Christmas last year, and he insisted on visiting Trieste and Venecia while there. At first I wasn’t very inspired, I’d already been to Venice with my class in high school and didn’t love it. But this time was a completely different experience, I saw a different side of the city and we both greatly enjoyed it.

Here’s a bit of a trip report.

# DAY 1: ARRIVAL

After empty Slovenia, it was amusing to arrive to Venice and see swarms of tourists around the train station. We braced ourselves for a couple of days of crowds, but it was actually quite easy to leave everyone behind simply by stepping off the main street. I don’t know what most people do in Venice because most of the streets and even many of the sites we visited were fairly quiet.

We stayed at the **Hotel Tre Archi**, a fansy-pantsy hotel with the old-fashioned almost kitsch wallpaper common in hotels across Venice, with matching bright red bedcovers. It was delightful, highly recommended.

The first day we only walked around near the hotel, just getting a feel for the place.

# DAY 2: CHURCHES & VIVALDI

Day 2 in Venice was a “do everything” day for me. We have different interests so my dad got himself a day pass and went off to ride boats, while I woke up late then went off to see some historical and cultural sites.

\- My first stop was **Banksy’s Migrant Child**. It’s a bit hard to see from the bridge, the angle is a bit crooked, but I did see some boats went right up to it so there must be some sort of tour for it. It was my first time seeing a Banksy and was a little surprised by how… small and normal it looked. A lot of the photos of Banksy’s works are high quality photos, with good lighting and angles and what-not, so that's what I was used to. But the real deal was looking a bit worse for wear, and frankly not unlike any usual graffiti one might find walking around Europe’s city streets. And I think it’s curious to have a Banksy in Venice. The art critics, culture ministry and all the other high culture folk who thrive with Italy’s cultural heritage are all twisting and turning over the controversy of whether to preserve Banksy’s art or let it decay with each splash of water from passing boats: to treat it like high art (due to the fame and cultural importance Banksy has garnered as an artist) or street art (respecting the grounds and ideology on which the art was intentionally created). It’s interesting how it is one of the newest pieces of art in Venice, out of all the art there is in such a place, that is the one to be causing people to question the very concept and intention of art and how we are “supposed” to act and interact with it.

\- The next stop was **Chiesa Parrocchiale di San Pantalon**. This was maybe my favourite church in Venice, the ceiling was an instant jaw-dropper, painted by Fumiani in the late 1600s. Fumiani is the one who introduced the trompe-l'œil technique in Venice and his work embodies it perfectly. I will say that it’s become harder and harder for me as I get older and more travelled to be excited about visiting sites. Thus, to sit down and feel the awe, become giddy with it, is something wondrous that I miss—but encountered once again in San Pantalon.

Right outside San Pantalon was a boat selling veggies. I didn’t need to buy any, but it was a cute sight. I wish there were more market boats!

\- After, I visited the **Ponte dei pugni** and the **Leonardo da Vinci Museum**. This is a small museum recreating Leonardo’s machines and inventions, located inside San Barnaba Church. The entry here is quite steep (9€) for what is essentially a small museum. I thought it was good enough seeing as I speak Spanish, so I was able to understand the video in Italian which took up most of my visit. I would recommend this for those who are crazy about Leonardo, who are rich and don’t care for the entry fee, or those who have kids (some of the displays are interactive), but otherwise one might prefer to leave the Leonardo sightseeing for Florencia.

\- Next up, the **Monumento a Antonio Vivaldi** (it’s a statue, so what you would expect), and then I tried to go to San Nicolò but it was closed until maybe 3pm. It was around 2pm so I decided to go for lunch in that area while I waited. The couple vegan places at the university were closed since it was the day after Christmas, but I enjoyed a very nice lunch at **Carovansara Ristorante Bar**. I ate too quickly, then I had to sit around with my feet dangling off into a canal until the church opened.

\- When I walked into **Chiesa di San Nicolò dei Mendicoli**, what struck me was how dark the place was. While other churches have some light streaming in through high windows, this one didn't have much natural light, and only a handful of dim lanterns allowed me to see. The colours inside were all black and brown and gold, with a baroque feel to it. How they manage such opulence and grandiosity in such a small and quiet space is beyond me. The churches in Venice look completely unassuming from outside, and you step into another world as you push open the heavy doors.

\- After, I walked along the waterside, down the **incurabili street**, until the **Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute**. It’s at this point I must explain that I visited Venice with my class in high school. We were given some free time to walk around and I set my sights on the basilica across the water. My friends and I spent forever trying to reach it, getting hopelessly lost through small streets. No matter where we went, which path we took, the basilica seemed to never get closer. It was taunting us, a siren’s call that wished us to give up all decency and just jump in the grand canal, get some sort of infection from the water by attempting to swim across. We didn't do that. Instead, we eventually gave up and backtracked to the meeting point. But the illusion of a church that never moved yet remained unreachable tickled my mind for the rest of the trip and many times as I thought of Italy over the years. This basilica was thus my Venice revenge. It was a lot easier to reach with a map in hand this time. Inside was a human-size *pessebre*, statues and stuff and some Vivaldi music. It was fairly normal as far as basilicas go, but was extremely satisfying to finally get there.

Getting off this side of the canal, on the other hand, was harder. This area was very crowded so it took forever walking behind slow people until I finally got to the **Ponte dell'Accademia**. Turns out this is a wonderful spot for early sunset views and I was there at just the right moment.

\- Eventually I made it to the **Museo della Musica di Venezia**, I wanted to get in the mood before the Vivaldi concert. Entry was 1-2€ or something. I wish I knew more about instruments to enjoy it more. As it is, I know nothing about anything, so it was more like a display of various instruments, some pretty cool, but not much else. I have many opinions on how to design music museums as an auditory-first experience (I always say I should’ve been a museum designer) so I have many ideas on what could be made out of it with a larger budget. That is, however, a conversation for another time.

After that I just walked around, I passed by the teatro and through the Piazza San Marco for some pics, to San Giovanni in Bragora where Vivaldi was baptised, and finally…

\- **The Church of the Pietà**. This was an orphanage and music school for girls back in the day, and Vivaldi used to work here. A lot of his music was composed for girls at this school and played here for the first time. There was no question, then, to book a Vivaldi concert at this spot. I was there early-ish so got third row, and my dad soon arrived too. We had a wonderful time listening to Four Seasons. I began listening to Vivaldi after watching *L'amica geniale* series (La amiga estupenda / My Brilliant Friend), and has since become my favourite classical composer. I may have generic tastes, I'm sorry, but it's such satisfying music.

After, we took a boat all the way back to the hotel.

# DAY 3: ART & JEWISH GHETTO

Another late morning and I convinced my dad to come with me today. We were going to visit Burano and Murano but didn't feel like it. The only other thing left on my list was Tintoretto, so we headed there instead.

\- We started at **Tintoretto’s house**, Fondamenta dei Mori. In this area, back in the XII century, lived three Greek brothers from Morea, hence the name. There are statues of them and their servant which are a bit wonky from seemingly holding up the weight of the buildings. One of them has a metal nose, we were told it offers good luck if you touch it. They were very rich and owned many of the buildings in this neighbourhood, including what would later be the house where Tintoretto lived. You can't go inside, unfortunately (it would make a great museum!) but it's quite a nice house from outside too.

\- While there, we also stopped by the **Chiesa della Madonna dell'Orto**, Tintoretto’s church and burial site which holds several of his paintings. Seeing the \*Presentazione della Vergine al Tempio\* is really something. We often name da Vinci when talking about the androgynous ideal in art of the XVI century, but Tintoretto did a great job of this which is especially noticeable in this work. There was a man playing the organ during our visit, who stopped mid-piece to have a friendly yelled conversation with a friend down below through the echoing church.

Today's lunch was just a calzoni. I had a very hard time finding vegan food in Italy. Possibly the hardest European country for me so far (bar Macedonia).

\- We walked around more streets, seeing **Marco Polo's house**, we visited a famous shopping centre with the rooftop views but you have to reserve in advance or something these days (not worth it), had a drink next to a canal and finally the **Museo di Palazzo Grimani**. I'm stingy so didn't want to pay for any of the museums, except the Leonardo one everything for me had been cheap or free. But my dad said he'd pay, and honestly it's quite worth going into some of the palazzos or art museums in Venice, they're fantastic. Palazzo Grimani has lots of statues, like Laocoonte and sons being bitten by snakes, and some exhibitions on medicine and nature. You go for the building, not just the exhibition though. My dad was bored but I liked it.

\- Finally, we also visited the **Jewish neighbourhood**. We bought the combination ticket, which did give us entry to two small synagogues and a tiny garden, but it was an expensive fee for what it offered. You really need to download the audioguide they have there onto your phone (we couldn't since we had no data), otherwise there's not much to see or do. But the area as a whole is interesting to walk around.

And that concludes our 2.5 days in Venice! Overall, Venice was much better than I expected it to be. The streets are beautiful, the ambience, the art, architecture... I wouldn't have minded an extra day or two!",5509,222,1748178745.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kv27pn,NotACaterpillar

Looking for another city as walkable as Venice. Any suggestions?,"I’ve been to a lot of European cities, and while most are technically “walkable,” that doesn’t mean they’re actually enjoyable to walk in. To be a really enjoyable for walking, a city has to ban cars and other wheeled objects from whizzing past you. 

Venice is the gold standard for me because it is the most walkable city i’ve ever been to, hands down—because cars literally don’t exist there. The whole city is built around canals, so you either walk or take a boat. No cars whizzing past you to dodge. 

I have already been to Brussels, Bruges, Ghent, Amersterdam, Florence, Rome, Positano, Dublin, Milan, Santorini, Mykonos, Lucca, Pisa, Cinque Terre, London and more. All have lovely parts that are walkable. But I am looking for places that have banned cars, much like Brussels did recently. They made a great walkable historic downtown area that is very lively.

Unpopular travel opinion - resorts are boring,"It’s funny shows like White Lotus and also all the all-inclusives costing so much show the popularity of resorts, but I don’t really get it.

Just sitting around? The only appeal I get is not having to cook or think about food. 

I guess I tend to like hiking or museums or architecture or visiting landmarks like old monasteries or castles. 

I can go sit at the beach (albeit it would be a beach in South Boston) and eat a lobster roll for like $30 so why would I fly to Cabo to do that?

I was nervous the city would be hot, crowded, and overhyped, but we had a truly lovely time. It was crowded but not crazily so -tourist season wasn’t quite in full swing yet-, plus the weather was pretty perfect at around 75 degrees with minimal humidity. We thought the maze-like streets were so charming, we ate great food, and we had fun doing a skip-the-line tour of the basilica and the Doge’s palace. We also took the waterbus to Murano and back, which was fun! My only caveat is that I will say that the water taxis, while very luxurious feeling and fun, were as expensive as everyone says! A taxi ride for 3 people with luggage from the airport to Piazza San Marco was $140 (it’s about a 20-25 min ride).",1010,30,1687756933.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14j83an,libricano

Lisbon or Venice for Europe Trip,"Hello,

I will be going to Europe in August for the first time in my life, and will visit the UK and Southern Spain. However, I recently removed Paris from my plan due to the Olympics happening there, and am thinking to visit another city for 4 days where I will be departing from London.

Right now, I have spend hours trying to decide between Lisbon and Venice, and I still cannot decide.

On one hand, since its my first time going to Europe, I would love to visit a unique city like Venice. Also, I feel like going to Venice will make the trip a bit diverse as Venice will be completely different from the UK and Spain. However, I think I might visit Italy in the future, but it really depends on if I will ever get the time to do so.

On the other hand, Ive heard a lot of good things about Lisbon and I could get the opportunity to see most of the Iberian peninsula. Also, from watching videos of Lisbon, it sort of has a similar vibe to San Francisco with the hills and cable cars, and I loved San Francisco when I went there.

BTW, the flight cost for Venice is cheaper by 60 dollars. Also, I do understand that Venice is more expensive than Lisbon which I am totally fine with. Also, if I go to Lisbon, I would have to fly from London to Lisbon, and then fly to Barcelona since I have already booked the train tickets for Spain. 

  
I totally forgot to mention, but I do enjoy learning about history and visiting historical sites; and I understand that both cities have a rich history. 

Honestly, any advice will be much appreciated it. Im just totally lost right now.",17,82,1716803830.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d1o0rh/lisbon_or_venice_for_europe_trip/,TransferEng2020
How do I take this bucket list trip?,"I have stage 4 cancer.  I'm not dying yet, but the treatment I was on stopped working, and now I am trying other treatments.

Having said all that, my family and I (husband, and 3 kids -9,10,17), may not get a lot more time to travel all the places we wanted to see before I'm gone.

I have never been to Europe, and I've always dreamed of visiting London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome (or Venice or Tuscany), and eating my way through the continent!

I am wondering if there is a way to visit all those places with 5 people in 2-3 weeks.

Train?  River Cruise?  What's the best way to get around?  Is there a way to get help planning this kind of trip?  Places to eat? Basically everything?

We are looking at a budget of $35,000 ($6k per person).

Edit:  to answer a few questions

- I am from the US (Denver, CO).

- The soonest we'd want to go is probably the fall.  My kids get a week off in October.  But if we should try and do next summer, that would give us even more time to plan.

Edit 2:  you guys are so amazing!  You've given me the confidence to know we CAN make this trip, even if the thought of planning it is quite overwhelming!

I'm the kind of person who usually does all inclusive because I don't like to have to figure out every detail!  

I'll likely take the suggestion of many of you to reach out to a travel agent and see what they suggest.  Seems to be the smart move!

Edit:  I got more messages and comments overnight than I have ever gotten before!  Thank you all.  It will take me a while to sift through.  But this is why I love Reddit!  When someone needs help, you all show up!

Edit:  a lot of you have been saying to take the trip sooner.  Unfortunately, I'm currently getting chemo every 3 weeks until the end of April, which means I feel pretty crappy 2 weeks out of the month.

So I can't plan the trip until I know how I'm going to feel when my chemo is done.

I really want to hold out until October so it won't be so hot, and I'll know where I'm at as far as how I'm feeling.

I know it's a risk that I won't be well enough.  If things get to that point, I'll probably cash in my 401k and just go!",1234,247,1739747507.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ir5gno/how_do_i_take_this_bucket_list_trip/,smartypants333

How racist is Italy and Greece?,"I am on a trip in Europe. I am an Indian guy with brown skin. 

So far I have travelled to Austria, North Italy(Dolomites), and Switzerland in my current trip. I'm not sure if I should be labelling this as 'racism' but I feel like the staff of places I've stayed so far in Austria have treated me a bit differently. I noticed the receptionists smiled while talking with white people but were quite cold when talking with me. Initially I thought maybe it's just something to do with me (and not my skin colour), but I saw an Indian couple in the same hotel who were treated same as me in Innsbruck. 
I didn't have any issues in the Dolomites except for few other tourists staring at me (probably because i was the only brown man in most places and not because they are racist). 

I am now heading towards Rome and then Athens and a few Greek islands. 

I enjoy conversing with local people. It is part of the experience for me. 

It would be good to know what to expect in Rome and Greece so that I prepare myself mentally and also maybe keep the conversations short and to the point if people had negative experiences in the past.

My mom is 60. Where are the 10 places I should take her before she turns 70? Money isn't a restriction,"I'm 28F and my mom just turned 60. She recently sent me a picture of her hanging out with her friend and looking at her in the picture made me realize she's getting older and heading towards the end of her life. I also don't live in the same state as her, so I only get to see her in person once or twice a year. She's based in California.

Every year for the next 10 years until she is 70, I want to take her somewhere, just me and her, while she can still walk easily.

What she likes:

* Beautiful scenery of nature
* Guided tours where there's someone else driving us and explaining things
* Places with good authentic food
* Unique places that look/feel visibly different from America but are still safe and (relatively) clean. (imo one good example of this is Venice)

She doesn't particularly enjoy long flights (neither do I), but I know she'd be happy to do it if the place is worth it. I'm not much of a traveler to be honest (though I wish I was!), I have a hard time knowing how to enjoy traveling, but I want to and am committed to doing this.

Here are some ideas I have so far of where to go:

* New Zealand
* The Amalfi Coast + Venice
* Iceland
* Lake Como

I'd love any suggestions or advice. Thank you!

We're both creative and design professionals and intend to visit the Biennale and possibly an orchestra.

Does anyone have café, dining and bar recommendations that aren't overpriced tourist traps? I speak OK Italian if that helps.

 Would 5 days be enough time to spend there? I've got a few hotels in mind but does anyone have particular neighbourhoods they'd recommend staying in?

Also would that month be too warm for a blazer, at least during the day? I'll also pack a linen sports jacket for midday.

"Venice or Florence, Italy?","Hi!

My husband and I traveling to Italy this September and will have 2 days to spend in either Venice or Florence. We are already spending the rest of our trip in Rome and the Amalfi Coast and would like to fit a 3rd city in. We are debating between Venice and Florence. Here are our pros and cons. Would love your advice and recommendation on which city to pick. Thank you!

More about our interests: We don't care to visit museums, which I know Florence has a lot of, so that doesn't appeal to us at all. We love food, architecture, sightseeing, and beautiful scenery.

**Venice**

Note: If we go to Venice, it will be from Sept. 19-21, after the Venice Film Festival so hopefully it's less crowded during this time.

Pros:

* Beautiful, romantic city where the city itself is the art
* Smaller city so we can see more in 2 days and won't feel like we're being rushed or jam-packing our schedule
* Can take it slow exploring the city on our last few days in Italy before we fly home

Cons:

* More touristy and smaller city than Florence, so potentially more crowded
* More expensive than Florence
* Would have to change our flight to fly out of Venice (currently flying out of Rome), which is \~$150 extra per person
* Further out than Florence and would be a longer transport to get to Venice from Rome

  
**Florence**

Pros:

* More convenient city to fit into our current schedule as we will be in the Amalfi Coast and Rome. If we go to Florence, we would start in the Amalfi Coast, go to Florence, then end and fly out of Rome.
* We won't have to change our flight back home and we can still fly out of Rome
* We heard the food is better in Florence

Cons:

* Venice to me seems so much prettier than Florence
* Florence is bigger and seems to have more things to do, which we won't be able to do all in 2 days. I'm sure we can fit in a few highlights but will it be worth going there for 2 days?

Italy Itinerary Help please! Venice & the North,"Salve!
My partner and I will be in Italy in early July, spending the first week with my family in Montepulciano. For the second week, we’re trying to shape an itinerary (last minute lol) that balances adventure & rest… while making the most of Italy’s abundant beauty.

We’ll be taking the train to Venice after our family time and staying there for 2 nights. I know it’ll be peak tourist season, but something about Venice ~ the romance, is calling to me. We were both there as kids, and I’d love to experience it again as our adult selves, even briefly.

After Venice, we’re weighing two main options:

Option A: Lake Garda + Dolomites
- Pick up a rental car after Venice
- Spend a couple days relaxing around Lake Garda (swimming, exploring towns, maybe a bike ride)
-  drive up into the Dolomites for hiking, mountain views, and fresh air

Option B: Lake Maggiore + Switzerland
- Drive from Venice to Lake Maggiore for 1–2 days of lakeside downtime
- Then cross into Switzerland (thinking Lucerne or Interlaken area) for hiking and alpine scenery…? 

What matters most to us:
- culture, great food (that’s a given!)
- Swimming in lakes or natural water 
- hikes and mountain views
- maybe bike ride or two would be great
- A mix of outdoorsy adventure and a couple slow / not feeling go-go-go every single day

We’re not trying to cram everything in, but also want to soak in what the north has to offer without backtracking too much. Any feedback on:

:  Which lakes are more swimmable/fun in July

:  Favorite Dolomites towns or hikes for a short stay?

:  Is Lucerne or Interlaken better for a 1-2 night stay coming from Italy? (Or elsewhere in Switzerland)? 

:  Would you skip Venice in favor of more nature time - or is 2 nights manageable without it ruining the pace?

To anyone who made it through this long read: 🙏🏼 Grazie mille!
We’re so excited; and also a bit overwhlemed.  🇮🇹 💚 🤍 ♥️ ",1,7,1748918811.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1l212nb/italy_itinerary_help_please_venice_the_north/,Global-Spread6090

Italy itinerary suggestions…Milan-Bolzano-Venice,"We are taking a trip at the end of July for seven nights. One night in Milan, 4 nights in Bolzano, 2 nights in Venice. It’s four sisters, 35-45yrs old and our parents, both in 70s and neither are very active. This trip is for my mom who will be turning 70 while there and is stage 4 cancer. Though she has very minimal symptoms, she is sensitive to heat and cannot go very long homes. I want her to experience great food, lovely people, and beautiful scenery. 

A few questions: 

I have been contemplating not doing 4 nights in Bolzano and instead stopping at Lake Garda for two night either on the way to or from Bolzano. My worry is that it will add more stress with the hotel changes but I also think she would love it based on the pictures. I also just find water healing.

If the consensus is that Lake Garda is doable and worth it, I would love an itinerary suggestion, specifically if it’s easier to stop there after leaving Milan or easier leaving Bolzano- the plan is to take a train to Bolzano but also can rent a car (or two) if that will be easier. 

Day trip suggestions from Bolzano? We are staying in Castle Hörtenberg. 

Hotel suggestions in Venice -easy location, great views, also a nice place to relax as I do think my mom will be tired by the end of the trip. 

Any thoughts and ideas are appreciated!

I would need to remove a day from either Rome or Florence and have to move luggage/rooms twice in 2 days which may be annoying.

My question is can anyone share things i should book now. Reservations for recommended restaurants or certain activities would be very helpful. Certainly don't want 100 things planned but would like 2 to 3 in each location. 

In Dolomites I wanted to go paragliding with my son. Should we book this ahead of time and with who if anyone knows. 

Also flying out of Milan. Any recommendations for hotels close to MXP airport?

"11- day Itinerary: Venice, Bologna, Florence, and Rome","My partner and I leave for Italy on May 30 and planned out the below itinerary. We have tickets for the big tourist activities so those are pretty set in stone, but would love any other input on how to spend our free time or general advice/feedback. I also know this is fast paced for some, but I don’t know if/when we’ll return so we want to accomplish a lot. On the other hand, any validation that this schedule isn’t ridiculous is definitely appreciated! 

Day 1: overnight flight to Venice, arrive the morning of May 31. No plans this day except checking into the hotel, wandering around to Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco, and taking everything in. Sleep in Venice.

Day 2: Doge’s Palace mid-morning. I also have tickets to the Correr museum but if we’re feeling taking a ferry to Murano in the afternoon instead we’ll do that. Sleep in Venice. 

Day 3: St. Mark’s Basilica first thing in the morning. Noon-ish train to Bologna. Check into hotel in Bologna. Walk around/eat in city center. Sleep in Bologna. 

Day 4: 5-hour tour to Parmesan factory, balsamic vinegar distillery, and winery outside of Bologna. Dinner/strolling around in Bologna. Sleep in Bologna.

Day 5: Breakfast in Bologna. Noon-ish train to Florence. Do Rick Steves walk/stroll to see duomo and Palazzo Vecchio. Sleep in Florence. 

Day 6: Morning climb Giotto’s tower. Stroll/shop and lunch. Uffizi at 3 pm. Michelangelo Piazza for sunset. Sleep in Florence. 

Day 7: Accademia in the morning then either stroll around Florence or day trip to Siena or San Gimignano. Sleep in Florence. 

Day 8: Breakfast then mid-morning train to Rome. Vatican Museums/Sistine Chapel at 1:30. Dinner, stroll, sleep in Rome. 

Day 9: No plans! Maybe Garden of oranges or strolling Monti or Travestere? Vatican will probably be packed this day with Jubilee events so staying away. Sleep in Rome. 

Day 10: Early morning Trevi Fountain. Coliseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill. Sleep in Rome.

Day 11: St. Peter’s Basilica then climb the dome. Villa Borghese. Evening Borghese Gallery. Walk to Spanish Steps for sunset. Sleep in Rome.

Day 12: Early morning train to the airport and we’re out! ",2,6,1747753692.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kr78fw/11_day_itinerary_venice_bologna_florence_and_rome/,cleo-moses

Need advice on whether or not to cancel Venice trip ,"I was planning a trip for February 15th-22nd since that’s when school vacation is for the school I work at, and decided on Venice. Part of the reason for Venice was due to me incorrectly thinking the Venice Carnival was taking place then. I booked my flight today. 

As it turns out, the Carnival is the week after I will be there (my info source for the start date was incorrect). Now I’m debating if I should cancel my flight and look at other trips, or if I should just roll with it and still go to Venice. It’s a bit disheartening knowing I’ll be missing such a big event by a week. 

I’ve never traveled abroad, and I know Venice will be great at that time of year. 

I also plan to backpack in Europe this summer, so I’m hoping to do a destination for February that wouldn’t typically be part of a European backpacking trip. 

I appreciate any advice or insight that will help me decide whether or not I should cancel and find a different trip. ",13,35,1725063337.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f5acb6/need_advice_on_whether_or_not_to_cancel_venice/,GiganticTuba

Travel pics of 2024,"A summary of my trips throughout the year. Images are in order.

Started 2024 with a trip to Budapest (1/13) - where I spent 3,5 days. In February, a weekend in Strasbourg and Colmar (2/13); in March, a week in Warsaw (3/13) and Krakow - about 3 days in each city.

In May, went to Salzburg (4/13) for a day trip. I currently live in Munich so it's a short train ride from there, about 2hrs. In June, I spent two weeks in Italy: flew from Munich to Naples (stayed 3 days), then Rome (4 days), Florence (5/13; 3 days), and Venice (2 days).

Throughout the Summer, went to the Greek island of Zakynthos (6/13) for about 4 days and also visited some places across Germany (7/13; Schloss Neuschwanstein in the image). In September, spent a weekend in Liechtenstein (8/13) and, from there, went to St. Gallen, Switzerland (9/13).

In October flew from Munich to Barcelona (10/13) and, while there, took a train to Girona (4 days in total). After that, flew to the Azores - São Miguel (11/13) and Terceira Islands (5 days in total). 

To wrap up the year, flew from Munich to Luxembourg (12/13) earlier this month, spent over 1,5 days there, and then took a train to Belgium, where I visited Ghent (13/13), Bruges, Antwerp and Brussels for about a week.",3460,64,1735598236.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpzl9p,rubesf9

"London, Paris, Venice, Rome!","hi guys! new to traveling and my first big trip i'm planning with one of my friends is for summer 2026. we're hoping visit London, Paris, Venice, and Rome.

Edit: Okay totally impossible haha. If I I decide to split 10 days into London & Paris, is there anywhere else in France that I could stay & still be able to travel to Paris from? I'm not really looking to stay IN Paris but rather a place a train ride away (personal preference, probably not logical but i don't care much haha).

To Venice or Not to Venice?,"Appreciate if the kind people of this forum could share your views in the context of the following:

* We fly into Milan at the dawn of 9 March and leave from Rome FCO on the midday of 17 March (8 nights).
* This is a family vacation with my sister and mother. Thankfully, both are able to walk/travel long distances without issue. We are very fast travellers and enjoy a packed itinerary. We will travel using public transport. If it will grant us more time, we are open to booking a private transfer to get us from one region to the next to have the opportunity to visit minor towns along the way.
* Our interests generally are views (natural beauty, grand architecture or general setting) and food.
* Our later half of the trip is spilt between Florence and Rome. Rome is fixed as the last spot as we depart from FCO. Florence is up for discussion but based on good reviews from friends and family, we wish to visit. We anticipate to spend around 5 nights for these 2 spots.
* This is our first trip to Italy and third trip to Europe. We have visited Germany (mid March) and Switzerland (early June) previously. While we generally had a great time in the alpine regions, we found ourselves disappointed with Neuschwanstein Castle and Lucerne due to the over-commercialisation and the overhyping of the attractions. Dare I say it, we personally thought that they were tourist trap locations. To be fair, we went in off-season so it was not even the crowds getting to us. Places we loved include Zugspitze, Mittenwald, Munich, Vevey, Zermatt, Oeschinensee, Bernese Oberland.

The dilemma now really boils down whether we should visit Venice or another spot.

Pros for Venice: It's Venice and Venice is iconic. We get to say that we have visited Venice.

Cons for Venice: It's really touristy and we know from our past experience that we may not always love touristy destinations.

The other places currently up for discussion are:

\- Genoa and Liguria in general (stay in Genoa)

\- Ravenna and San Marino (we may opt to stay in Rimini to simplify the change in hotels)

I got lightly scammed in Istanbul and found it funny,"Last fall I was in Istanbul for my first time. I'm walking up a street to see some great views of the city. A shoe shine guy accidentally drops his shoe brush. I hand it back to him as he walks past. He doesn't speak English. But insists on giving my shoes a shine!

I let him even though my shoes didn't need it. Silly me... I'm assuming it's to say thank you. He holds out his hand for money after.

I was a $5.50 lesson for me. I can appreciate an honest hustle (or at least a cheap one) and I found it a little charming.

\[EDIT: Part of traveling is encountering the occasional scam, cheat, and hustle. You can either learn from them (ideal), worry too much about avoiding them, or find them funny. If you let this worry ruin your vacation, you're probably better off vacationing a little closer to home or avoiding some of the neatest places on the planet\].

4 nights in Rome or 3 nights in Rome and 2 in Venice?,"We are going on a trip to Europe in September and will be visiting Munich (3 nights), Vienna (2 nights), Prague (2-3 nights), Rome (4 nights) and Paris (4 nights).

I was wondering if we should add 2 nights in Venice by removing one from Rome. 

On many threads on here I have read that people don’t like Venice as much, so I’m not sure.

On our last trip we went to Istanbul and Cappadocia. While we really enjoyed Istanbul with those small alleys, bars, restaurants in Istiklal, we really hated Cappadocia because it was just too small and boring and mostly looked like a tourist trap. 

What do you guys think? ",0,35,1708865247.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1azn4ku/4_nights_in_rome_or_3_nights_in_rome_and_2_in/,SayedHasmi
Christmas day in Florence or Venice?,"I just scored a stupidly cheap flight to Bologna from the UK (£1 cheap!!) for the 19 December and returning the 27 December. I love Bologna, have spent 3 days in Florence a couple of years ago and never visited Venice. 

So my question to all Italian travellers,  it really helps if you've been over Xmas too..
do I try to fit all 3 in (trains run every day) or just do Bologna and Venice. I believe Bologna and Florence both go all out for Xmas markets, events and decorations.

Final hours of my 16 months around the world trip,"**TLDR:** Made redundant at the end of 2022, didn't want to find another job. Packed up and travelled the world.

**update** done for now, flight soon, thanks for the questions. 

**update 2** ok really done now, boarding.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down. That coupled with the fact that we were cooped up after some of the most longest and strictest lockdowns it was time to get out and see the world.

The objective of the travels was essentially to explore and ""live"", as you will see most of the places we stayed were capital Cities. We ended up doing ALOT of day trips from the major capitals either by train or tour company. Most of the time it was much cheaper just to do a full day tour than to actually hire a car for the day.

Most of the places we stayed were booked through either [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Airbnb (booking.com was a much cheaper option most of the time)

"16 Day Italy Itinerary - Into Rome, Out of Venice!","Hey all,

I am in the beginning stages of planning mine and my spouse's 16 day trip to Italy. We finally got approval from our work, and this is our first vacation in 18 months so we are really looking forward to it. 

We will be landing in Rome and departing out of Venice. Tentatively we are looking at mostly equal days in the following:

Rome (4 days) > Florence (3 days) > Cinque Terre (3 days) > Bologna (3 days) > Venice (3 days)

We will take the train to each location. I am curious if we are missing anything by not going down to the amalfi coast? We have done similar trips like this and that 3 days is our sweet spot so don't mind getting up and going onto the next. We are considering taking out Bologna to extend a day in each place to make it 4 days even split in the above.

"Advice for Europe Travel - Time in Rome, Florence, Venice, and Paris","Hi! I am heading to europe for about a month this summer and am looking for advice on timing of my trip. I am very interested in art and want to explore museums, but I still do want time to explore the cities. I am planning on 8.5 days in rome (I don't have much flexibility here, I will be spending four of those days taking half day painting classes, and one day with a full day painting class), 7 or 8 days in florence (once again, I will spend five of those days taking painting classes in the mornings - I'll be done at noon each day. Additionally, I would like to take some day trips out of florence, like siena or cinque terra), 3-4 days in venice, and then either 6.5 or 5.5 days in paris (I won't be taking classes, but I would like time to sit and paint. I also want to do a day trip to monet's gardens). 

My question is, should I spend 7 days in florence, 4 in venice, 6.5 in paris, OR 8 days in florence, 3 days in venice, 6.5 in Paris, OR 8 days in Florence, 4 days in venice, 5.5 in Paris. This really just comes down to spending an extra day in Florence, venice, or paris.

Venice/Slovenia Itinerary critique,"Hi all! Heading to Slovenia (with brief stop in Venice) in September. Plane and hotels are booked (most hotels have free cancellation however). Was wondering if anyone who has been there has any ideas/critique of the plan below. Thanks!

Info: mid-30s couple, experienced/active travelers. Love nature/hiking/exploring cities. We walk A TON (like typically 30k+ steps a day on vacation, hit over 50k last trip- that was a bit insane however) so are not intimidated by lots of walking

* Sept 7: Arrive in Venice by plane at 2 pm (from NE USA).  Staying in the Dorsoduro area. Just walk around/get food near hotel.

* Sept 8: Full day Venice- main goal is to explore outdoors/walk a ton and get a feel for Venice rather than see a ton of attractions. But, I do love art history so thinking we will do a tour of St. Mark’s Basillica. If you could only go to 1-3 attractions in Venice, where would you choose??

* Sept 9: Morning in Venice. Then, Venice—> Ljubljana. Still figuring out best public transport for this, but likely will do train that stops in Trieste. Is it worth getting out at Trieste along the way and exploring for a few hours? Or should we just head right to Ljubljana (not sure if more than 1 day is needed to explore city)? There is also option for FlixBus but I am not very familiar with that. Staying in Ljubljana at night.

* Sept 10: Ljubljana- full day to explore main sites (Dragon bridge, castle, old town area, Tivoli gardens, riverfront). ? Walking tour 

* Sept 11: Ljubljana—>Lake Bled—> Lake Bohinj.  Pick up rental car and leave  early for Bled. Boat to Bled Island, see castle, hike to Ojstrica/Mala Osojnica viewpoints, walk around the lake, try Bled cream cake. Stay in Lake Bohinj

* Sept 12: our anniversary. This day needs work… Drive 1 hr to Kranjska Gora.  Zelenci Nature Reserve, Lake Jasna. ? Drive 20 min to Italian alpine lakes (looks like no border issues? ) Check out Laghi di Fusine, spend 1-2 hr around Lago di Fusine Superiore. Maybe check out Triplice Confine (border of Italy, Austria and Slovenia). Time dependent, may do Martuljek Waterfall hike or Pericnik Waterfall Hike. 
Dinner reservations at Milka Restaurant (our first Michelin starred restaurant). Stay back in Bohinj

* Sept 13: Go to Triglav National Park. Do day long hike, likely Seven Lakes Valley hike . Stay in Bohinj.

* Sept 14: stay around Lake Bohinj. Check out Vintgar Gorge and Mostnica Gorge, Vogar panorama hike. Chill in evening?

* Sept 15: check out and drive to Ljubljana early for 10:30 am flight home

Venice vs Copenhagen vs San Juan,"
Choosing a trip between Venice and Copenhagen in October for 4 days. I'm looking to get out and about to experience the culture, be a tourist, pretend to be a local. I love trying local food, coffee, pastries, desserts, beer, wine, etc. This trip I want to party a bit, meet new people, maybe dance, get drunk. I do not want to walk around all day, and lounge in the hostel at night. My budget is going to be no less than $500 to spend in the city. 

Venice

* It's Italy
* Italian food, wine, etc
* Beautiful architecture, vibes, great histories (history nerd)
* Can travel to other islands, cities quickly 

  
Copenhagen

* Will be arriving for Kulturnatten, their yearly culture night
* Danish food
* Seems to have more of a party scene
* Can purchase a culture pass giving me access to transport and museums 

  
San Juan

* Seems to be the one with the most LGBTQ neighborhood/party options
* Would be doing this more for the excursions, not food
* Have a walking tour, Bicardi rum tasting, scuba diving, kayaking, waterfalls on the list
* Con: hurricane season

  
I've read on this thread that Venice is pretty much only tourists and I've seen some negative reviews. I don't think I've read any negative review on Copenhagen in here. Honestly, I feel that there is not one perk over the other in my decision and the main difference is the vibe and food.

What was your best travel destination of this year?,"This year, I had the chance to visit Alberobello in Italy’s Puglia region, and it was amazing. The town is full of trulli houses (small white stone buildings with cone-shaped roofs) which I found very unique.

If you visit there, walk through Rione Monti (the central area of the city) and try out taralli.

also, if you're into some easy hiking, climb up to the Belvedere Santa Lucia, a watch the trulli houses from above. 

  
Visit Trullo Sovrano, the trulli house turned into a museum now and if you got any chances visit nearby towns like Locorotondo and Matera as well. Theyre beautiful and full of charm.

I would add these small towns to the hidden gems if you're into unique places to travel to.",194,461,1734427603.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hg6zra/what_was_your_best_travel_destination_of_this_year/,redditusers21
"Help with Italy itinerary - Rome, Genoa, Venice, Amalfi Coast","We're looking to bring our 4 kids to Italy next August but hoping for a little bit of guidance on things to do & how long to stay in each city. We spent 2.5 weeks in Paris/London this year and loved it.

We'll be there next August, flying into Rome. I love history, architecture, trying new/good food. We're more than happy spending all day walking around some days, but relaxing and enjoying the scenery/landscape the next. 

I think we'd ideally like to spend 3-4 days in each city before hopping on a train to the next. My wife's big thing is shopping, so we *might* stop in Milan for a day on our way to Venice from Genoa. 

As of now, here are the main things we're looking to do: 

\- Colosseum, because of course

\- Vatican for a day

\- Olive oil tasting

\- Make our own pasta, mainly for the kids. They'd have fun with it.

Paris to Monaco to Venice by train,"We're planning a family trip from Paris to Monaco to Venice and back.

Does anyone have any advice for the best route of travel using trains?

The current plan route is Paris to Nice/Monaco to Genoa to Cinque Terre to Venice (via Pisa/Florence/Bologna).

Traveling back to Paris we plan to travel west to Milan to Turin to Geneva and back to Paris. 

We traveled extensively last year in between Rome and Venice using the Italian train system, so we're used to hopping around quickly and seeing a lot of tourist sites in little time. 

Are there any issues or anything I should know about as far as traveling using the French train system into Switzerland or also transferring into Italy? 

I assume for all trains you have to buy your ticket before boarding? 

Is it worth stopping at any of the cities in between Venice and Milan? 

We will be taking about 2 and 1/2 to 3 weeks for the trip. 

Any advice for the travel route will be welcomed.

Advice on traveling to Italy (2 week trip in September: Rome -> Sardinia -> [?] -> Venice),"My wife and I are planning our first trip to Italy in September for 2 weeks.

What about Cinque Terre? It looks like it's more accessible from Pisa than Lake Como is from any major airports but I also have no idea. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Also, if there are any other spots that you feel would be a good alternative to either spots then please share.

Pickpocketing gone violent and bystander effect,"Sorry if this is kind of a dumb post. While at the train station in Venice, Italy, someone tried to pickpocket my stepfather, who fought back and ended up falling over and breaking his hip. My mom said the most disturbing part was the fact no one tried to help, that everyone kind of just either watched or continued on. 

I feel so sad for my mom, who is alone and not super tech savvy, got kicked out of the hospital, had to find the hotel alone, and is now scared to navigate the city alone. They’re transferring my stepfather to Roma for surgery and my mom has to haul all of their luggage to Roma by herself. I know this sounds very first world “poor American tourist”, but my mom is so heartbroken and scared. 

Maybe it’s because I’ve taken too many CPR classes and first aid; I knew the bystander effect is a real thing, but I can’t even imagine being knocked down crying in pain while everyone just stared and judged me as the dumb American tourist.

I can’t judge too hard because I don’t know what I would do if an elderly man fell after almost being robbed. I’d like to think I’d offer a hand. I remember some girl fainted on the bus two years ago and I helped her off and waited for the ambulance, offered to go with her. But idk, is that just American culture?

Day 1 - late arrival in Venice

Day 2 - exploring Venice

Day 3 - Flixbus to Piran (arrival at 4pm-ish)

Day 4, 5 - full days in Piran - we plan to visit Predjama castle on one of those days and explore Piran on the other.  
Day 6 - we move to Lubljana. And this is where it gets tricky - I thought what maybe, since Postojna is somewhere in between Lubljana and Piran we can stop there, visit Postojna caves, and then move to Lubljana but I'm struggling finding connections (buses, trains) that make sense. Am I missing something or it's better to just go to Lublajana and plan a day trip from there?   
Day 7, 8, 9 - we're staying in Lublana and plan to explore the city as well as see: Lake Bled, Lake Bohinjsko, Vintgar Gorge.

If you've been to either Verona or Venice, or perhaps both, we'd love to hear about your experiences and get some advice. What factors should we consider in making our decision? Any must-see attractions or hidden gems we shouldn't miss in either city?

Venice - ‘Different’ Things To Do?,"Going to Venice later this month - weather might not be as good but hopefully not as many tourists.

Thought to post here asking as per the title if anyone who’s been had anything in mind that’s perhaps different from what is usually suggested?  Obviously I’ll still look to visit places such as those in St Mark’s Square, but thought if anyone had any recommendations for things that are perhaps not as well known/tips?  Or if it’s best to pre-book anything/anywhere this time of year?

Thanks in advance 👍",9,18,1699750898.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/17t8vz8/venice_different_things_to_do/,No_Doubt_About_That

Venice to Budapest- Options,"I will be taking a 10 day trip, which begins as a 3 day stay in Venice, then cycling to Trieste for 7 days.  On the last day, we take a ferry back to Venice, presumably arriving in the late afternoon.  I have found (by far) the cheapest airfare back home to the states departs from Budapest.  That decision is already made.  The few options to get to Budapest from Venice:

1.) Stay over in Venice that last night, sleep in, take an afternoon flight, and stay in the Budapest airport hotel that night… never leaving the airport. 
2.) Wake up earlier to catch a morning flight, take the bus into the city of Budapest (never been), stay in a hotel in city center, bus back to the airport the following morning.  
3.) Take an overnight train to Munich the day we take the ferry back, sleep on the train (almost 9 hour trip), arrive at 6am, connect to Budapest on a 7am train, have the afternoon there, stay in a hotel in the city, bus to the airport the following morning.  Since I would be saving on a hotel room, I would spring for a a bed on the overnight portion. 

-I am way more familiar/comfortable with planes, so while the 3rd option sounds the most adventurous, I’d be anxious about something going wrong with one of the trains and not knowing what to do from there. 
-We'll be staying in different hotels every night  and cycling about 40-50 miles a day, plus I have a long 2 days of traveling back home to Ohio… so I’m trying to imagine how I’ll feel about having a cool experience of seeing a new city vs. just wanting to take it easy at the end of the trip.  
-My flight departs Budapest at 4pm. 
-FWIW I’m 38.  Thought this might help because 15 years ago, I could have done any of these options without even considering sleep lol.",6,13,1706359993.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1aca7kt/venice_to_budapest_options/,FreeAsAbird33
Tips for Carnival in Venice?,"Hello, 
My friend and I are planning a trip to Venice for Carnival next year and I would love to get some tips/advice from anyone who's been. 
Neither of us have attended Carnival before. Would you recommend staying the whole time or only the beginning/end? Do a lot of visitors dress up? 
I've been to Venice twice but only as day trips so have never stayed overnight. Any areas you'd recommend for a hotel? Anything we should watch out for or be aware of? 
Thank you!",2,7,1715333719.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1colimz/tips_for_carnival_in_venice/,Kanananan
Rome airport to Venice ,"Hi,

I'm travelling to Italy in May, thinking to BOOK a transportation from Rome airport (FCO? ) to Venice. 

Im arriveingat at Rome around noon then would like to take a train to Venice. 

But I'm worried that there will be delays on the flight or getting out if the airport and I would miss the train I booked. 

What do you think? 

Would you just buy the ticket when you get there? 
Or
Is the ticket refundable and I could get a different time if I miss the train? 

This is my first solo trip and first time in Europe. 
Any recommendations and suggestions will be appreciated! 

Thank you in advance!

Spend more time in Venice or Florence?,"My girlfriend and I are traveling to Italy and want to spend 3 days in one of these cities and 2 in the other. We thought Florence would be the clear choice to spend more time in but after watching travel guide videos of Venice and Florence, it seems like there is more to do in Venice. Any advice would be much appreciated.",14,45,1649014035.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/tvhhp9/spend_more_time_in_venice_or_florence/,dannybravo121
Venice Rolling Card/Venezia Unica - great deal or I am missing something? details below," I am 29, so I am looking into the Rolling Card and Venezia Unica for the 3 full days I will be in Venice. My math is currently telling me I will be saving, but the website is so confusing that I feel like I am missing something. The few blog posts I could find about the card made it sound you wouldn't save anything with it, so I am looking for confirmation.

&#x200B;

* Rolling Card and Venezia Unica I plan to get:
   * The Rolling Card plus ACTV 3 day transport - 28-euro
   * Museum Pass reduced fare that covers the 12 civic museums - 22-euro
   * Peggy Guggenheim museum - 10.50-euro
   * Total - 60.50-euro

&#x200B;

* Things I plan to do (with the full prices)
   * Visit Burano and Murano - 22.5-euro in Vaporetto rides, plus 17-euro for the two museum tickets
   * Doge's Palace and Correr Museum - 25-euro combo ticket
   * Visit Giorgio Maggiore Island - 7.50-euro Vaporetto ride
   * Palazzo Mocenigo - 11-euro
   * Peggy Guggenheim museum - 17.50-euro
   * Total - 100.50-euro

&#x200B;

So, if my math is right, I would save at least 40-euro, if not more if I plan to go to any other museum or go on more public transportation in those 3 days.

&#x200B;

* Questions  
I am confused if I am eligible for the reduced Museum Pass with just the Rolling Card, or do I need to be a student also?
   * Same for the reduced ticket to the Peggy Gugenheim Museum?
   * How long is the museum pass good for, a specific amount of time or just one entrance per museum?

"Italy 14 Day Trip (Late July-August) - Hoping to do Venice, Florence, Rome, and Amalfi - Is it Possible?","Hello, I am looking to plan a honeymoon trip to Italy, probably lasting from mid July to early August where we would have about 14 full travel days in Italy (not including travel to and from). The places we would like to see most are Rome, Florence, Venice, and the Amalfi Coast. We are planning to do most of our travel by train since driving seems a bit difficult in Italy, and I was wondering is this even possible to hit all these places in that span, or would we be stretching ourselves too thin and be too busy? We would probably have to fly into Rome for price/travel point usage reasons, and I know Venice is quite geographically separated from these other regions which likely makes it a bit tougher.

Also a few other questions if anyone is willing to help out further: 

\- Is it going to be too crowded during this time to even enjoy ourselves, or will we be ok if we don't mind a bit of a crowd? 

\- How many days do you think are required to see each of these places effectively? 

\- Does anyone have good hotel recommendations for places that are reasonably priced/centrally located in these regions? I don't need anything fancy, just decent, clean rooms as we probably plan to be moving around most of the time and mostly just sleeping in our hotels. 

\- Also open to any suggestions for activities or places to eat in these areas if you have the time :) 

Thanks for any help you can provide, it's much appreciated! ",3,14,1704750776.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/191x7mr/italy_14_day_trip_late_julyaugust_hoping_to_do/,uclabucsfan

Train from Switzerland (Wengen) to Italy (Venice) questions and travel passes,"My wife and I will be in Switzerland from Aug 21 -25th staying in Wengen. On the 25th we will need to take a train from Wengen to Venice and I had a few questions. When searching for trains on raileurope I am getting prices of about $150 per person. I had the following questions.


Is there a preferred train when going from Zurich to Milan with better views? Is it worth the longer travel time or price? What is the best website to book the train?


Should I pre-book this train as we do need to leave and arrive at a precise time.


Does getting any type of travel pass make sense? We will be in Switzerland for 4 days and Italy for about 8 days. In Switzerland we'll be using the train quite a lot getting from Wengen to Interlaken, Lauterbrunen, Grindlewald, and back to Zurich. In Italy we will be traveling from Milan to Venice to Florence and to Rome.


Any other tips or advice?",0,2,1721234795.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e5mzgn/train_from_switzerland_wengen_to_italy_venice/,jmutiny1993
