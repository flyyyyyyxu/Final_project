"Traveling in Amsterdam, Netherlands for the first time. What should I be aware of/ see?","Me and my mom are going to be doing a mom and daughter trip to Amsterdam Netherlands this spring (April).

I am aware that there is going to be a tulip festival during the spring and would like to visit a flower garden. We are not sure what else we should plan to go see in Amsterdam besides the Dam, Windmills, Van Gogh Museum.

We we’re already able to book Plane tickets but hotels seem really expensive during spring season so does anyone happen to know any affordable hotels kind of near Amsterdam’s city center? We’re looking for somewhere affordable because most of the time, we are planning to be out.

Has anyone had experience or can recommend things we can do in the Netherlands?

Additionally, what type of transportation should we use in the Netherlands? I’ve searched that Uber is better, cheaper, and safer for women but I’m not entirely sure.

This would help lots! Thank you!",0,66,1740342229.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1iwjk1b/traveling_in_amsterdam_netherlands_for_the_first/,x0xog0ssipg1rl

"Paris to Amsterdam, is the train ride memorable?","Three of us are traveling to Europe in August, and will be spending several days in Paris then traveling to Amsterdam.

We can fly from Paris to Amsterdam for $269 USD for all 3 of us combined. The flight is 1 hour and 15 minutes, but of course we would have to spend time sitting in the airport and on the runway so probably 2-3 hours total.

Or a train ride would be $546 USD for all 3 of us combined (which I think would either be first class or business class, the missus looked it up so I'm not sure). The train ride would be 3 hours and 25 minutes.

"Amsterdam --> Buenos Aires, where to do 2-3 day layover? Miami, Charleston, Nashville or Dallas","Hi everyone,

I am planning a trip to Argentina later this year in November. I will be flying with Delta Air Lines which means I will have a layover in the US. I'd like to visit one of these cities (Miami, Charleston, Nashville or Dallas) for about 2-3 days before heading onwards to Argentina.

What would you recommend? I'm mostly into history, culture, good food and nice bars.

Thanks

EDIT: Thanks for all the recommendations. I'm getting a lot of hate for considering Dallas LOL, but I was mainly considering it for the Texan culture and the food scene, but I get it, I won't go there haha...

Also, I can either fly directly to Miami or Charleston/Nashville via NYC, so there's no layover in Atlanta. Based on the advice here, I'll probably go to Miami but I'm considering Charleston too. I'll sleep on it tonight! Thanks for the tips in any case :)

What to combine with Amsterdam?,"Hey all! My husband and I have a 7 day trip (excluding travel days) this fall, flying in and out of Amsterdam. We know that we will be spending the last 4 days of the trip in Amsterdam, but we wanted to visit another city/country that is accessible by train for the first 3 days of the trip. On our short list was somewhere in Belgium (such as Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent), somewhere in western Germany such as Cologne, or somewhere in France right over the Belgian border such as Reims or Lille. We have never traveled to this area of the world before, and our concern is picking somewhere that has enough to do for a 3 day stay (have heard from some people that some of these places only need a day to see everything there is to see). 

A little about us, we enjoy visiting museums, exploring the local food and drink scene, and just wandering around to take in the architecture/history. Our favorite places we’ve traveled thus far have been Barcelona and Seville.

"Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Vienna, or Zurich","I am planning a trip for April 2026 of approximately 2 weeks in length. I currently have an itinerary of Rome-Barcelona. On a previous trip to Europe we visited Prague (liked), Paris (didn’t like), Florence (liked), Rome (liked).  I have previously been to Copenhagen as well, which I enjoyed. My SO spent quite a bit of time in Switzerland 30+ years ago, but I’ve not been.

We talked about going back to Rome someday, hence the current itinerary. However, this is going to be only our second trip to Europe as a couple (first trip was >10 years ago) and we don’t get to travel to Europe very often. We also have a friend in London that we’d like to visit so I am considering replacing Rome with another city to see other parts of Europe and adding London, and would like some advice on which city to possibly substitute.

About us:
- We prefer not to move hotels too often, so we want to be in a city 3-5 full days and move at a more relaxed pace
- we like food, culture, and museums (art and national history, not the more niche ones like spy museums etc). A museum visit will likely take most of our day unless it’s really small
- walking yes biking no
- Hyatt globalist and Marriott Platinum, but could really use the nights for Hyatt so that would be my strong preference 

I am building an alternate itinerary to bring up with my SO. Between Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Vienna, and Zurich, which one should I add to London and Barcelona, and what makes you say that?

I just took my first big international vacation and it wasn’t what I expected it to be.,"I’ve been planning this trip to Switzerland for months. It was my first big trip out of North America. I’ve been up to Montreal for work and down to Cancun for a couple of days, but that’s it.  This 9 day trip to Switzerland was supposed to be magical. 

I was super excited to see another part of the world, experience a new culture, try new foods, and see the Swiss alps.

Even better, my 11 year old son was coming on the trip and my sister (in Ireland) was going to meet us there!

I budgeted the shit out of this trip and budgeted/planned so well that I actually ended the trip $975 under budget.

Well, the trip comes and it wasn’t what I expected.  My son was as grumpy most of the trip from being jet lagged. He didn’t want to walk anywhere and hated how busy our days were. I was trying to keep him happy and keep up with my sister’s energy (she’s used to traveling around Europe). But it was hard and I couldn’t enjoy all the magical views and places I imagined.

Day 6 comes and we’ve done almost everything on the itinerary. I walk into my son’s room that evening and he’s just crying in bed. Turns out he was really homesick and tired of being away from his mom and friends. He didn’t like the food, his allergies had been killing him, and he was just exhausted.

Of course, as a dad, this breaks my heart, but then sends me into panic/anxiety mode and I’m trying to figure out how to fix it. My idea? Cut the trip short by two days.

I propose the idea to my sister and she hates it. She goes to talk to my son to try to encourage him to push through but he wasn’t having it. He was done. So I cancel out last hotel (full refund) and change our flights at no cost.  My sister gets all her stuff figured out as well. (I paid for almost everything we did on the trip. Lodging, tours, transit, most food, etc). So I didn’t feel bad cutting the trip short. I even paid for the fee it cost to change her flight.

The morning we are to travel back to the US, I wake up sick with fatigue, sore throat, and a fever. We travel by train from interlaken to Zurich for two hours, wait 3 hrs for our flight, fly to Amsterdam after a 30 min delayed flight. Then we rush halfway across the airport to get on our flight to Atlanta and it’s delayed over and hour because of mechanical issues.  Then I sit on a plane for 9 hrs with an exhausted son and being sick myself. (I wore a mask, constantly used hand sanitizer, and informed the FAs who sat me and my son in an isolated part of the plane since it was mostly empty).

All-in-all, this magical trip I had been planning for months just wasn’t that great to be honest.  My son says he really liked the trip and so did my sister, but I just felt anxious and stressed the entire time.


Although my budget was great, we did most of the items on the itinerary, and saw beautiful views, I couldn’t enjoy it.

It really bummed me out and now I have no desire to travel anymore.  My son actually had been begging me to go to Japan this summer and I was going to take him, but in the flight home he asked me to cancel it. He doesn’t want to travel anymore this year.

Maybe I’ll want to travel one more time this year, but I think it’ll be by myself and for a shorter period of time and close to home. I love my son but I just don’t know if he is ready for such big trips.


Anyways, rants/thoughts over.



Edit: the main point of this story is that I put too much hope in this trip and idealized it.  My son did nothing wrong, we just didn’t know this trip would take such a toll on us.  For what it’s worth, I was super homesick as well and felt panicked about the fact I was so far from home and felt trapped.

Edit 2: the biggest issue for my son was his allergies. The Airbnb was dusty and the owner lived next door and had two dogs. On top of that, my sister has a cat back in Ireland and my son is very allergic to cats.  He stayed loaded up on all allergy meds and they made him tired. We did have a lot of down time and slept in, but his allergies really bothered him. I think it was mostly a mismatch between him and my sister unfortunately. Her cat dander on her clothes and such were really beating his allergies up.


Last edit: my son wanted to go on this trip just as much as me.  He looked up items he wanted to do, food he wanted to try and we planned it together.  We planned for jet lag (lazy day the first day) and we did one or two things a day once we realized how busy we’d be. We skipped a lot on the itinerary.  If I were to do things differently, I would have done all the mountain activities first and then stay in the city for the last two days.  I would have done a hotel or an Airbnb with no pets and I would have asked my sister to wash all her stuff thoroughly.  Overall, my son tells me he really liked the trip, he just had a hard time after a few days and such.  He loved the plane ride, train rides, playing in the park in Grindelwald, doing the chocolate making class, and getting to see his aunt for a few days.",1070,637,1741475656.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1j6tqsn/i_just_took_my_first_big_international_vacation/,Matt8992
Got myself into a predicament in Dubai Airport,"Currently sitting at Dubai with my girlfriend about to board our flight back home to Sydney. We’ve just finished up an awesome 2 month trip around Europe, ending the last week in Amsterdam. We of course got amongst the coffee shops in amsterdam and had a few joints here and there and I forgot that I stored one in my backpack. When I ‘double checked’ my back pack before heading to the airport, i didn’t find the joint as I didn’t even realise I had one in there, as I thought I must have smoked it. Low and behold, we go through security at Dubai, which we were planning on a hop on hop off tour as we had a 15 hour layover, and the security guard pulls out none other than the joint i had forgotten was in there. No good. Spent most of the day getting finger printed, questioned and searched to the point I’m now being deported and never allowed back in the UAE. If this was 2 years ago I would be locked up for 4 years minimum, so I consider myself lucky. This goes for anyone buying weed or any other substance that may be legal where you buy it, do NOT store them in a difficult-to-find pocket in your backpack and forget about it. And before I get flamed saying this was just stupid, I already know, I’ve heard it all day.      EDIT: I would just like to clarify for the people accusing me of ignorance about taking weed to a country that it’s not allowed. I didn’t do it intentionally and I never would. I put this joint in my bag at the start of the week in amsterdam. I had even bought more joints throughout the week as I thought I didn’t have any left, because I forgot about the one in my bag. I may be stupid for forgetting it, but I’m not a complete asshole with a lack of respect on laws of other countries. It was an honest mistake, which I have paid for. I do not need people telling me “next time just don’t do that.” No shit.

Amsterdam Food Scene?,"
Hey everyone! 

My friends and I (a group of 3 ladies) will be visiting Amsterdam in few days from Paris, and we’re super excited to explore the food scene there. We're into pretty much everything — local Dutch specialties, hidden gems, cool cafes, street food, Asian food and even trendy spots if they’re worth it.

We’d love any recommendations for:

• Must-try local dishes or snacks (stroopwafels, herring, etc?)

• Affordable eats or casual spots you love

• A great brunch or breakfast place

We’re staying fairly central but don’t mind hopping on a tram to check out something awesome.

Cities to visit near Amsterdam? ,"Planning a trip to Amsterdam this October. From what I’ve read, we should only plan to spend 3 full days in Amsterdam. We were hoping to make this a week long trip (7 nights) and are trying to decide what city to visit in addition to Amsterdam.

Amsterdam Centraal,"Easily the worst major train station l've ever had the misfortune of visiting in terms of ease to navigate.

Beautiful station in a beautiful city, plenty of shops etc on the concourse, but not a single member of train staff ANYWHERE.

Certain trains need certain tickets, some you can tap in and out with Apple Pay, the platforms are awfully sign posted, and when you finally find a staff member after 20 minutes, they can't answer your question correctly.

If you are a first time user of this station here are a few tips:
- DO NOT use the ticket machines if you can avoid it, go to the ticket kiosk and speak to a human
- Allow an extra 20 mins onto your journey to navigate your way round.

I've spent 2,5 out of 3 hours walking from A to B, queuing and then walking some more to C to D. I never stood in so many queues in my entire life! Even the restrooms had queues because some of them were out of order. Forget about unwinding and enjoying a coffee before departure. By the time I finally got to my gate, it was boarding time.

Is 6.5 hours a long enough layover to leave Schiphol Airport and have lunch in Amsterdam?,"I am headed to Thailand via NYC and I land at 10:30am in Amsterdam and my flight is not until 5pm so I have 6.5 total hours. I am not planning on checking any bags (not that it would matter as it's a layover). I know there are trains that take you right to the center in 20-30 minutes. This is for this weekend so the weather will be pleasant and sunny and about 61 degrees which is perfect for lunch on the water. I was fortunate enough to book business class as I used my points and it's the first time I ever will fly fancy which includes access to the lounge. So it would be tempted to just relax. I have been to Amsterdam a couple of times so it's not like it's my only chance to see it, but I figured why not enjoy a lunch as I am packing lightly and won't have many bags with me. I think there's also a locker at the airport.

Do you think it would be too hectic? I assume I'd want to get back to the Airport by 2:30pm (2.5 hours before my flight) if I have no bags to check? Assuming I get to the city by 11:30-12....it looks like I'd have about 2-2.5 hours.

"Lisbon, Lyon, or Amsterdam? Two day travel recommendations","Hello!

I am going to be in Europe for work next week and will have two days on the end of my trip in which I can travel. The options above are the ones I have landed on. 

A bit more context: I am a late 20s American male that will be traveling alone. I have been to Europe before, living in Copenhagen for 6 months. While I lived there I visited Paris, Florence, London, Bologna, Venice, Berlin, Hamburg, Oslo, and Bergen. Additionally, I will be going to southern Italy this year in September. I do not speak any European languages beside Italian (English is my native language). 

What I am looking for, in order of importance:
- Food/wine/cocktails
- Solo travel friendly 
- City that I would not necessarily go to for a dedicated trip across the pond 
- Walkable city/good public transport 
- Beautiful scenery
- Affordable
- English friendly

I am down for mostly anything, so if you have any suggestions outside of Lisbon, Lyon, and Amsterdam, I am all ears! I am open to anywhere in Europe, but I’m looking for a direct flight in and then an easy flight back to the US. 

Thanks in advance!

Rather than a sightseeing focused trip (I've already done plenty of that with family in Germany, Italy, Greece, France, and Belgium). Really open to anything and everything. It doesn't necessarily have to be a new destination—I’d happily revisit somewhere if it means connecting with like-minded people.

I then return back to Bangkok via Schipol airport on the return leg. For reference I’m a UK passport holder. 

I’ve only ever done this route via CDG once before and my experience wasn’t great. I landed at 8pm and then was told to go through security onto my next gate as my luggage was already being sent through to the next plane, due to take off at 9.20pm. Great, except none of the boards had my flight information on it, finding out where the hell I was even meant to be was a nightmare and a strike of security staff meant massive queues. I almost missed my flight and ended up lucking out only because a storm delayed the departure by 30min. Even then, I had to run.

I’m sort of dreading this part as due to my previous experience, I’m now wondering if this is going to be a repeat of the same thing again. Am I actually going to have enough time with 2hrs between flights? 

Also, on the return leg I fly out to Schipol and land at 8.30pm. My flight onwards isn’t until the next day, at 5.15pm so I’m wondering if it would be easier to simply wait it out in Schipol or if there’s anything worth doing in the late evening and for a single morning in Amsterdam itself before heading back to the airport for that flight in the early afternoon?

**📍Paris (2 nights)**

* Arriving from CDG, staying near Gare de l’Est
* Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, bakery hopping (La Maison Rose, Du Pain et des Idées, Carette)
* Walking Champs-Élysées, grabbing dinner near Saint-Émilion
* Not doing Louvre or Versailles — keeping it scenic and food-focused

**📍Strasbourg (3 nights)**

* Day trip to Colmar (return by train)
* Petite France, Place Kléber, local winstubs, cathedral
* Trying local bakeries and chill walks around the riverside
* Staying near the station

**📍Lyon (3 nights)**

* Bouchon dinner (Les Lyonnais), and another at Carmelo
* May do the 2-hour e-bike tour if the weather’s nice
* Exploring Vieux Lyon, traboules, Parc de la Tête d’Or, and checking out Presqu’île
* Staying fairly central

**📍Nice (3 nights)**

* Promenade des Anglais, flower market, beach strolls
* One day trip to Eze, plus a walk up to the Jardin Exotique
* Food will be light and local — socca, seafood, pastries

**📍Amsterdam (4 nights)**

* Exploring the city by tram and foot
* Anne Frank House, Keukenhof, and a half-day out to Zaandam + Zaanse Schans
* Cafés like Lanskroon, Fabel Friet, Winkel 43

* Train (€140, \~12 hours, 1 transfer) - Trains run on green energy!
* Bus (€110, \~24 hours, no transfers) - Not really a great option.

Need Help Choosing: London + Scotland vs. Italy + Amsterdam (July 2025 Trip),"
Hi Reddit fam! 

My husband and I are planning our summer vacation for the first half of July 2025, and we’re down to two very different but amazing options — 

London + Scotland or Italy + Amsterdam. 
We’d love your help choosing!

About us:
	•	We’re a couple in our early 30s, no kids.
	•	We’re not really into history or museums.
	•	We love exploring cities, unique experiences, gorgeous scenery, great local food, and an amazing nightlife scene.
	•	Not huge fans of over-touristy or overly chaotic places.
	•	We loved places like Paris, Nice, Bodrum, Cappadocia, Ibiza (for parties) and found Antalya and Barcelona a bit too touristy or generic.

Our biggest priorities:
	•	Weather (we want to enjoy being outside!)
	•	Crowd levels
	•	Daily vibe and energy
	•	Good food and drinks
	•	Scenery and unique experiences

⸻

Option A: London + Scotland (14 days)
	•	Day 1–3: Explore London

	•	Day 4: Day trip to Thorpe Park 

	•	Day 5: More time in London

	•	Day 6: Day trip to Bath 

	•	Day 7: Day trip to Brighton 

	•	Day 8–10: Edinburgh
	•	Day 11: Day trip to the Trossachs National Park
	•	Day 12–13: Back to London for final days

	•	Day 14: Fly home

⸻

Option B: Italy + Amsterdam (13–14 days)
	•	Day 1–3: Amsterdam

	•	Day 4–6: Rome

	•	Day 7–9: Amalfi Coast (base in Sorrento)

	•	Day 10–12: Florence

	•	Day 13: Fly home

(We can extend this by a day or two if needed)

⸻

What would you choose?
	•	Which trip sounds like a better fit for our style?
	•	Is the Italy summer heat/crowds really that bad? Also because of the Jublee 
	•	Would London + Scotland be as exciting and memorable?

Would love to hear thoughts, advice, and any experience-based recommendations.

TIA!

Seeking input: Amsterdam to Luxembourg,"Hello! In August, I have one week (7 nights) to get from Amsterdam to Luxembourg solo. I land in Amsterdam on a Tuesday around 2pm and fly out of Luxembourg the next Tuesday around 11:30am.   
(I found a really good deal on flights with a long enough layover in Heathrow so grabbed it while I could!).

I'd definitely like to spend a few days in Amsterdam and to check out Delft, Trier, and Luxembourg, but other than that it is up in the air! I am also curious about where would be best to be on Sunday since it sounds like shops will be closed in Luxembourg and nearby cities (Metz, Trier, etc).

I'm also thinking about, but not set on:  
Metz  
Mechelen  
Ghent or Bruges (I think one or the other would be fine)  
Lille (if going to Ghent/Bruges)  
Cologne (if going through Germany)  
Vianden Castle (could be a good way to avoid the Sunday closures in town)

About me, I'm a big architecture and urbanism fan (arch. student here), love a nice overlook (both cities and landscapes), and prefer to learn about cities by exploring rather than just going to museums. I also love to hike but was thinking to just avoid it so that I can pack lighter.

Where to stay in Amsterdam?,"My husband and I are planning a trip to Europe and Amsterdam is one of the stops.  We arrive on March 27 and are planning on staying in Amsterdam for 5 or 6 nights (we will do a day trip or two while in Amsterdam).

Note that **we do not drive** so we would be walking and taking public transit (I'd like to avoid spending a fortune on cabs/Ubers).  While the further out from the city center the cheaper it is, in general, I don't want to waste an entire morning getting from our hotel to where we are going -- convenience is important!

Is this consistent with **ALL** schengen to non-schengen layovers, doesn't matter the specific cities?

I am asking this because if I were to purchase duty-free liquids @ Madrid airport, then I can't go through secure checks again (without throwing those purchases away) since I don't have a checked bag to put these liquids in.",0,8,1748618897.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kz74er/amsterdam_airport_ams_schengen_to_nonschengen/,bookup1
Amsterdam - what a place!,"Just spent two days in Amsterdam. Holy hell, what a place.


It's kind of incredible how a city so generally quiet can be so chaotic. The pace of life there is 148bpm. Because of how small the pedestrian walkways are (if you're not walking through a bike street like a dumbass), there's like, no stopping/standing allowed. You're 100% in the way, and people will look at you like it.


There's stimulation everywhere, on one hand, the bikes keep the noise down and are conducive to easier/more flexible egress around town. But they're also more unpredictable. They pop out of nowhere, and because they're smaller they don't trigger your ""oh shit"" sense like a car would, so you see non-observant and overstimulated tourists getting hit by them. (the locals have figured it out, obv, its usually tourist hitting tourist). I like it better than what you see in England/USA, but still. The sheer density of everything (the super narrow buildings) make you feel like you're covering huge ground in mere steps, my American sense of ""this block, that block"" were confused. Also, the smell. That whole city center smells like piss. Not overwhelmingly so, but it's ever present. It feels as if you go from cloud of tobacco smoke to cloud of cannabis smoke every 10 feet, with the piss smell in between. Im still trying to pin fown exactly why, but I cannot get over how overstimulated I was, I've never experienced this even in NYC or Paris to this degree. The heartbeat of this place is just SOOO fast. However, this doesn't apply as much outside the inner rungs of the ""circle"" of canals. Im more speaking to walking around the true city center. It was VERY peaceful otherwise, and I'm super excited to visit smaller Dutch towns in the future.


The coffeeshops are the only refuge from this. It just smells like weed for one, they keep the music at a lower tempo (cliche psychedelic rock, i found this very grounding). The lights are dimmer. People SPEAK slower (obv the weed but I think there's more to it). If you're lucky, a local will sit down next to you and chat with you (Amsterdam locals I met were VERY nice, esp for big city people). I can actually form a thought, this is where I would plan my days other than the hostel. You have two choices, weed shop + coffee or coffee shop + weed. Go with the latter. I WISH Seattle had these. Coffee, cannabis, and good vibes is what we do best.


Your parks are AWESOME! I loved Vondelpark, ate some truffles and layed out in the grass and explored the park all early afternoon. I love how the clouds on a sunny day will move fast in a line across the sky with the trade winds as opposed to low-hanging gloom you see in the british isles or coastal Washington. The air quality wasn't great (not bad either), but overall I like that it feels considerably less muggy than up north even when it's ""wet"". It's obv a maritime climate but there's clearly some continental influence as well. The park was super nice, bike paths throughout, nice little alcoves in the trees to discover. Easy access to water/pisser. People minded their business, the only thing that was even a little annoying were the massive groups of Brazillians with party speakers kicking a ball around. Music was good though, so I didn't really mind. It was suprisingly clean, even the more hidden areas only had trash that looked fairly new. Vibes were again, great.


Music was GREAT, but I love techno so that helps. The Melkweg venue was super cool. Went on the Tuesday night show they have and had a great time. It was touristy, but overall a great party with lots of cool people to be found. I got the scoop from someone I met there about a better place to party the next night, and ended up having a great time there too. Dont remember seeing a venue name advertised, was pretty non-descript but the vibes were immaculate. Felt very intimate, like a large house party. Less ""bros"" for sure, very genuine people. Wish I spoke the language, lol.


Food was very okay. I think I just had bad luck. Had some bad (diarrhea inducing) shwarma day 1, kind of ruined the night but recovered by next day. Had some ""Indian"" food before that was absolutely disgusting. No spice, tasted more sweet than anything else. They called it Korma. It was not. Tried one if the Argentine steakhouses, and that was great! 35 euro for a 400g filet and a Campari cocktail. Both were excellent, reminded me of being back with my family in Texas. As far as Dutch food I tried, your BREAD is outstanding, and thus, the sandwiches. Pastries/sweets shops when I found the good ones were a highlight of the whole trip. The one where you load up an unrolled waffle crepe with strawberries, caramel, and whipped cream made my fat american heart smile. On that note, had a burger that was absolutely incredible as well. It was the bread/bun that made it. Ive heard you have good Indonesian but I guess I didn't walk by any.


Museums punched above their weight. Anne Frank museum was very well done. Van Gogh museum I expected more, but it was still cool if you already had it on your list. Rijksmuseum was my favorite. You can't really beat the venue on that one, the architecture itself is an exhibit. The architecture of the city in general though, is very impressive. To my tastes, world class even.


One sour note that sort of bothered me. The criminal element that oh so clearly pervades the smart shops. Same goes for some of the more ""buy your shit and gtfo"" coffeeshops. Every smart shop I personally went into other than the very nice lady at the Alien Visitors felt like they were Albanian mafia owned fronts. You're watched like a HAWK when you go in, they will push product on you without explaining what it is, they sell gimmicky shit to fleece tourists, they balk when you ask about quality controls (yes i know it's illegal but still). Like they had maybe 1g tubes of poppy straw that they were saying ""makes you feel like you're on the good shit!"" when added to a joint for example. Super slimy. These were the ones that had the red mario shroom as their logo. They rush you in (they've got a ""scary"" looking guy guarding the door), push product that ranges from 100% bunk to irresponsibly powerful with no explanation of effects other than a QR code and the promise of ""itl get ya fucked up!"", then they rush you out. Very unfriendly, very sketchy. It felt exactly like picking up hard drugs off the street. I ended up leaving without buying anything but a 5 euro one hitter I needed, I got an eye roll the minute he realized i wasn't dropping an absurd amount on psychedelics I don't want/need. While I was waiting I watched him cojole a group of young people into buying 20g+ (psilocybe) truffles each even though they specifically said they ""dont want a real mushroom trip"" just an amphetamine type buzz. That's exactly how you ruin people's night and create a problem that makes all users of the medicine look terrible and threaten the continued policy of tolerance. That said, Alien Visitors was a great experience. The lady who runs the place did the opposite of the above. Very calm environment. No sales tacticts. She explained to me the fact these truffles are generally fresh, so they're less potent gram for gram. Each strain she explained the relative potency and equivocated to what I told her I had experience with (psilocybe mushroom fruiting bodies). I went with the pink one, she said it was newer strain and felt very close to 2g of dry shrooms, but with a faster come up and shorter experience, similar to a lemon tek. I found this to be right on the nose. She said the ""Natures Finest"" (strongest ones) were like 3g lemon tek. The weakest ones were like 1g she said (all 15g packs). She said the strains are mostly marketing but some are generally stronger than others but they're all psilocybin trips basically. She showed me all her locally blown glass, even though I had no intention of buying. Gave me advice on where to go/what to do while tripping in Amsterdam. Even invited me to come back the next day and tell her how it went! Never once did I feel pressured to buy. I'm sure if I had tried anything untoward I would've had a gangster beating my ass in a second, but she actually seemed to do her best to make her space feel relaxed and genuine. I appreciate that.


My favorite activity all trip though, was biking ALL around town on a rental bike. Black Bike gave me a discount via my hostel, they were great! Answered all my questions on local laws and driving customs. Wow, what an experience! It took all day but I think I saw everything in a 20km radius of the center! What an incredible aesthetic this city has! From the buildings to the canals to the parks, there's beauty everywhere. Bikes are the main form of traffic in the city center, and are taken seriously! It's expected you are a carry competent rider, any slight  momentary hiccup in balance will be met with eye rolls, even if you're holding your lane! Which makes sense, you can get a lot of people hurt just like in a car if you cause an accident! For the tourist, it's an excellent class in adaptability and ability to quickly conform to the very different road culture. Yield to the biggest object, hold your lane, and always use your bell to alert to pedestrians your presence! Stay to right of the lane so faster bikes can pass, don't hog the whole lane! The roads/lanes are NOT marked clearly like in the US, so i find best thing for me was to closely follow someone going the same way as me and copy them. This was all well and good until I got to what looked like an 8 way intersection, with NO light, NO signs, and basically NO lanes painted. It was a free for all of bikes, trams, and trucks. There was a method to the madness im sure, but I didnt get it! I followed the bike in front of me white knuckling the whole way. I managed to survive having caused no accidents, it all just kind of flowed perfectly somehow. Ive found you'll be in step with the locals if you stop trying to calculate every move and just do the intuitive thing your senses want you to do . Just be predictable!


I found the last note to be true all throughout my time there, to an exceptional degree. I really enjoyed that! I suppose that tracks with everything else I wrote here, the Amsterdammers are masters of controlled chaos (ie they're SENSIBLE). you'll notice foot traffic in the city center tends to ""pull you"" one way or the other, and you'll become one with the ""flow"" of the city. It appears to be a response (adaptation) to the relative chaos, making it possible to navigate. I thought far more clearly walking with the flow of foot traffic than standing still. Super weird, but cool! Ive never been anywhere that wasn't a music festival  where massive crowds FLOW that smoothly.


Im not a big shopper but I found a few places that I liked! Particularly ones owned and operated by a local artist. There was a clothing store/designer called ""Like Charlie"" that sells super cool shirts/hoodies/pullovers that the owner/operator designs, he said he's trying to bring awareness to mental health issues and donates 10% of revenue to charity. He was very personable and passionate about his designs and mission, I had to support. Seemed like a really great guy and the conversation left me feeling great! Small thing, but the good vibes had me in a good mood all day!


All in all, one of my favorite trips ever. I just found the place to be delightful, and the people to be more than hospitable. I can't wait to come back to Holland! Hopefully next time I can explore some smaller cities, I loved the Dutch culture I experienced, but Amsterdam being a large international city this culture wasn't as overtly visible as I'm sure it is in other cities.

Vienna or Amsterdam as a female solo traveler (in July)?,"Hi! I’m a uni student who’s planning on solo traveling next summer - early July to be specific. 

I would like to visit Vienna or Amsterdam but can’t decide… I need to fly on Lufthansa so it would be Munich-Vienna or Frankfurt-Amsterdam. 

(I’ve been to Munich and Frankfurt and will only spend a day or two so both doesn’t really matter)

I’ve been to Vienna (and other cities in Austria) as well but it was when I was younger, and I think the familiarity would help me on my first ever solo trip. 

I’ve never been to Netherlands, so it would be nice to have a new experience. Plus I will visit Rotterdam as well if I choose this. 

Things I have to consider:

Accommodation - I want clean and safe hotel. Novotel or other 4 star business hotels. But I heard Amsterdam is more expensive than Vienna…

Racism & Overall Safety - I’m an Asian woman so… I never had unpleasant experience in any part of Austria but was wondering about Amsterdam. 

Sightseeing - My visit will be about a week long and won’t move around the country so it would be nice if the city is filled with tourist attractions.

They often get labeled as too touristy, too crowded, unsafe, inauthentic, boring, etc. I don’t understand how people can get bored in a city with millions of people and ton’s of attractions, but everyone’s entitled to their opinion so I respect that. 

So what’s a city you visited that gets constant hate but you ended up loving? I’ll start. This year, I visited Lima Peru, Santiago Chile, and Brussels. These 3 cities constantly get shit on for being bland but I loved each one. Lima has some of the best food you will ever eat, and the nightlife is underrated. Santiago also has solid nightlife even tho it always gets labeled as boring. I also loved how modern Santiago looked and the close proximity to nature. Brussels is probably the city I’ve heard people complain about the most of the 3. But then I get there and it’s a city full of great beer, great chocolate/waffles, and amazing architecture. I could never be disappointed 😂",457,937,1735294908.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hnc1b6/which_capital_city_gets_a_lot_of_hate_that_you/,Lem__Mann7
How can I justify spending £1.2k on a 3 night stay in Amsterdam for a suite?,"Hello! It's my boyfriends birthday soon and we are going to Amsterdam for 3 nights, so I'd like to surprise him with a nice hotel. I found this Hotel Jakarta that has great reviews. We are not rich, working class but we have a bit saved up for holidays (this is not out of our emergency savings).

It includes breakfast and it is a suite (looks beautiful).  I'm so close to paying for the £1.2k suit for 3 nights (beginning of June) but I'm getting a gut feeling not to do it and choose the room below instead for £750-800.

How do you justify these large purchases?

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the response, was not expecting this many comments so I really appreciate the advice. I have decided to book the room below (still with a lovely view, a balcony and a bath) for £750. So will spend the rest on activities and treat him to a nice meal :)",0,62,1714646934.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cickbq/how_can_i_justify_spending_12k_on_a_3_night_stay/,randyracoon
How to claim VAT tax refund if leaving via Amsterdam Centraal?,"I’m currently in Munich and my last stop in EU would be Amsterdam. Unfortunately, I’ve seen lots of post regarding how there is no custom officers at Amsterdam Centraal to get a tax refund stamp. Hence, I was just wondering if anyone knows if the situation is still the same? Or can I get my tax refund form validated at the Amsterdam airport instead by providing my Eurostar train ticket? Or can I get my form validated at Munich airport instead?",0,2,1750537625.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lh5zov/how_to_claim_vat_tax_refund_if_leaving_via/,krispyk00kie
Flying through Amsterdam to Barcelona with short layover,"Hoping to make the most of my short 4.5h layover by walking through the sequence of events here and seeing if I'm missing anything. Thanks for any advice!

Coming from Canada and will arrive in Schiphol airport (mid morning, mid week). I will only have carry on. 
1. Arrive in one of the non Schengen gates. 
2. Go through security and passport control. I'm flying business class and I hear there is a priority lane? Can anyone confirm?
3. Once I'm in Schengen area of airport, I can just leave to go on the train bound for Amsterdam Centraal station, right? 
4. I believe the train is pretty frequent, and is about 20 min.

I'll spend about an hour downtown. Just to see the canals, get a couple souvenirs for the kids. Hopefully my Jetpac eSIM will actually work. Then back to airport for flight to Spain.
1. Take train from Centraal to airport. 
2. I'll have electrically checked in already.
3. I have a security appointment for a bit over and hour before departure. 
4. Otherwise, is there a priority lane and can business class passengers use it? In general does Nexus matter in the EU? 
5. Go through security, get to gate in Schengen area of airport. 
6. Depart.

Any thoughts? Am I crazy to try to leave the airport? My alternative is to sit in the lounge but I hear they're kinda crowded anyway.

EDIT: Thanks all for the advice and reality checks! I'll stay in the airport and hang out. Bad news: my flight back home on Saturday has only a 1hr connection at Schiphol, going from Schengen to non Schengen. No idea why the travel agent booked such a tight connection. Will see if they can move it. Thanks!",6,39,1726440810.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fhpmko/flying_through_amsterdam_to_barcelona_with_short/,Gazorninplat6
VAT refund when shopping in Paris but short layover in Amsterdam before returning to the US,"I’d like to share my experience with the VAT refund process during a layover in Amsterdam in February 2025. This was my first time going through the VAT process at AMS, and also my first time doing one during a layover. Initially, I was super stressed because there was limited information about doing VAT refunds during a layover at AMS. However, now that it’s done, I can say it wasn’t as difficult as I thought—it just requires a little planning. A three-hour layover at AMS gave me more than enough time to complete everything for the VAT refund but I may have been lucky due to the time of day (morning) and the season (off-peak/winter). I hope my experience helps others who find themselves in a similar situation.

Part 1- Shopping and obtaining VAT forms: 
I went shopping in Paris.  For each qualifying purchase, I asked for VAT/detaxe forms and presented my physical passport to the cashier at checkout. I asked for my refund to be sent to my credit card (as opposed to cash- this is just personal preference).  One tip: before you leave the store, check the VAT forms to make sure they typed your information correctly.  I had two store associates misspell my name and one lady put the wrong passport number.  Unfortunately for me, I did not realize the errors until after I left.  At high end boutiques, they ask you to review your information on the VAT forms to ensure it is correct.  But this isn’t the case at all stores. I can’t recommend enough that you check all forms for accuracy before you leave the store. Also, if possible, ask for an envelope because depending on your situation you may need one (more below).  

A note about shopping at Galeries Lafayette Haussmann: For my Louis Vuitton and Jimmy Fairly purchases, the vendors provided me with VAT/detaxe forms directly. However, for clothing purchases in the women’s fashion section, I had to take my receipts to the VAT/detaxe area on the first floor of the main store, across from the Saint Laurent boutique. Here, in the VAT/detaxe area, you scan your receipts, and the kiosk generates the VAT/detaxe forms for you. These are the forms you'll need to take to the airport for stamping.

Part 2- Packing for Return Trip Home:
When doing a VAT refund during a layover (airside aka on the side after security), all the items for which you want to receive a VAT refund must be unused/unworn and must be with you in your carry-on. This is because the customs officers may inspect your purchased items before stamping your forms. In AMS, there was a sign that basically said, “no goods, no stamp”.

Part 3- Getting VAT Forms Stamped at AMS:
Each VAT form from your shopping trip must be stamped in the last EU country you visit before leaving the EU—this includes short layovers, so be sure to plan your flight accordingly when booking! Since I had a layover in Amsterdam before my flight back to the US, my VAT forms had to be stamped at AMS (and not Paris CDG where I did the shopping).   

On the day of my departure from Europe, I flew from Paris CDG to Amsterdam AMS, where I had a three-hour layover. Upon landing at AMS, I went through passport control, which had two lines: one on the left for certain passport holders, such as US citizens, and a much longer line on the right for everyone else. I joined the US passport line and went through an automated lane, where I scanned my passport and had my photo taken. After passing through the automated lane, I handed my passport to an officer, who stamped it. The entire passport control process took only about five minutes for me.

Once out of this passport control area, I found myself in the Lounge 2 area of the airport (in America we might call it Terminal instead of Lounge).  I had to walk about 15 minutes to get to Lounge 3.  I was able to get there without passing through security- it’s all open and connected but requires a bit of walking. I mention this only because on my way to Paris, I also had a layover at AMS but had to go through security between Lounges and it took over an hour.  Anyways, once in the Lounge 3 area of the airport, look for Tony’s Chocolate or Victoria’s Secret.  On the opposite side of these stores, you will see a shop called, “The Fashion Gallery.” To the left of this shop is a gray sign that says “Tax free validation/refund.  Step 1: get a stamp.” When I arrived around 10AM, no one was in line.  I walked right up to the window and the customs officer asked, “DO YOU HAVE YOUR GOODS???” I replied “yes” and he asked me for my VAT forms.  He stamped all the forms without inspecting my “goods” or saying another word. I then took pictures of all stamped VAT forms for my record.

Part 4- Submitting Your Stamped VAT Forms:
The next step differs based on your VAT operator. On each VAT form, check the top right-hand side under “Identification” to verify the “Operateur de Detaxe”.  This is the company that will handle your refund (i.e. Global Blue or SolPay). This might be obvious to some but it was confusing for me: The operator (i.e. Global Blue or SolPay) can be a 3rd party company and can be different from the store where you bought your items (i.e. Louis Vuitton).  Alternatively, the operator could be the same company as where your purchased your items (i.e. Galeries Lafayette Haussmann). 

If your VAT operator is Global Blue: Literally right next door to where you got your custom stamp, mere feet away, is the Global Blue window. The person at the Global Blue window took my stamped Global Blue VAT forms.  He suggested I download the Global Blue app to track my progress/status. If this window is closed (i.e. you’re transiting through AMS outside of their business hours), there is a Global Blue mailbox near the window.  You can put your stamped forms in the envelope and stick it into the Global Blue mailbox. This is when the envelope comes in handy so ask for an envelope at the store.

If your VAT operator is Galeries Lafayette Haussmann: Someone said the bookstores in AMS will mail my postage-free envelope containing my stamped VAT form.  But I went to two bookstores in the airport and both of them told me they only mail out postcards, nothing else. I didn’t know what else to do so I brought my stamped VAT forms home to the US and mailed them from the US using the correct postage for mailing a letter to France.

If your VAT operator is SolPay: There are no mailboxes for SolPay at AMS. Once I got home to the US, I mailed my stamped VAT form to them using my own envelope with the correct postage for mailing a letter to France. 

If your VAT operator is someone else not listed above: in the vicinity of the customs stamp line and Global Blue window, there were two other silver mailboxes. I forget which companies but if your VAT operator is one of those companies you can drop off your stamped VAT forms in the corresponding mailboxes. Otherwise, you’ll probably have to do what I did, which is to bring your stamped VAT forms home and mail them from your home country.

Part 5: Wait for Refund
Voila! Now, it’s a waiting game for my refund back to my credit card


Update- it’s been 2.5 weeks since forms submitted/mailed: 
GlobalBlue refund: It took 2 weeks for the app to update the status from “custom stamp needed” to “tax free form received.” And then a few days later I received my refunds back to my credit card. 

Galeries Lafayette refund: It took 1.5 weeks for the status online to show customs validation received (meaning they received the stamped form I mailed from the US, yay!).  It now shows that my refund is processing and the website says it takes 3-5 weeks from the date of receiving forms for refund. Still waiting on refund. 

SolPay: We’re two weeks out and the website says “TAX-FREE FORM VALIDATED Our company refund delay policy is 4 weeks after customs validation. We will proceed to your tax refund very soon.” I’m assuming this means they received the stamped form that I mailed from the US.  My only concern with this refund is that the sales associate typed the wrong name AND wrong passport number so I’m not certain I’ll get this refund. Still waiting on refund.

Boat bike tour from Amsterdam to Bruges for a non-rider,"Hi all,

We're booked on a 7 night boat bike tour from Amsterdam to Bruges in a little while.  There's 4 of us - 3 adults and my 13 year old daughter, who unfortunately is not a confident rider at all (very mild case of cerebral palsy).  There is the option of one of us to stay on the boat each day instead of riding but I'm trying to find out what other options there are. 

Has anybody been on this trip that can recommend any alternatives? I've asked about a tandem bike or a 3-wheeled bike/tricycle and they don't offer those. The other things I've thought of so far are somehow getting an e-scooter or one of those toddler trailers (if she could squash in!). Training wheels?

Small tips about taking the train between Amsterdam and Berlin,"I just boarded the direct train (Intercity Berlijn) from Amsterdam to Berlin, which I assume is a popular route for European tourists but most of the information on the official operator's website (NS) and even some information at the train station was completely wrong. So here's my experience in case it helps someone:

1. 1st class will be on 1 end of the train, but at Berlin Hauptbahnhof station, the train map was completely reversed. To make matters worse, there is actually no way to get between 2nd class and 1st class cars on this train, so literally all 1st class passengers were sprinting from 1 end of the (very crowded) platform to the other end to get onto the train (also the train arrived at 14:05 with scheduled departure of 14:10 so there was real risk you could miss the train if you didn't run). I would actually suggest standing in the middle of the platform and then you can avoid this rush either way.
2. If you book this particular train online, you can request a seat reservation but you can't select the seat, or even request a window / aisle. I strongly suggest calling the reservation hotline instead to request a specific seat.
3. For 1st class specifically, on the NS website, it said very clearly that 1st class seats only have power outlets on the window. This is false, actually there are power outlets under every seat - but only the window and middle seats have access to a desk. If you are planning to do work / use your laptop (which I assume many people are doing on this nearly 6 hour train ride) then you should really try to get the window seat >> middle seat, again which requires calling the NS phone number in advance.
4. This only changed a few months ago so I can't blame the internet for being wrong, but there is no longer a dining car on this train, just a snack cart.
5. This is just personal opinion but unlike many other intercity trains, this one actually can get quite full (according to another passenger in my compartment who travels this route regularly) and people are sitting on the floor in 2nd class. Keep in mind this is April, not even peak travel season. I would say it's pretty much a necessity to book a seat reservation in 2nd class or just spring for 1st class.",12,8,1745239079.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k4cgww/small_tips_about_taking_the_train_between/,Dry_Row_7523
6am flight home from Amsterdam: would you stay closer to city center or at airport? ,"We are staying in Amsterdam, specifically in the De Pijp area, about a 40 minute walk to central station. Our flight from Amsterdam leaves at 6am, meaning we have to be at the airport around 4am. I’ve read that trams only run in the night from Central station to the airport, and when I map it at 3am, it says it takes about an hour of travel time (because we’d have to get to central station)

If it were you, would you just stay closer to the airport the night before to save yourself that travel time at 3am? There’s also uber and bolt. I just get nervous about availability at 3am. Accommodation is also significantly cheaper by the airport than in the tourist center, obviously. So we’d end up saving money this way too. Or is there an easier way I’m missing?

Frankfurt Airport (FRA) is the worst airport ever,"I posted this in r/TravelHacks some weeks ago about layovers in Frankfurt, and thought it would be interesting to share in this sub about my experience connecting there. But for starters: I never thought, as a traveller, that I could hate an airport so much. 

For starters - remote positions for a 747 is such a dumb idea. Arriving there and a tow truck broke on our assigned gate. Not a great start. Then comes endless walking and confusing signage, coming back to where you started, the same concourse having Schengen and non-Schengen flights. I even exited the security zone by mistake and there were no signs whatsoever about this. 

Then comes very rude and unhelpful staff: security agents speaking German even when you say out loud you do not speak the language. One agent before passport control pretending he wasn’t listening to what I said and acting like I was stupid. I have not seen one single smile or politeness in those people. 

The mice! Right by a Lufthansa lounge, a mouse comes off the wall, grabs a piece of food from the floor and comes back. Or just casually crossing one side of the corridor to the other. Are the mice traps working? Guess not. 

I’ve been to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Madrid, Milan and all of those make sense, have centralised passport/security controls, and helpful personnel. It’s a shame that Lufthansa (which seems to own that place given how many flights they operate) allows this to happen. Not to mention the multiple passport/security checkpoints which allow you to pass them twice. It’s just a massive loophole.

Amsterdam - doors closing before you finish tapping out,"Hi,

Currently in Amsterdam travelling, I bought a GVB card (from app, I have to use the QR code every time) however the readers are a bit slow. Going in is fine because you can get in first then tap in however tapping out is difficult. Tap out on your stop then if you have like 3 people going out, the doors are already closing, doors doesn’t seem to have proximity sensors as well because I’ve been squished by the doors twice for the 2 days I’ve been here. 

On the trams you have a green button to press to open the door but buses don’t. How do I get off quicker? Do you have to tap before your stop? How will they get an accurate distance then? But if I have a GVB card I suppose it’s fine?

Train from Giethoorn to Amsterdam,"Hi everyone! 👋

notes on EWR late may/early june 2025 and amsterdam airport,"Just in case this is helpful to people since I googled to find this info and came across reddit posts!

EWR:

50 minute delay on an international flight leaving around May 20. Partially delayed due to weather, partially due to other planes and the runway issues there right now. Made up maybe 10 minutes in the air. Might have had a connection issue if it weren't for the next flight getting delayed.

On the way back though (around June 1) we had zero delays getting off the plane and into the airport.

Amsterdam airport connections:

My connection was for 1.5 hours, which was a little tight (esp considering EWR was the origin) but I had no better option other than spending another $1k for a direct flight so I took the gamble. I'm glad it all worked out but in retrospect it was tight. We were delayed, and simply walking fast across the airport and getting through border security took half an hour at least. The airport is MASSIVE and I didn't realize that when booking b/c I foolishly thought that if there was no tram taking you to different parts of the airport, it must be ""smaller"" :p

What I did though was opt for a connecting flight that wouldn't be as disruptive if I missed it. Far easier to get another flight from Amsterdam to another major city in Europe when you have all day, than trying to catch another flight to a specific US airport when you're already leaving later in the day.",1,0,1748992391.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1l2qf9o/notes_on_ewr_late_mayearly_june_2025_and/,Sailor_Marzipan

Best day trips out of Amsterdam?,"Hi all!

I’ll be visiting London/Amsterdam this summer. I’ll be spending three nights in London and six in Amsterdam. 

Based on what I’ve read and heard from friends, Amsterdam itself can be experienced in three-ish days and you’ll get the gist (if this is not the case, don’t shoot the messenger, just what I’ve been told). Therefore, I was looking at some day trips out of Amsterdam. The repeated places I’ve seen include:
-The Hauge
-Brussels
-Rotterdam

Are these all places you’d recommend for a day trip? Is there better places you’d suggest? If you had to suggest 3 day trips out of Amsterdam, what are your top 3?

Also, if there’s a day trip place where my boyfriend and myself could rent bikes and bike around would be amazing. I have no idea where to go for this, so if you have any suggestions for that, let me know. As long as we can get there and back by public transport in a day, I’d love to hear it!",30,58,1702444753.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18h9fkv/best_day_trips_out_of_amsterdam/,schrodingerzkatt

London-Paris and Lucerne or Amsterdam or someplace else?,"Hello all I am done with medical training soon and finally have the luxury of funemployment to travel before I start work. 

We are definitely doing London (4-5 nights), Paris (4-5 nights). We are stuck on what other city (maybe 1-2 max) to tack on. Caveat is we’ll have a 6 month old with us. Options:

- originally wanted Rome but Jubilee is happening so I’ll just save it for a full trip to Italy and surrounding areas in the future

- Amsterdam - easy to get to from Paris, though I’m just not as excited about it for some reason? Do people really enjoy it? I worry I’ll be underwhelmed coming from London and Paris

- Lucerne Switzerland with 1 day trip to Interlaken: only concern is the logistics may be harder to figure out as it’s not a major city with easy access to everything like London or Paris. But the scenery looks beautiful. I also visited Lake como before and found it beautiful but boring and would have preferred to spend more time in a big city like Venice

If we didn’t have a baby we would consider flying somewhere else like Spain for instance. 

Any recs? Or other cities I shld consider?

Flying from NZ to Amsterdam solo with an 8 month old baby?,"Am I crazy to consider flying to Amsterdam from NZ solo with my 8 month old baby? The flight would be 27 hours with a short layover or 42 hours with an overnight layover.

The original plan was for my Mum mother to fly over with me and baby, if I went on 21st August, to Milan (we are going to Italy for a wedding), but my sister lives in Amsterdam and it would be amazing go a week earlier to stay with her and get free accommodation and another week of travel whilst I'm on maternity leave.

My husband will arrive in Italy on 28th August and will fly back to NZ with me and baby, so the return journey won't be alone.

If I go solo with baby, I'm thinking of considering a Sky Couch on the stretch from NZ to Singapore, doing a longer layover to get some sleep, and then using a bassinet on the second leg to Amsterdam. Or should I skip Amsterdam and fly straight to Italy with my mother?

Mother/Daughter Amsterdam/Brussels trip for 9 days in April?,"Hi everyone :)

As the title says, I (26F) finally got my mom (56) on board to visit Europe for the first time (I have been to Greece & Spain) and I am SO excited. She is very apprehensive as she doesn't like long flights (coming from the US) but after discussing decided to take the leap and book.

We are both very outdoors-y people who love exploring cute towns, being in nature, seeing great historical sights and overall experiencing new things. I absolutely loved Crete and would go back in a heartbeat if I could. When planning our itinerary, I decided that it would be possible to fit a few days in Belgium in the itinerary as well because of the proximity. 

If you have been to both of these places before, **what do you think a good split would be for 9 days? Or any suggestions on other places to go outside of AMS?** Our flight arrives at 1pm the first day and leaves at 4pm on the last day. I was looking at going to Ghent as well as Brussels because they both look amazing but am not totally sure how easy it is to get between all those places in a relatively short time.

Avoiding large bag theft on Eurostar (formerly Thales) train from Paris to Amsterdam idea,"If I need to put my large suitcase in the luggage rack area near the train car entrance, would you say the highest risk is while the train is stopped at a station? I assume that’s the best time for someone to get on, grab a bag, get off and go just before the train departs. 

Between stations, while in motion, presumably it’s lower risk since a thief has nowhere to go? Can I relax a bit ?

Also, considering my suitcase is about 20kg, I hope it’s less of a target of theft. Much harder to grab and go!

If I stand by the doorway near my suitcase in the luggage rack until the train doors close and we begin moving, would that be acceptable? Or would I simply be in the way of everyone.

Some questions about visiting Amsterdam,"Hi all, 

I’ll be flying into AMS on a non-EU passport (but I have a fairly strong passport, and usually have no hassle at EU airports) at the end of Nov. Flight should arrive at 1.30pm. 

I’m planning my itinerary and planned to spend 2 hours for immigration and collecting bags. Then take the train into Amsterdam and check in to our hotel by 4.30pm. Wondering if that’s a reasonable estimate?
Asking as we are trying to make a 5.15pm reservation that is 30min walk away from our hotel.

Edit: thanks for the all responses! We have decided that to go ahead with our plans and fingers crossed that immigrations would be just as quick on that day",1,19,1728949918.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g3ueqk/some_questions_about_visiting_amsterdam/,horsegoneigh12345

Extra time in Amsterdam and...Brussels? (extending 2-3 days),"Hello,

Will be going on an educational trip to Amsterdam, checking out on their agriculture and sustainable efforts.

We'll be splitting at the airport at around 3pm on 5 April, and I'm considering staying for a few more days.

Someone around here suggested a day trip to brussels, and I realise flights out of there are cheaper anyway, so I'm thinking of maybe staying for 2 nights in amsterdam, 1 night in brussels, and then flying out from there.

Here's the thing. I have no idea what to do XD. I usually have an idea of what I'd like to do for most countries, but for these 2 places I'm drawing a blank haha.

So far:

5/4 Sat - 3pm original trip ends. Afternoon - ? Evening - Boat guys?  
6/4 Sun - ?  
7/4 Mon - Morn train to brussels, then?  
8/4 Tues - morning/afternoon Flight out

I'm ok with sight seeing, nature, architecture, museums, views, etc. I'm o-k with touristy places if there's actually a point to it you know? (like night markets in Taiwan... touristy but still essential)

2. Correndon Apartments Amsterdam Schipol Airport (nearby to the airport with decent prices, and with the free airport shuttle lol)

I don't have a ""huge"" budget but I don't mind spending a decent amount, since my flight will mostly be paid with my points.

What was your MOST EXPENSIVE travel mistake?,"I'm curious to know how fellow traveler have mistakenly wasted their money while planning or during the trip. I'll start with my latest stupid mistake so hopefully this will help someone avoid such a costly mistake in the future.

My wife and I recently traveled to Panama from The Netherlands. We are non-EU citizens and our passport is crap so we need a VISA to most countries in the world. However, our EU residence permit gives us VISA-free access to a few countries including Panama. This was one of the main reasons why we decided to visit Panama after checking out a few other destinations and spending MANY hours planning a detailed itinerary for a trip to South Africa which required a VISA that we could not get.

Once we settled on Panama and had an itinerary ready, I proceeded to book accommodations and flights. The flight I chose departs from Frankfurt  and flies into David with layovers in Washington and Panama City. Additionally, I booked a Flix bus to Frankfurt, and a train for the return back home from Frankfurt airport.

The day before our flight around 9 PM, as we were packing and excited for the upcoming couple of weeks, I received an email to check-in for our flight. I decided to do that real quick so I can take a break from packing. While going through the check-in process, I found out that because we are transiting through the US, we should've obtained a TRANSIT US VISA!!! I jumped onto Google to check if that's something I can do real quick by submitting an online form and paying a fee. Nope! You have to apply for an appointment at the consulate and go through the whole VISA process just because you're gonna land in an airport and then run to your gate to catch your next flight :)

Luckily, I had a US VISA that was issued for me because of a work event a few months before. But, my wife does not have a US VISA so she could not take the flight. A couple of hours later, I had booked her a direct flight from Amsterdam into Panama City, an internal flight from PC to David, and a hotel near the airport in PC. Those costs in addition to train fees from/to Schipol Airport (AMS) came at around 2100 EUR (**$2270**).

But hey, we did end up having an amazing trip to Panama! Although we're ""seasoned"" travelers and have been to Central America before, this was the first time we transit through the US. So it was an expensive lesson, but we learned to be VERY thorough when checking entry requirements for our future trips!",629,574,1716552062.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1czj1zd/what_was_your_most_expensive_travel_mistake/,Inevitable-Tailor845

Amsterdam or Edinburgh for a writing trip? ,"I (30/F) live in rural England and want to organise a 3-week stay in a different city this January to finish editing a book I’ve written (and get out of my disruptive household and see if I could take to life elsewhere). I’m used to the cold and darkness so the weather isn’t an issue, and I lived in London for 10 years so am used to city life. Ultimately, I want to be in a place that has plenty of coffee shops I can walk to and write in, a literary scene and a general buzz (somewhere where other creatives live so I can feel like I’m in the middle of the action). I plan to attend gym / yoga classes and walk / explore a lot. 

Which would suit me best? I’ve been to Edinburgh before for weekend trips and found it magical but I’ve never been to Amsterdam. However, I know it’s where Quentin Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction, which inspired me.

Travelling from London to Milan via Amsterdam with a pet on KLM: my experience,"Hi fellow pet guardians!

Figured I'd share my experience on KLM flights (City Hoppers) with a pet, cos let's be honest we all need the information we can get when organizing a trip.

Important note: this is my esperience, not the rule!! Do take everything with a grain of salt. All you need is one member of staff in a bad mood, or someone really strict with rules, for stuff to go south, and you dont want to lose your flight on something dumb like rules.

Do your research and make sure you have plan B and C if you are not sure. FYI, I packed an extra carrier that had the right dimentions just in case they rejected the carrier, which was 4cm out in height.

Onwards to the actual info!



= Flights and Airline =

I flew with KLM, single booking for a double flight cos gods forbid I have a direct one straight to where I'd like to be.

 

= Carriers info =

Main carrier, M size: [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BVJ6HN4Y?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2&th=1)

Plan B carrier, M size: [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09PVF8DY6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)



= Pet info =

4.2kg of cat, 1y and 9 months, dimensions 50cm long head to tail fully stretched out, 25cm tall up to his back, 32 cm up to his head.

 

= Paperwork =

× AHC in Dutch and Italian (the point of entry and the destination- vet wasn't sure so I asked for both. Some charge extra for it, be careful)

× Fit to Fly certification

× Vaccination record

× Microchip certification

 

= Flights =

× Origin: London Heathrow (UK)

I arrived at the airport with Uber Pet. I had 2x suicases, a backpack and a cat, no way I'd take the tube to get there lol

I dropped off the suitcases, they asked me for the KLM paper for my cat, then sent me to security. They scanned my backpack and took my carrier with my cat. I assume they checked weight here, but I didnt see them doing that as I was still waiting for my backpack. They then brought me to a separate room to have the carrier checked. They asked me to take out my cat, cos they need to scan the carrier. So be prepared to hold your pet in your arms cos they dont have temporary carrier for your pet (sigh). Once they are satisfied, you can put your pet back into the carrier and off you go.

× Layover: Amsterdam Schiphol (NL)

Followed transfer route. At passport control they told me to go ahead and get my pet checked at customs. Customs was closed at 6pm lol. I asked another member of security, who checked with their manager, and told to me to just go to my gate as they'd check at customs in the country of arrival. Power walked to my next gate, which was 15 minutes away from my arrival gate. In total it took me around 40 minutes from touching NL ground to my next gate.

× Destination: Milan Linate (IT) 

Once cleared passport control, I went to Customs and both security staff told me there was no need to check my pet. So I exited the airport. I assume they didn’t check because at that point I was travelling EU to EU countries, so in their eyes there was no need to check the paperwork.



= Good to know =

× I've literally stopped anyone that looked even remotely staff to say I had a pet and looked as lost as possible to get help/directions/info out of them. It worked. I think it's due to how cute my cat looks. Weaponize it because it grants your fast line EVERYWHERE: baggage drop off, security, passport control.

× One hour connection in Amsterdam IS TIGHT. I power walked and got to my gate in time, but I was technically allowed to skip customs in this airport AND I made sure I was strategically positioned during my entire journey (booked a seat close to the front exist, stayed close to the bus exist to be the first to get off) to make the entire process as smooth as possible for myself.

× Have your AHC in multiple languages - because you might get asked to go through customs at every airport you land in.

× I strongly recommend getting the right specs for the carrier because the 25cm is LITERALLY the actual maximum height of seat in front of yours on KLM Cityhoppers. My main carrier DID NOT fit under the seat. However, both hostess who checked my seatbelt didn’t bat an eye, they just told me to not take my pet out under any circumstances- which, fair.

 

= TLDR =

All went smoothly, I think they checked the weight but not the carrier's dimension, nobody asked me the paperwork I carefully prepared. In hindsight, I overprepared, but it was worth it. It gave me the confidence and peace of mind to face this journey alone. Make with this what you will :)

 Good luck on your flights and may it be as smooth as mine!",16,1,1740130718.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1iun4wg/travelling_from_london_to_milan_via_amsterdam/,Intrepid_Reaction_17

"Solo travelling through Europe(Italy, Switzerland, Amsterdam) in February next year ","I really need your help and suggestions cause i’m really struggling with my planning right now.

I will be travelling solo in Europe next year in February for around 15 days.
I plan to cover Italy, Switzerland, Netherlands and finally ending in Paris, mostly travelling between the places by train.
And in the following sequence: Italy -> Switzerland -> Amsterdam -> Paris

Here’s my plan for each place:

1. Italy: Rome(3 days), Naples(2 days), Florence(1-2 days if i can fit it in my schedule)

2. Switzerland: 2-3 days(not sure about the itinerary)

3. Amsterdam: 2-3 days

4. Paris: 2 days

Now a few questions, if any one can answer it would be a great help cause i’m really clueless right now how to plan and what to cover and include in my itinerary.

Questions about travel:
1. Is it worth it to take the Eurail Global Pass? The seat reservations on Eurail global pass are really adding to the total cost a lot.

2. Is a Swiss Travel Pass worth it? If yes, should I get 1st class or 2nd class pass?
I plan to take Tirano to Chur Bernina express. Should I get a Swiss Travel pass for this, 1st or 2nd class?

3. Do I need to prebook all my trains for my travel?

----------------------------

Questions about what to explore and stay: 
It would be really helpful if someone can give suggestions about itinerary for each place as well.

1. What all to cover in Rome/Naples/Switzerland given my limited number of days?

2. What activities would I need to prebook in each place given peak season in Switzerland?

3. Also, is there a need to book activities and AirBnb/hostels in advance for Italy?

If anyone can answer some of my questions and give some suggestions, it would be really helpful.

"Best Option for Tree Nut Allergy - Paris, Bruges, or Amsterdam/Rotterdam?","I am taking the family (wife and three kids 10,8, and 5) to England this summer for a few weeks. We will take the Eurostar to mainland for 3-4 days and deciding between Paris, Bruges, or Netherlands in general. 

All are great options for an experience so we don’t have a preference, so the deciding factor is really how easy it will be to navigate with my 8 year old’s tree nut allergy (peanuts are not an issue). 

We have researched and it seems Paris may be a bit easier to navigate and more familiar with allergens, but it is not a slam dunk. I would love to hear feedback from those that have had to navigate an allergy in these spots. This is particularly challenging because an 8 year old can’t just skip eating chocolate or treats while everyone else eats them so we have to find alternatives we can all enjoy together.

Planning to do 3 days in Amsterdam and 3 days in another big city. Debating between Berlin or London. Train from Amsterdam to London is a bit pricier than to Berlin.

Amsterdam or Stockholm - which is better for a relaxing budget weekend trip?,"I live in the UK and I want to go on a weekend trip, possibly in September. I like the idea of going somewhere picturesque and relaxing while being able to soak in the sights, plus eating some nice food.

"Need help planning family trip to Amsterdam, where else to go in Europe?","This July, we're heading to Amsterdam and have ten full days to play with.  Going with two adults and two kids (ages 11 and 13).

The plan is to rent a car and drive into other countries to dip our toes into a few other places if possible!  Thinking definitely Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia area and any other great places we can), but playing with Google Maps it looks like we could go south into Belgium, go to Luxembourg, then north into Germany, and finally back into Amsterdam for our return flight.  The total drive time is listed as only 14 hours so over a 5-7 days, that's very reasonable to me.  

What do you think?  For travel goals, we want to see great interesting things, it's our kids' first dip into Europe and they ought to see the beautiful old cobblestone streets, amazing castle(s), any super important must-see sites, you get the idea.

I know nothing about this part of the world, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you so much in advance.",1,4,1737477246.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i6mn9l/need_help_planning_family_trip_to_amsterdam_where/,NoYoureACatLady
Is there any area in or near Amsterdam where you'd avoid staying?,"Amsterdam, I hear, is a very safe place in general.  Safer than where I live, actually.  But if I want a quiet neighborhood to sleep in at night, away from nightclubs and bars (in other words a boring neighborhood), what areas should I avoid?

What city/country was badmouthed to you before you went but you were pleasantly surprised by?,"Mine are Glasgow, Scotland and Paris, France.

Any time I heard someone mentioned Glasgow it was always that it was a bit rough around the edges, not impressive, and a place you only need a day or two in. We found it so fun, artsy, amazing food, and the area we were in (West End) was so full of gorgeous nature. A place I felt I could live in! 

Paris, we were told that it all smelled like pee, was dirty, you were gonna get mugged/harassed, etc. We found it perfectly pleasant, didn’t smell bad, great attractions, and have some of the fondest memories from the city!",860,921,1687725675.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/14iwoxo/what_citycountry_was_badmouthed_to_you_before_you/,morfoodie
AVOID to  rent a van from Indie campers Amsterdam,"**TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE, - THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ANYTHING OR ANYONE**, **– THEY WILL RUIN YOUR HOLIDAY**

They gave us the camper with the grey water tank full and blocked. This meant we couldn’t use the shower or the sink because the water wouldn’t drain. In 15 days, no one from Indie Campers responded to our messages. As a result, we couldn’t take a single shower and had to rely on campsites.

Customer service never responded to us.

* The camper was dirty inside; no one had cleaned it.
* When we returned the vehicle, they charged us €60 because, according to them, the fuel level was one notch below where it was when we picked it up. Despite having taken photos of the dashboard proving that the fuel level was correct, they refused to acknowledge it.
* To this day, 50 days later, I still haven’t received my security deposit back. Once again, customer service is not responding.",0,2,1739207947.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1imbeld/avoid_to_rent_a_van_from_indie_campers_amsterdam/,Ok-Contest-5119

When is the best time of year to visit Amsterdam? ,"
I'm thinking of going to Amsterdam in the fall or winter. For those of you who have been there, which is better? 

Previously, I've visited Rome in February. I did so because it's the cheapest time of year to travel, and because it's not as crowded. Unfortunately, on my first trip, we had a major snowstorm the night before, which very nearly derailed things for me. My second trip went much more smoothly, but I do worry about the weather.

September and October are probably calmer and milder. On the other hand, it's probably more crowded than it is in winter, and with these crowds come higher airfare and hotel prices. 

So... in your experience, which option would be preferable? Am I better off just waiting a bit longer and taking my chances with the winter weather? 🤔 

(PS: As long as we're on the subject, how is it in August? I do want to keep my options open!) ",16,25,1714710812.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cj01oo/when_is_the_best_time_of_year_to_visit_amsterdam/,Real-Wolverine-8249
Amsterdam WONDR and AMAZE is it worth it?,"
It will be my first time in Amsterdam this weekend and me and my husband are
travelling over a prolonged weekend. 
I was checking on what to do in Amsterdam and go already some great stuff. 
Mainly looking for great food spots, fleamarket, secondhand etc. 
but then I also saw to museums that seemed very well received. 
So big question to the Amsterdam connoisseur, are WONDR and AMAZE worth the money and time? Or are we gonna be cramped and awkwardly waiting to see those scenes after tourists took their pictures? Are those places completely overfilled?

Final hours of my 16 months around the world trip,"**TLDR:** Made redundant at the end of 2022, didn't want to find another job. Packed up and travelled the world.

**update** done for now, flight soon, thanks for the questions. 

**update 2** ok really done now, boarding.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down. That coupled with the fact that we were cooped up after some of the most longest and strictest lockdowns it was time to get out and see the world.

The objective of the travels was essentially to explore and ""live"", as you will see most of the places we stayed were capital Cities. We ended up doing ALOT of day trips from the major capitals either by train or tour company. Most of the time it was much cheaper just to do a full day tour than to actually hire a car for the day.

Most of the places we stayed were booked through either [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Airbnb (booking.com was a much cheaper option most of the time)
